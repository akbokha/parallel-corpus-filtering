gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a horse ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remember their feast , they hunt in the fast Gal@@ lop in the home to the feed @-@ chambers .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with this the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament winners - close to horses .
he left himself with his family over the plant of the RV RV , on a horse he did not use any time for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports work handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ Pyram@@ id .
there is no doubt that he lacks the sympathetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ens@@ er kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ated him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is very much for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the price of 25.000 Euro straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 further outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ US Master@@ ran@@ ger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent include the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ den Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Ru@@ man Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ man Peter Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ ste@@ er Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ eh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports activities came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ e society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - this want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
however , the two US presidential elections are in control and energy policy as well as in primary demand .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
the state , of the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to hold the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and to be regulated to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different to the fact that Tru@@ mp is holding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely increase regulations and will power for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is saying , the state has given certain duties to open a disadvantage and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
into the must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ shipped .
the democratic application announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so in Tru@@ mp there could be even more in @-@ party discussions .
differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and go down again the coal promotion in the US .
oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton on the other hand wants to expand renewable energies with their investment programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , they both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of us want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade but simply protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are to be paid better then , asks for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage from 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase her to $ 15 per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp stands , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and its citizens to boost growth .
his critics point to it , so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; any frozen woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already towards everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby with it , the most one year old .
one laid her small son in her arms .
he was curious with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother kno@@ cks on the table @-@ top .
until it notices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are escaped .
they live in Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
unfortunately , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men have no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exaggerated to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any woman who arrives here has made on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically pro@@ secuted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women others weigh different reasons for the flight : &quot; many ste@@ aling from it because they do not see another way out . &quot;
in their home they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , hon@@ orary mor@@ als , slavery or ob@@ ses@@ pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water requires a sexual act , is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they ank@@ ar in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , women in refugees would often be regarded as inf@@ erior and worst if ab@@ used .
this leads to about 90 percent of women living in Munich &apos;s accommodation in the north , trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not made up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar to say that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often can not help to help , there will be more accommodations only for them , demands b@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they know from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , do not respond with No .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something in accommodations of the governments not .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women were not found alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ent@@ ou@@ cher of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some communal shel@@ ters or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central properties available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published by the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or women and women live together , there may be - constant violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women , is in the study .
how much women feel this protective sense , one can de@@ read in the And@@ ass@@ ment which there is to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since talking about it , we have a long queue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance in general : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representative of the Ass@@ istants have called on their union to author@@ ise new labour @-@ fighting measures in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has claimed its entire council , since the beginning of September has more work @-@ to @-@ use measures .
the J@@ DC said that he had agreed Ministers to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
ass@@ istants and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members elected to the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; pers@@ isted cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; to problems , which resulted in the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Management Board voted in accordance with the proposed new contract completely reject and official re@@ missions to all its concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board has provided a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council , in order to start a run programme of escal@@ ating work precautions , beginning of September .
the dispute led to the fact that Ass@@ istants this year occurred , the first total coinci@@ den@@ ces in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana entered the election of the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that were still taking place prior to the vote by 5@@ 4,000 ass@@ istants and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
according to the vote , the Minister of Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t told that the Treaty for doctors in England would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to pre@@ ach an official end to the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter @-@ players in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot f@@ end up to Ankara that Ankara wants that reconciliation most .
there was the envelope , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were mu@@ ddy , and he barely lit up heat , even for his back @-@ directed circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan is repeatedly speaking of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day he described a newspaper that Erdogan was so ben@@ ted as if there were never anything worse .
my enthusiasm seemed to give me the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool show that the President of Russia had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his leadership : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ alled .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in their backs .
the verb was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ apping again becomes difficult , if not impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations of senior officials from the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria could have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic state .
he has disputed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erdogan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are clear on hand .
Erdogan is primarily needed for all friends who he can get after finishing last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ er almost his Am@@ tes .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resum@@ ed .
you are counting on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
this week predicted the television television cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported goods again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in v@@ demo@@ sti forms it like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West since its response to the trying to take power over a weak response .
in addition , the continued Gro@@ ll come across the snow @-@ accession of the EU accession talks and Putin - the pi@@ ping to draw benefits from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian president in Ankara won a bonus to Ankara that he called for government officials after trying to support the elected state organs .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow a matter of fact , which itself has changed a deeper fear of regime .
the summit in this gl@@ oss palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one that once described me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; : two countries that have rejected and badly treated by the West and are now turning ill .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role of a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support conflic@@ ting sides .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial discussions , both President on the press conference said that they would not have stri@@ ped the subject once more .
the president of Turkey deliberately postponed a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as NATO member against Russia &apos;s Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads at least talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ Office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan passed the BBC Scotland with , that the R@@ BS brand were connected with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced themselves since they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , bran@@ ded str@@ ate@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references are listed , the de@@ centralized head@@ quarter and the stock exchange for Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private customer business which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand under which our employees are concerned , since we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank was transformed into a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now , I say that we are not pursuing a global goals , but follow local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different , and our staff will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that there will be no longer a six Nations sponsorship sponsor@@ ing it , and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the leader .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can lan@@ ci@@ er these brands , so I think that the time has come .

Russia Putin excit@@ ered Stab@@ at Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently released his staff leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for Trade@@ marks and Transport matters .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin without giving reasons , &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov sets out his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been deputy secretary since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 he was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious stat@@ ely Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it says ( in Russian ) that he later was a log chief and the executive director of the governing staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state chief of law enforcement and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked for it to leave his posts and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like it for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin that has been broadcast on television , both men claimed that the staff chief came back on his own wish .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one who knows .
but the official statement - that a man , who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once the Russian environmental policy wants to lead - came across large scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks by Putin , who quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years of age .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the state @-@ security service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who created the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin got in power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five guys , whom he trusted in the most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia in the second term , as a third presidential coup in violation of the Constitution .

Queens@@ bor@@ o Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have bound the northern deck of the Queens@@ bor@@ row crossing with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck @-@ bag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ gle .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown declared a visit to the building site today and was one of the first who went to the bridge from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Southern French crossing .
we are all witnesses of an engineer from a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the drawing between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
a total of nearly 79 % of the total ro@@ ses at its place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first decision marks a significant milestone in each of the bridge project .
this fantastic project marks the end of the tr@@ end@@ setting of tr@@ end@@ setting and deep @-@ construction .
after installing the last road cap and its connection with the northwest of the north@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to shut down the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , approximately 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of approx . 3 % had to be moved upwards .
heal , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side they put only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are still alive to be alive &quot;
three men have to be &quot; luck still alive &quot; after they were cast out of their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in security while their boat continued from their own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around for itself and turned us the worst , &quot; the leader of the b@@ ail@@ out of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds used the boat already except their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and on a boat without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the shore boat and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water will have luck left un@@ har@@ med and alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ motor made an emergency one , but these holes were loos@@ ened at the boots of the bot from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has awakened over these men today .

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be much stronger in the future in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next margins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group Leader by Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will in future be able to show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the big issue in the town hall is so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the political groups &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few as possible .
the left seeks even more hardness for investors .
regardless of what viol@@ a , viol@@ a is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the residential market .
if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we are getting the specialists .
however , the programme is not yet complete : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case .
how does one like the loss of other about 1300 @-@ priced apartments , whose funding will be exp@@ ired in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments up to 2020 .
to prevent this , the planning political speaker in Nicole Palm , should now purchase ongoing ties from the city now .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back to the pricing .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
one fell sw@@ oop to solve the problem .
in the West@@ stadt dates back to the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments can be returned there in the price of affordable housing .
only : we do not want the owners , the construction companies .
the number of social flats in the West stadt will dramatically increase dramatically away from the goal of the so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling .
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be no movement in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must go to the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , I have concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child does not go outside outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time spending , on monitors , has been in the last decade of many be@@ aks .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to it , of course , on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters who were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later originated from it an animated series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
as many phenomena of the pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July .
market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that the servers over@@ sized .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players are going to go outside with their smartphone and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( over a scre@@ enshot on the mobile ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the mar@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US the game led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 people re@@ pro@@ secuted , the Washington Post recently re@@ ap@@ ed that within two days of launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day , because many public messages are too dull and coming from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued .
whoever drives regularly , reduces its chances to dise@@ ased to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that too long is to guide them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people do so much outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people join hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are mur@@ der@@ ous kill@@ ings that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit already could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exagger@@ ate sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , and will help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the rain
forget the pressure .
forget about the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic at the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now also Olympi@@ asi@@ an instructor .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ year American gymn@@ ast mi@@ tig@@ ate the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes , below the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; - Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ es on the floating @-@ beam during the single @-@ workshop of women in the art centers at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American player who wins a multi @-@ club title and has a total of the fifth , as she fes@@ tering her reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated its sports@@ art last three years , including 15 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton from her said that she is the best gymn@@ ast I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected a last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the single @-@ campa@@ igning of women in the art centers at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es gathered the first medal at Tuesday , while at the retirement party of his retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a pro@@ dig@@ al character .
though it existed , during their long sign@@ age to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not really true .
a part of their ground exercises - which included their typical tumor passport - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the road outside the Olympi@@ ad arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by their grandparents as a little child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school distance to the gymn@@ asium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was tra@@ ded , became a force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 it has not lost any additional competition , a victory series that will stop as long as it wants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Must@@ af@@ ina did easily lead through two la@@ ins , the picture turned out .
Swedish @-@ beams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the world &apos;s title - lau@@ ded .
they went back again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ener - and set one on the ground with 15,@@ 6@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her when they were expecting her En@@ der@@ g@@ amma - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flooded with Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection book .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina went .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called by the Americans , &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their ground exercise , they cast out the audience Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which is sometimes doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for it , the spread @-@ end twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ous case of music killed in the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous case of Phoenix while listening and hearing music in the car .
Angela Merkel Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator threw eight shots from a fire @-@ fire@@ arm while he stood on the car &apos;s side of the car and fled then with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police divided that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a boot@@ leg of the beast , because the Att@@ acker took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sh@@ ale has led the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic dormit@@ ories were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks and two more injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard was the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of her injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that took place on an empty Pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his aging enjoyed Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy knew nothing .
when he first came home my first thought , I didn &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself let myself .
what is not true at all -- of course you left out on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund may never be recognized among circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some physicians even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still make , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Edmund could not sit or cr@@ abs up to his third age of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign that is Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something about &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign @-@ language to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign -- she says . Edmund has invented several signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mascul@@ in@@ or during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of the infected virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and they do not know yet .
I haven &apos;t been asked for a prognosis for a long time since I am not expecting her to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ avirus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls spar@@ ked , &quot; survived san@@ itation in Philadelphia
the police for@@ ks that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year child will be shot .
the grandparents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grandparents gave that Brown suffered several shots , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in his transport to hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot through , his small body was sol@@ dered by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ish@@ z on the transm@@ itter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the state of the boy was classified in a hospital and had to undergo several operations .
the Family of the Young shared the transm@@ itter , that he is likely to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people launched in German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was built on the front @-@ seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is located in a critical condition , recorded the transm@@ itter .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine among the women &apos;s Olympic Council and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been at each summer olymp@@ ic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &apos;s Her@@ nan@@ dez , who worked for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and h@@ isp@@ anic presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman in the last four years .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise in the competition and in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world world cup in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ atic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ week event for women .
man @-@ member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see the classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ns in the crew . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ tles are a dear@@ er sport and gymn@@ asts be maintained primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents , which pay for the training , furnishings , travel and hotel rooms ( for the trainers and their families and families ) . the list can be continued .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these associations , the gymn@@ asts receive their overall training and that is for families an expensive and long @-@ term engagement .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ bo .
we need to open the churches au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to provide a better and easily accessible gym .
I was founded my turn@@ foundation of 20 years .
we offer a free and affordable tur@@ bo in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbines that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ tles develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this squ@@ ad that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ bo and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you will be motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
ass@@ istants would like to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t proposal
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,000 ass@@ istants who voted in voting .
in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans unvei@@ led the agreement to introduce the contract in an &quot; No Man &apos;s land &quot; and would be harmful to any further del@@ aying for the employees and patients .
the first ass@@ istants are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night@@ mar@@ - and week @-@ end@@ ages to improve the care for periods of time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR cub@@ its Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ es appointed last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ass@@ istants have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will be the current staff crisis and administered to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks can be involved in the government and sometimes silence at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ af@@ ening silence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only last month in the last month , that his door was always open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the penetration and address the concerns of the ass@@ istants . &quot;
if he does not do this , the ass@@ essors have made clear that they are ready to conduct further work @-@ amp@@ ut@@ measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 staff@@ s , since nur@@ ses were involved to provide doctors on the strike string .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better surge for the 5@@ 4,000 ass@@ istants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ timer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working fight measures have nothing but little , but already stra@@ ined teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only , emergency and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the ass@@ istants of the ass@@ istants and responded positively to the healthcare Ministry of Health and other ministries , and have responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , extra training for those who were returning from a career plan , training courses and gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - a sign for this was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer time period .
the framed T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , causing the risk of stro@@ kes or a further heart attack .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0.000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of this suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the arteries nar@@ rates that form sie@@ ge .
when the sie@@ ge breaks off , it can cause a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting that causes blood flow to the heart and thus caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ utter is trig@@ gers , it can flow through blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who had already submitted a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca , and distributed under the name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ot@@ ters more likely .
the initial design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE healthcare evaluation center said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attack and stro@@ kes among people who had already a heart attack .
by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options available to thousands of people who can benefit from them .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the initial design recommends not recommen@@ ding treatment that exceeds that period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tus can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was last year on dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tus has led to that wide @-@ wi@@ dened election was accidentally ignored in Muslim communities , like a crus@@ hing government report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les took up the police , electoral monitoring and Rath@@ eh@@ ouses to have evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ethical and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , who now is a antagon@@ ism , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off hing@@ es outside of electoral cabins to protect voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a identification with him in order to prove their identity by elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a vot@@ er must merely name its name and address .
the report proposes to refu@@ te the finger of a person if she dis@@ likes her electoral voice to prevent anyone choosing twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official compromise or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud but also the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial union culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ tions than in the east of London .
last year , a special dish Court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man ought to corro@@ bor@@ ate corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes .
the court was that Rah@@ man would per@@ ple@@ xed the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to vote him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which one person chooses one else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming with frau@@ dul@@ ous brief@@ ing - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the feeding of out to prove the identity
in his report says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elder , in particular in communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions should not know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke of 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist dra@@ ins work , to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory is used to immig@@ rant and welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to your selection .
if not remote tin@@ ts use on the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent anyone choosing twice .
systematic verification of the nationality of a person to perform to make sure they are in@@ eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on requests to an automatic re@@ election .
ban that political activ@@ ist permits complete brief@@ ing elections and envel@@ opes of brief@@ ing elections .
the police give the authority to set up down@@ time for electoral centres .
a legislative change , which makes an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representative Act 1983 ) .
photograph offered in choice of choice .
requirement that only English must be used in the election centres ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff generally enforce that voters leave alone in the election cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric goes through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case it has been released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election Tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sufficiently well @-@ known because of a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exit control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ passed in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is the mother of the parliaments , a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered proliferation of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ists in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are advised this week on the French cyclists of Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge of the band who proved to be impressive double @-@ wheel@@ ers in the Her@@ zo@@ gin of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to have gold @-@ fine athlete who has his own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not if you can believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that wor@@ sen the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ken , which have more than just a certain similarity with el@@ ly@@ cop@@ ities .
the hunters and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
except for double @-@ wheel@@ ers in the radar r@@ ink there are many people on the internet that could be like a certain arch@@ ant of the Gem@@ ini of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the madness in the social media with and gave him that he has been hearing from childhood since childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see a big similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I can look at the well as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the open similarity between the British For@@ war@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be crossed for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers
another persistent comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the son@@ nen@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord on , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others are the similarities .
theory in the space provided : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer car@@ p@@ enter are virtually identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the American football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular comparisons embr@@ aced the Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , broad smile , that resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the network also exc@@ used quickly and gave a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that it will be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday we quickly apologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments refers to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy chosen formulation . B@@ yron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was apologi@@ zing in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming team in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took care of the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged over women who tried in the middle of the business under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see it , when a woman pulled her clothes in the midst of a mar@@ row to try to try sub@@ tro@@ users .
to wor@@ sen the situation , they insp@@ ected them as she looked , and laid it back to the shelf .
you browse and tried four pairs of sau@@ cers at a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she left again and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales surface , they took a pair of shel@@ ters from the list , pulled their own whirlpool and pants and try them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a slightly discreet place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ing when she returns the under@@ pants , who obviously did not like her because they put them down to the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that her turned nothing to be back and out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt someone watching - or thinking about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants that she tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think that somebody would take shelter with his home and who had not been washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have been given , the staff tries to draw the pieces from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and finding out that another woman had she had she had and had not been washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our Fili@@ ale in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all of the products in question were sold out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate the mirror for your inc@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you move from the back then you should turn to the most , so you can see your att@@ acker and move away from the push line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
then take him down with his knee into the gro@@ in and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker fights face pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards while taking the weapon on him .
with att@@ ackers you approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the loop , grab the gun and rot@@ ate it , so that the Att@@ acker cannot shoot .
shift the weight on the weapon at the same time and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle , before moving back@@ wards and raise the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ power .
but remember that there is a rob@@ bery in the safest area , as long as you are not a Kra@@ i Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .

but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ s@@ nap a traction bur@@ dock , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact they are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
Mr Wright with doctors and medical specialists in Europe spoke about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he abandoned , more than a poor neighbor in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of its intest@@ ines by travelling through the world , and for a good as well as wonderful things .
from public transportation to stations to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he told him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ amm@@ ing water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was definitely meeting his reputation .
only what he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial @-@ coating showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ ometer from over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ etres is fresh s@@ wir@@ ed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om that he refused to swal@@ low off after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters was over 4000 units , while having freshly gri@@ lled hands one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the guide &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I have taken in a toilet , near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no mut@@ ation than that !
I will not touch here , because it is in@@ sol@@ itary here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company will be re@@ funded Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us that contains both Mil@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the advantages of probio@@ tics are explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , so that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and documentary film , we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala who led the director of the film , &quot; said : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have liked some of the things that I have instructed him to le@@ ak , just like the ek@@ el@@ ory Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to attach it and others that was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey conducted by 2015 Associ@@ ated 84 percent of all respondents in survey , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that contain attached l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a Eur@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terrorist its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
having been evacu@@ ated by its estate from its estate , we found sho@@ cking the property in a mis@@ par@@ able state .
the walls made cla@@ ff@@ ing holes , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ trained and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , which works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people do not need to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in time in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ated , street fights with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ists , intimi@@ dated by residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , quar@@ rels and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old trash was found
it was torn in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past drugs
neighbors said they saw them on the streets and regularly had to be called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing appointed her and her partner this week from the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , which said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she turned not to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived in addition to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was rec@@ alled at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the Common House were trash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the tenants can meet any responsibility for their behaviour and the family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is always the last step that is taking into consideration Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case , because behaviour was extremely difficult and must be horri@@ fying for their neighbours terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the municipality , who have been brave and made us have made the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development is con@@ sol@@ ation with some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which in one of the bedrooms of the house left behind the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication on the floor .
workers of the property management are now forced to miss garbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ an@@ age , par@@ ap@@ partments and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after being guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial control .
they claimed that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of their son Lee He@@ don was , who came to life in 2013 with an automobile accident .
having gone without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many carp@@ entry of the house were lubric@@ ated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said that they will del@@ li@@ ze tenants who do not stick to the domestic order
Angela C@@ row was issued by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that del@@ o@@ ds hold a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the home order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ accus@@ ations as well as those who have been damaged by such behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic at once a ti@@ eff@@ ered jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft was almost pal@@ p@@ able close to the sun@@ beds on the beach @-@ section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers ran@@ ged when they in@@ comprehensible , worries about the noise of the kis@@ ses to make , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers who made videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nun@@ o arrogan@@ ce added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down upon me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deeply
the Portuguese air forces gave today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was on a training flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep flying that this was the only way to recognize it .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet due to the poor view@@ points flew slightly lower than usual , but pers@@ isted the air forces that safety at no time was at risk .
Fle@@ et stocks have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on the island Madeira came to death .

Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step of the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans confront the Spanish Super@@ cup in du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , against the FC Sevilla , the rear @-@ game increases three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ ed has to do without the under@@ ru@@ gged C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who will best ride the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter is missing .
the German exp@@ ir@@ ation in the training had a change in the knee , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca could at least be clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen in Barcelona have been around the status as number one for two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coach Luis En@@ rique was having a clear decision on this so far and did Bra@@ vo in the league for but T@@ er ste@@ er in the majority of the remaining applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the first draft of the new season there is a doubt about the fitness state of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ s@@ al@@ stop against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. are not really convincing .
Seville in turn has to di@@ gest 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and strives to di@@ gest the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona has previously eleven successes of record winning in this competition .

this makes the World Ranking First the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected to play in the final game and made the title each other .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row the Chinese would pick up a single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the record alone , between the records and in time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches in itself .
they withdrawn their way to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ector in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had not said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game @-@ posed gold and silver medal awarded the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had really worked with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
then he set the pace on the record and let Z@@ hang on it only a total of 13 points .
by the superiority of Ma developed , not the expected match .
but nevertheless there were sufficiently stunning ball@@ ots .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze at the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the white cit@@ rus had settled in his quarter @-@ finals against the German Europ@@ ame@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ ja Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov a Ri@@ ppen@@ breaking , after that in the medical treatment , he had to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with ble@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way in similar table tennis rac@@ ers .
Donald Tru@@ mp adm@@ its ″ form@@ id@@ able problems ″ in the electoral campaign
the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states to submit their majority .
presidential ass@@ an@@ did@@ at Donald Tru@@ mp there were weaknesses of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can Utah .
a rare moment , in which usually usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is such a thing as concerns vo@@ iced , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after 16 ri@@ vals was thrown out of the race at the same republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp before protest@@ ant Christians , which he asked for assistance in key federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame for false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he picked up his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can high@@ bur@@ gers
Utah is a safe bank for the Republi@@ can Re@@ public@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , according to Tru@@ mp and his bankrupt@@ cy from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ alled .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by far the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as endangered also , Arizona and Georgia are considered endangered .
in an interview by the Bro@@ ther CN@@ BC she answered Tru@@ mp on the question of how he wants to stop progression Clin@@ ically again : &quot; just as I did it now . &quot;
and whether I am back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make any other than &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
if it &apos;s not rich for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , whether in order , Tru@@ mp said further .
then I will return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tru@@ mp is alleged to present funds to support his electoral campa@@ igning , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of it one wants to seize the candidates of the re@@ public@@ ans for Congress stronger among the arms .
Olympia : pi@@ ister fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics is threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud test on a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with , immediately set up a discipline Commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan Func@@ tional has told that the former Spr@@ inter and present Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , placed a urine trial under the name of 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ äu@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this may have been reported to the team pipe of Kenya from the dop@@ ing controllers .
the World association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C to provide information about the event in order to rigor@@ ously evaluate their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it says in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and has presented itself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the rehearsal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls in the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was 2015 in Beijing World Championship @-@ Vier@@ ter over 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ man Heads of Delegation Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been dra@@ fted by the Rio Olympics .
he should have informed against money @-@ payments of his country on upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media report , he was alleged to have been arrested in his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been in the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing closures have been under special observation for a longer time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Olympics , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into being .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency has had a lot of pressure on African countries before the summer play , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a working control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics &apos; start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the wake of the W@@ ada Kenya , the W@@ ada Kenya was taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against the rules of W@@ ada are . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the athle@@ tics of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reporting of the ARD , more and again alleg@@ ations were raised , that in Kenya , dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be considerable mentality of sport fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und also called for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he had placed them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport type , nationwide and systematically developed .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg Upper West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival explores the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a Musi@@ cal conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the music into the Temple of Classi@@ cal , and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan orchestra Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we found Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older si@@ fied Mary .
she reminds himself of melanch@@ oly of her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character that I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singers : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is an extremely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is all very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we got the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same themes and they are just as sa@@ iled as they were then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died after information of her family shortly after she predicted to leave the war @-@ exploited country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that are the risks that are associated with them to go into a war zone - people think of them ever to make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then take a bus to the Syrian border .

Turkey : Kurdish community pays off with mass cur@@ sed
&quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is lo@@ dged , sits on packed bags , &quot; says the relation of the Gü@@ len @-@ Middle Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany expects short @-@ term prot@@ ections that flee from Turkey to Germany in short term .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds &quot; thousand , &quot; the exile @-@ CEO Ali top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard struggle of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community is expecting a mass cur@@ sed to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand @-@ thousand guards from Turkey in Germany if the Erdogan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had passed over recent months ago , some 500@@ ,000 Kurds from Turkey are at the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the disp@@ osed of coup , there are still secular and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
many will begin to restart in Europe when they continue to be sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that took refugees in its own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief chief compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this makes Erdogan the rival pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been ex@@ terminated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader called for the German government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; Wit@@ ches @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
I feel no more secure in the last months for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also feared the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire @-@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ adher@@ ents , teachers and other academ@@ ics , are the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is lo@@ dged , sits on packed bags , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Middle Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported by calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Labour , the Turks received the biggest group in front of the coup against political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on June 30th , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all are justified as a treatment ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this collection cannot be found before war , poverty or the fu@@ tility of thought .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state of state , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stran@@ gely Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heav@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for blind@@ ing as far as hitherto it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ keepers - this is attached . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals , who are to be convinced of the fighters are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they can &apos;t choose the country &apos;s day .
to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who are hanging the posters , ballo@@ ons , and at the end voices count , only fatigue full .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday Day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has yet to go over to the people after an election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say this at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly in surveys behind the CD@@ U .
exciting how strong new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ nal remaining .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government chief , makes an almost in@@ con@@ stri@@ ction campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , as it did already his legendary @-@ car@@ nate predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors have got his old feet , and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel gives the blame for the flowering of the A@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him a beautiful position now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is when you make the wrong time at the right place for electoral campaign .
she has been invited to visit Angela Merkel twice a chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ; Merkel Bundestag ) is located in the northeast .
but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg &apos;s Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent co@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a shame to hear anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U cast largely on the usual electoral campa@@ ig@@ es on market positions and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so does Co@@ ert , play only an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lower part &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has stated that you were cru@@ mb@@ led on the country that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are about the left , the SPD , the Green : in the vast@@ ness of the country barely any .
the Council of the CD@@ U comb@@ at@@ ant Kok@@ ert to its competitors is however also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden We@@ ddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly committed electoral campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should lead the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue from the holidays hard@@ ship and put their electoral campaigns in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaigns &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls it the Landes@@ Officer Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green constitu@@ encies embark on sp@@ ur@@ king search for local stim@@ ul@@ ties among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading can@@ did@@ at@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : restaurant sites suffering from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and will only end up at 8@@ pm , there are all praise praise .
&quot; they did everything rather h@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the jet gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no de@@ duction .
the construction site could be moved on the weekend to the half @-@ time planned to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also be praised for the construction work responsible for the construction work , such as the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ein@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was emig@@ rated on Monday to the south and the block of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is rebuilt , the traffic situation inside the town has relaxed .
citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
air traffic through the place seems to come back .
&quot; there were partly considerable discomfort , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Director Florian King for the transport management of the rehabilitation .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many narrow paths looked for and more their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some lor@@ ries in residential areas were ver@@ ste .
as the speed limit were not observed , the community also called for the measurement of aircraft from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been lit@@ tered .
the fastest was on the pace with 77 km @-@ kilometers in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been further attracted , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
in the maps , business@@ men don &apos;t want to look like .
but , however , that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to a turnover break@@ through@@ s , one lets you look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thus produced for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds significant words .
this is an exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the places have made it &quot; hard hit . &quot;
they were missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales cat@@ ered down on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road @-@ tuning was thrown back to its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there might be a financial compensation , otherwise benef@@ itted the Gast@@ stätte , otherwise from the advantages of location at the B 27 . now , they also have the disadvantages that result from refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where some gener@@ ously was handled .
with all boxes , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled in the past 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history of history .
that other regul@@ ars are less often subject to the complicated traffic of traffic , he can understand .
if you cannot escape , it is also elsewhere .
that its regular climate after the end of the restoration work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird @-@ barbecue , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
constantly under the name of the terrorist fight against laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now making a ph@@ atter security package .
but what has a dem@@ nity status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ iler zu &quot; say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are calling for no one .
others , further @-@ related points would first be discussed within the parties .
even in this participation I will participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as interior minister , it is ideally located to him and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; session consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , a little bit of time before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are even the more extensive ones .
a lot is already known , announced , proclaimed : that a new security authority should take care of the cr@@ acking encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on air travel data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been to do with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ize with the terrorist groups with double citizenship , with a double citizen of the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless he consider this to reasonable and demanding too nothing , which in case of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ aries have no chances anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they have partly in itself : he plans to de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
refugees who are systematically pursued in the country should be able to check their smartphone in advance and disclose social media account for a security examination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for distr@@ acted asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about such that commit crimes , or reject their papers in order to conce@@ al their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of this is political and legal .
sometimes it is still un@@ pronounced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in case of im@@ patient treatment , for example - the question arises : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to argue that the assass@@ ination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg Refu@@ ge@@ es were .
there were also many people concerned with the high refugees concerned about the security of the refugees .
and things that are deeply employed people were unable to complain about in election periods .
the internal security is enormous into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly focusing on internal security .
between the two parties there went high in the last few days .
only a gar@@ ger &apos;s argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety policy collection of some Uni@@ ons &apos;s Interior , in which the intelligent@@ sia is also a bul@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also te@@ ached here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a stop from the double @-@ pass it is nothing .
we have agreed the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ make you anew , be not sensible .
and on a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it actually is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is required for the co@@ ali@@ um partner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in store , which could take care of dispute .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ p himself on the subject of internal security .
party CEO Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled again carefully to talk and says , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving safety . &quot;
still , Volkswagen pl@@ ung@@ ed by .
despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery pay worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
in the back @-@ off reaction there is a pro@@ men@@ bel for a term .
Volkswagen starts to deliver the deliveries to the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s largest highways can continue to rise in the course of the year despite the diesel of diesel thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July the VW brand weak@@ ened the brand VW , above all in Western Europe and is thus bur@@ dened for the full sale , as well as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
the VW brand sold the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales stood 14 per cent below the prior @-@ year period .
in the home market Germany sh@@ ackle the shipment to almost one @-@ sixth .
brand Prime Minister Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly on two selling days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , it was given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the resignation of the EU have also been deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhau@@ st initially escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly affected house@@ keeping brand of the Lower Saxony is still further glimp@@ sed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is just a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to Bu@@ che .
consolidated balance : Fred Cap@@ pl@@ ers from January to July was able to set up a sales split from January to July .
1,3 per cent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhau@@ st .
in Germany , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million vehicles to re@@ armament in the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or power@@ train .
the motorway exit the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed same &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in a corporate trip .
the reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reports , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee of constant diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would have confirmed this last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the traffic Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA can be accomplished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from that are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after re@@ armament are no deterior@@ ations and all type of approved vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that customers come for example a half year after re@@ armament coming into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage , which have nothing to do with the sc@@ anning sc@@ andal , to an uncertainty with regard to possible guarantees , as it was meant .
therefore , VW uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; not .
the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich divisions in the future - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank@@ boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ date accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher bank speaks of a single case and does not see that signal : normal austerity would have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to fear for their austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money through night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent criminal offen@@ se .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for in@@ soles over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ date accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs in future will cost € 400 in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not fail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie in the central bank account and cause a 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every one million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost he shall continue after the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply leave to the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four exagger@@ ations , I don &apos;t say the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have an understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the genius of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is significant at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to carry you alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business economically permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ zin@@ sen for deposits starting from three million euros the Thur@@ in@@ gian Parliament and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger country had made headlines with their skat@@ ebo@@ bank branch 2014 headlines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , captain of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay a nationwide coverage for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ kers said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there are &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is something lush from the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gen@@ os@@ cop@@ s@@ bank G@@ mund was founded in 1911 , in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gen@@ os@@ cop@@ s@@ verband Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate an outlet for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go neg@@ atives with the private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and thre@@ es the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .

destination plates : who is actually buying records ?
lonely men of middle age love plates .
before you get to the commentary in order to rev@@ ise it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non Al@@ le@@ Ein@@ sam@@ man &apos;s men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the profound re@@ development of Schall@@ platten is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the unity of physical objects , but to the mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while I sit in the middle of a busy road in Soho , a modest gray approach and wild@@ ly , before I stick , my hands hold and something determining how : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let us take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman the camera to turn off the camera in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I go by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably about the 20 ) succession , is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
this sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail . I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his apartment .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy objects he sold as he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70@@ ies , which was published when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who are buying the plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I will not drink very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the medi@@ enh@@ pe people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have prompted themselves to buy their old records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually have been forced to emp@@ t their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the plate grounds of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to see that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the contac@@ tless payment system .
some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar sound@@ pl@@ atten@@ tions , of objects , and happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ers .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s so .
it is a simple way to engage mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of a record @-@ stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not heard yet .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I b@@ lower through a stack at Bos@@ sa Nova Komp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspects &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ als .
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radio head record , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it will definitely happen .
more production @-@ las@@ hing , less music cl@@ as@@ per .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only slowly rein@@ forces them .
F@@ stop , which has devoted the sound board to almost a whole floor , has a small audience , when I go down .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenage boys and women middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts Re@@ ester syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ier pop instead of experimental jazz . by speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks sunny , but wet mental trau@@ mata are hard to det@@ ectable if you stand for up to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more of a mannequ@@ in as a major purchase .
she does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or another , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she is driving with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it truly is unique .
my last stop is a shop , by which it is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban out@@ fit .
while I seem to mu@@ te the je@@ ans the je@@ ans hot@@ bed , I watch a group of young teenagers , which group for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter consider themselves to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them up .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these objects will mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates .
even though my inquiries made the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in records in Soho , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and in online for@@ es , un@@ considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their Thursday morning with certainty from record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they en@@ vy to the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year old moder@@ ator , which prot@@ ru@@ des over the shoulders of the middle age .

French Court re@@ jects offering of demo@@ lition of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week ar@@ omas the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional stores , sell cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ soft , sell , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Pre@@ fecture Cal@@ ais was argu@@ ing that these places should be crus@@ hed because they would be a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and which a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the stat@@ ely supported association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they went out that the provisional stores and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for expulsion of people who run 72 provisional businesses , but sp@@ urs the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than just people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places which was threatened by the decay , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp which is operated as well @-@ known and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe would be , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany Ras@@ ch has to set itself to the next generation of speed monitor : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should lead the tem@@ pe@@ el of especially effective .
the futur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at in@@ genu@@ ity , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction or to san@@ ent bridges , with temporary temp@@ er there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary aper@@ ture for the speed of speed .
a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery stops five days with uninterrupted measuring operation five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also be seized of all vehicles over several tracks at the same time .
variable velocity constraints , as well as transit options after time , travel and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly driven condition one can move the pend@@ ant loud to manufacturers using any car with app@@ cl@@ utch .
so that it is not easy to look , it is lowered to the measurement , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured tank will also disappear in a safe outside .
also , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer for information of Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal states and are now also employed .
also foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has recovered 100 pieces of Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after passing master@@ class gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ aler stage .
Fiji shared a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , follow @-@ up and rotating power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any colour .
the defeat was sent by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they were able to take pride in their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals .
however , no one would have defeated in this form a 15 @-@ man team .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former manager for England from Wimbledon .
Britain had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she was lost in Ryan of any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop is going to do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks GB@@ s out of fun dra@@ ining .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co. at the moment one would run in driving buses . the World Series @-@ winner went from 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with still four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai has yet another attack from the right corner that he turned into .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely made the ball lab@@ eled .
a hot flas@@ hy tail of Mitchell stops the mountain of husband Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has not only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a took a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the Rest@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tactics of the GB teams and stor@@ med down to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s so , as if Fiji was born to play 7 , while GB still continue to read .
this is how it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes for half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left @-@ hand corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Pacific , whose fans sang , che@@ eks and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the cake cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff er@@ ön@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB ki@@ cked off crus@@ hing in the law@@ ns .
previous on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeats and Britain crow@@ ned South Africa in a scarce half @-@ final match of the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke out the line with an impressive foot@@ work , and scored a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant ceremony of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , won the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing machines
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ ship gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stroke of up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , die in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two who sat at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present as her for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old at two without tax wife in a row driven by the first women in the history of the British sport who laid such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ 0@@ un@@ ted use , which is also unparalleled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al to da@@ zzle .
behind every gold in the herd there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to wil@@ ful hero@@ ines who account the difference and it was no one assistant as the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed in cancer .
as he said he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operating and they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start treatment early 2014 , out of season , could start what the interruption occurred to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
the herd of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ ad@@ ability of victory they went their first thought to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ up morning and tried to talk more than usual and therefore tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery Regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan said , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I could not have wished for a better person to carry out a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark closed , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had to reserve a lot in reserve .
we were very trapped at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make a bit of Tol@@ les .
we did not want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer group , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , goes to retirement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association is considered as a &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small fres@@ her drinking water @-@ purpose linked as an example to the big water producers .
it said some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the Wasser@@ forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken got the Second association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer @-@ group was &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Second association , was 28 years old as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 in retirement .
the drinking water @-@ purpose Association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of wides@@ brunn , promotes a year about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters water and provides 32 places and past@@ ors with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the municipalities Church lou@@ der , wides@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ tah .
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
the current Chairman , latitude in Ger@@ tru@@ de stages ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was set as a water@@ mark and was appointed to the managing director of the Second Association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational skills , the bud@@ get@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency approaches at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , basic @-@ sc@@ rap materials in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ modelling of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the parts of water management .
there has been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I always added new innovations because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised her loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart bloo@@ dies@@ t for his water@@ purpose and he lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer group for the nit@@ rate meeting in front of the District Forum des District Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the one hand , Al@@ f@@ on Sem@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
the highlights from his point of view he describes the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Second Association .
the greatest challenge and the hardest use were the pi@@ ping at the high @-@ lift in church lou@@ der on an 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at once again can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ ling .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel storms from lou@@ der , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and stated to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his partner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ acher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him become publicly noticed .
by now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burnt , and has a lat@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the police has published a photo of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be directly addressed .
he can still carry the weapon in himself , so the police .
who sees Sven S. will call the 110 call .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship &quot; .
the victim is the year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
the relevant police in Lü@@ beck initially wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ator and the victims ; but she confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; this is a killing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more , we are not currently saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said a poli@@ ze@@ ch in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for Germans steel industry
the cr@@ ust @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by extra costs in meg@@ acities .
financial bur@@ dens that thre@@ aten the industry from the oil , are from the table .
it remain in the liberation of the renewable energies of energy production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the Ho@@ cho@@ ke to generate electricity for your own consumption , to checkout .
in the steel industry , the steel industry acquired an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now I give an elementary certificate with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators used in the steel machines are replaced , all have an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for power supply .
in this way , the status quo of the current regulation will be largely complete .
I have special significance in Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment targets can be seen as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall facilit@@ ator Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer of commodities in the face of the weak@@ ening demand of mass steel in the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel cutting prices .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
to a clear cut @-@ on import duties on imports of water , on the other hand , the economic prospects of China have accumulated in China .
unclear how lasting the cost @-@ conditioning is unclear .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p was careful on Thursday .
most recently the prices would have been more st@@ agn@@ ant again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to do not include lock@@ ers of individual works .
in the German steel industry around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturer remain vigil@@ ant despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tons of less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year on how the economic association made steel on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the set @-@ set quantity went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in the months to come , the association expects an improved order result in the coming months .

so far she is doing something good for her health and her mind .
for singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German seniors .
most Sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular inter@@ connection , the elderly can build and maintain social contacts .
for frequently , social and family structures emerge at age , a chorus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
after doing so , seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever requests his lungs are not so fast in everyday life and not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz , of the Federal Employment Association of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people is w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and particularly melodies arise themselves den@@ sely denied people in long run events .
at S@@ ingen the head is also called for a special power , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , exercise themselves not only in themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you learn through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing by singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I look for something for a long time , I will be better and awake over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says , have little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people , who he@@ ars when a sound goes out next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a retirement choir , you can just connect .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
those who wish to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or church officials .
many seniors also find over the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the internet .
those who desire has to sing should join in a chorus , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is doing the soul well and has something fre@@ eing , that applies to every age .
cats react sensitive as han@@ go@@ ver on cry of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover which effect the herd of kittens on adult animals has .
to her surprise the male also did not let the males cold - however they kept in the difference to the females always alike .
female cats can see the arousal level of kittens by the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens that have found themselves in great need , as scientists have found out by the veterinary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( U@@ hh ) .
the han@@ go@@ ver also react on the loop of kittens . however , always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ cks of less and strongly aroused young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding said from the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the Fach@@ magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and ton@@ ing of the kittens with the urgency of their help is distinguished .
in total , nine grown @-@ ups and eight were observed from the animal shelter of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a charge of little ones who were taken out of the throw @-@ box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ blings .
secondly , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens who were additionally raised up .
the researchers consider their results in spite of the low sampling test for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded to the cry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker , when this Ru@@ fe played the very well @-@ aroused kit@@ ties .
this ability may be innate or developer with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noise .
also , some studies show that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they have been mothers or not , Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski returns with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the erst@@ while soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey there is another important football game .
in front of the du@@ el of the Archbishop Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to visit the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is obvious : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already with the suspension of acceptance after the overthrow of the trial in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ h@@ ers should not be imp@@ aired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not apply to those who are suspected the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the coup attempt .
and even before the football did not stop .
against the previous Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South of America in America is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ l@@ r is intended to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan .
although , initially for 90 days , it is still considered until October , in fact , it did not affect the life of most Turks but as good as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ orph@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public places in the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split in supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
especially fans of the working club visit traditionally not belong to the friends of the president .
what the Gro@@ s of Turks but given dram@@ atic experiences in the history unites the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is beating for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ ran@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be especially arriving on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the seas@@ oned season proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sie@@ g@@ tre@@ ffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found the dis@@ appoint season for the record champion a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also appear early in the Europe League early .
in the South of Li@@ g it was only reached position six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Ba@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who came with 26 seasonal rati@@ os as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ scor@@ er bra@@ king the basis of the 14th tracks .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old year .
in doing so , during the AC Florence Treaty , the Gom@@ ez was made out of Rome under a contract and was not disclosed to the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; if Mario want to come to us , he just have to say it , &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club leader Fi@@ Cre@@ t Or@@ man .
to do this , the lin@@ mer would have to be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around one third of his to 7.5 million euros a year , that &apos;s clear : &quot; its content in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have fun opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio to get medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines how to play the Head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swimming in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock of her Star@@ law shortly before playing ( 100 meters chest ) gr@@ in@@ ous and b@@ lown off at its start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
as a pre@@ occupation that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a ju@@ bilee .
but there are many more athletes , who , despite dop@@ ing past at Rio Olympics , go to the start .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already been closed for two times because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ an of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champions runs even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time olymp@@ ic teacher and si@@ eben@@ fold world cup in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after it was detected the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , who defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympi@@ asi@@ bility of 2012 , world championship tested in 2013 and Europe from 2010 to 2016 , tested on the bot@@ tom@@ ed stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic ride the si@@ eve intake and was locked six months .
the four most common thro@@ ws in this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ ene .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and had been blocked 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement might have been responsible , de@@ aler@@ ted track .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is more than 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest growing man in the world .
I@@ wan Ty@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athlete have been recognized as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Championship title from 2005 nine years later , after having noticed testosterone levels .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also realized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 , due to a great part of the International Sport@@ sman , CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , he is on the rank two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Go@@ ing , China ) : the world @-@ class and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin has only been tested positive in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 year @-@ old world cup , notes on the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement has been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian in South Africa - Sever@@ al victims
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
it suffered cap@@ tives and was treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
your home trip will be planned for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holidays of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , Austrian citizens are also still not yet unclear .
the State Department stood in close contact with local authorities , so dum@@ b .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ Hua H@@ in , first on Thursday evening , two bombs were explo@@ ded on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thailand has been killed and about 20 people have been injured , including Austria , three Germans , three low@@ lands and three Italians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning again two explo@@ sives went high , and a further man was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb was reported in the morning .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb was explo@@ ded by an urban settlement .
the jumping mat is according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ et before the Re@@ four of the coastal police have gone into the air .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on at the southeast coast are several injured .
you go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ un@@ ate bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning from journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ate muscular separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , explained the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs were laid by enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities in recent days have received secret services on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but not informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet it is not yet unclear which group behind the attacks was stopped .
the police took its officials across the country to enhance security around major government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bombs , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bomb attack , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities to make a consequence .
high safety risks ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ kings and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , they are not necessary for necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this adm@@ its to the military will also have a great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bombs should be an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military in@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , keeps the right to have guided the kingdom back to stability and order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a handle on the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , a proposal to a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody ons@@ lau@@ ght of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is at the Visi@@ er of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the constitutional complaint in the federal government also made up the group under observation .
&quot; we see in the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; clue to efforts against the liber@@ als democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Prime Minister Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , native Islamic faith or from the Middle East will be diff@@ used in a extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; Un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by over@@ alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitu@@ tion@@ er in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely matched to the country with the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to take their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extremis@@ ts , they speak to you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ le music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the identities of Islam@@ ists as well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right wing extremis@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is intended to address people emo@@ tionally .
young people are generally suscep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , there were reports of several federal states reports on contacts of &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species would be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction , and thus extrem@@ ist in the extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such people control the influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase of law @-@ motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of a new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that it can give extreme frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
it may well be that further righteous groups or petty @-@ groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks from other far @-@ right motives plan .
however , a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of justification is not recognizable .
the previous groups should be based on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned Ma@@ d@@ ined that many attacks went to the account of people having not appeared before in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects on asylum costs were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated kill@@ ers or followers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes alleged to have had nothing in the hat before with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left wing , which , however , have been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ as or world records in the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures anymore .
it disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a rate of 48 seconds ended its course and won the 5@@ 9th position of 59 star@@ ters .
it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians from the international swimming association had a special kind of law .
this is being distributed to make swimming in backward countries well known .
as in ae@@ dic@@ s the most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the grand race .
quickly , the first pointed name made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in touch to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he proposed only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , playing there no part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; comparisons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run was attracted by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters Fre@@ estyle alone .
fren@@ e@@ tic was made M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ guide will step down to dis@@ appoint business
the consumer research company Gf@@ K sw@@ ayed the head of Matthias Hart@@ mann .
but the res@@ ig@@ nations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K market research company had gu@@ essed that the chair of Executive Vice President Matthias Hart@@ mann was all the more uncertain , the more the successes have been promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nür@@ n@@ berger market research @-@ owned company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appoint business figures and reti@@ ring of the company leadership , the world &apos;s number five of the industry faces a personalized new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s head @-@ chief wants to leave the company for the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K @-@ supervisory board Ar@@ no Mah@@ m@@ ert has already begun with effect on 12 September from the supervisory body .
as early as September 1 , the management board of directors assumed the previous board member in Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , the company shared with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reason for the review , the company called &quot; differing views &quot; on long @-@ term business orientation .
details wanted a corporate spokes@@ person on Friday .
those who will continue to be the market research company in future is still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles , it was on Friday , in the shareholders , the latter have recently been a disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring of years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet visible after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the last bad non @-@ payment business , everyone will be inv@@ eig@@ ned at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case at BMW , it would also do the quot@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the second quarter of 2016 , the company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros the turnover amoun@@ ted by 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the previous year &apos;s figure .
compared to the first half of the year , sales tot@@ aling 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros increased by 3.4 per cent .
the profit in the second quarter has largely made the value of the company &apos;s reproduction in the face of its difficult economic situation .
at the Consumer Experience business in Consumer Experience , the company claims of 139 million Euros had consolidated the Group under the stroke of a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K had generated consolidated annual profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ces in cr@@ abs in dit@@ ch : 8 wounded
an accident of a coach with 43 seniors and passengers are injured on Thursday in Kru@@ k@@ hear@@ n ( county of Aur@@ i ) eight people .
two of the in@@ mates suffered grave injuries , the police have dealt with .
the 66 year old rider of the Bus@@ ses of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give their information according to a path of L@@ aster , partly driving on the road @-@ road .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people no longer leave the bus , &quot; she said .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a cle@@ ver@@ ages came to the accident on the national road 2 .
the untreated trav@@ eller were brought back by a public bus back to the Kru@@ k@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ heel .
there they should wait for a spare part of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck and possible witnesses to sign up with the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters waste is starting from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ k@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 so far ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 26 euros ) and to Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage charge will be improved once again if corresponding improvements are necessary .
after a non @-@ layer calculation , the se@@ wage rates in Az@@ endorf then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found during the approval of the budget through the Kul@@ mb@@ ach District , that for these se@@ wage systems under@@ mines .
the Casino Club is committed due to the legal principles to cover plants .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ ch bald , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must take deeper into the wal@@ let .
the lungs are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Board manager Herbert Schmidt was presented to the board , a re @-@ calculation of charges for the se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 - including over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the previous calculation period .
the engra@@ ver boo@@ ths founded Schmidt in order that it is with all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities with a very low san@@ itation of waste , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
because of the minimal basis for example , expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a grave impact .
in addition , wast@@ ew@@ ater is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
in the backward calendar period at all three systems not least , due to their age of san@@ ction and repair applications in a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for world lovers , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years .
Schmidt rejected that in the san@@ itation Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sh@@ k@@ ahl , the almost 20 year old conve@@ ying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and in the pond name Lop@@ p had to be established after nearly 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ ums@@ y possibility of order to be able to keep the water @-@ legal specifications in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued tut@@ oring and maintenance costs were taken into account according to the new calculation process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 are still considerably below the current level .
stone houses made clear that at the low waste water in the three systems the expenses for the operation and maintenance are &quot; fully prepared . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation for these systems will remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since you can &apos;t extend the care area of the se@@ wage system Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to extend these systems because it is a deficit of deficit .
Bulgaria first booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.@@ 2 % were posted .
the annual average stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0,@@ 8 % .
the price of the CP@@ I in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to dec@@ ember 2015 ) was -@@ 0,@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0,@@ 2 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as an Asian caricature .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this Filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is non@@ sensi@@ bly towards breeds .
with its filter tool it allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are und@@ ump@@ ous , self @-@ bloo@@ ded tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fish@@ ings per day .
all failures come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filter have drawn up criticism in the past that they have been accused of using the app Black@@ face muscles or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week caused a filter to some utensils , that gave them sle@@ w , wrong teeth and d@@ uns@@ wer@@ d che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caricature from Asi@@ atic - &quot; yellow sighted . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy is pointing to a greater problem that the company has its diversity .
the news and the indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat included that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caricature of Asian .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced Rot@@ is@@ sm , reminded the filter of breaking c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean American art student whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and eas@@ ed was unpleasant . &quot;
it added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not far @-@ sighted , but that the yel@@ lowing was removed to the decl@@ ining extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless seal and integration of integration , from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older counterparts - could likely be expecting to expect sen@@ sibility .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided , who works as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , and called for others to do the same .
in a essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that r@@ atory controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the introductory practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , just male leaders and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently focused on a human resource management that focuses on under@@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said in his turn , that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is OK . &quot;
military leadership on ISIS &apos; military service information , presents Committee of Congress
military co @-@ owned by the United States Central Command changed regulatory information to draw up an optimal image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual state of states in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can &apos;s republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces , Secret Services and the German Armed Forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , who reported how they changed their estim@@ ations to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , that controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news media information , which were typically in@@ geni@@ ous by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ es , signed a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allows the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article about the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the Represent@@ atives of Represent@@ atives .
leaders at Cent@@ Com are up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report clearly shows ab@@ iding problems during the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi army .
though there is no direct evidence that government tips given under Obama statements to change reports , it shows how the analysts exposed to the pressure of their supervis@@ ors , an optimal image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of the year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fixed the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com has announced that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 the leaders of the Central Command changed the jud@@ g@@ ative reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can sm@@ elling the Task Force into life after being played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by detailed findings while investigations will continue .
in addition , further investig@@ ations of Cent@@ Com reports are already underway by the general manager of the Ministry of Defence .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com also made an over@@ ly limited process for creating re@@ alis@@ tically estim@@ ations to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest level of democr@@ at was given as a member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ tar@@ ded the publication of Refle@@ ction reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ aming the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats said no indication of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts in regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particular political view &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in the last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the general manager of the Pentagon , which were received by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment reports of Congress , while investig@@ ational investigations are still ongoing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ting opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ative effects on the question of a successful aviation campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question to which President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret formations over the Islamic state remind of constraints of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about many analysts just looking forward to a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to provide guidance of government proposals against the refin@@ ing government proposed by the Islamic State won &apos;t have significant implications for the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries would have taken place in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command at Central Command . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK before
one day after having shed three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they cannot remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
yet they know that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equ@@ aled to their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last turn of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which both of the two teams will win their first and second place within their group .
the first plat@@ ter will take a little longer from the way that will lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they landed over the last London games on the last of 12 seats .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team all went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the National Team , and thus the things became better to use .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the rest of the rest .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the go@@ vern in the first half of the game with a return stop from the close range .
India had gone out to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprising and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the center , and swal@@ lowed the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are in@@ consistent and in@@ es@@ capable of doing a rapid rel@@ ay between competition and pursuit .
it &apos;s like the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a fl@@ aker st@@ ab , who is from the bracel@@ et to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete for the tri@@ athlete .
you cannot turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop , without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covers or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are also Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with gr@@ abs , would have quite been among these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time , rebuilt by sponsors and wellness @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even Fe@@ ar .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame does not illuminated any event any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air p@@ alle@@ y@@ ar@@ chery , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ swimming and may reign for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct the attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been an Olympic Debut 2000 , it was perceived the last 16 years so sp@@ aw@@ ful that many that I asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ type .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had had a athlete until 2012 , who made it up to the final .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans who are responsible for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain outdoor character , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ explained ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ age school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a rel@@ ed enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the charitable tre@@ mor of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that unites it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , yeast and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
according to the official Olympi@@ ad they are rated according to the design , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; air time . &quot;
two @-@ four athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete in Rio each other .
the common Olympic vector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists have to go on in their quest for gold faster , go up and down , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back , down and down on the playground .
you do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast another height : that of the world or the Olympi@@ are@@ kor@@ ds .
the pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I think about playing these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a moving movement is not the target .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an astronom@@ er , goes up , then effortlessly back up , then effortlessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without any difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no over@@ cast in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and end @-@ round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in Streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end of the end as part of a follow @-@ up area on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
amid the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , cute moment , one that is likely to overlook the general tum@@ ult .
if the appreciation of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes , as it recently presented the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his to air .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a fo@@ e of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstrators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , sti@@ ckers on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in she@@ aring .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
over the last ten years there was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months the protests against the government were shaken by the country , and they had more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses showed that polic@@ emen were shot on desper@@ ate prot@@ esters and killed .
in the revers@@ ed well @-@ being video about the protests , presumably from the last or beginning of this year , are showing how safety people beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and it will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , the dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the vast@@ ness of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a wide critici@@ zed election last year the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time the tensions continue along the border with Eritrea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den which were forced to take advantage of the turmoil in recent years and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of the ho@@ vering under the surface is now explo@@ ding .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially for protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies who conce@@ al where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave us that they were gathered for protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from e@@ dic@@ s to the predominantly Christian strongh@@ olds , in politics and the economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which make up approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who was able to think corners .
analysts say that he was particularly embarrassed to perceive the early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively in@@ sight@@ ful reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of North @-@ Ethiop@@ ian , comes Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time , that Ethiopia experienced such a revol@@ t in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which apparently fal@@ si@@ fied by the government , according to statements by analy@@ st .
during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it were less than in the last few months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as the new com@@ promis@@ ist , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is always more common in the social media .
analysts say the protests supported by the USA and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ger &apos;s trips on the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently changed that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want his allies to merge in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin one to walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp declares his claim to Obama with ISIS is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disper@@ se the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by announ@@ cing that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these clari@@ fications cast new questions about the communication skills of the presidential election data of the Republi@@ can public@@ ans , whether he would be able to communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his fellow @-@ workers who make every effort to take him during an eventful phase into protection , into the peculiar position , to explain statements which he could not have meant .
after having made the clear@@ ance of a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had returned to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can presidential guard wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism ha@@ un@@ ed to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he is trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign for dec@@ aying change on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again on Friday .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ically proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already submitted sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism when he said , Russians were supposed to h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ ically E@@ mails , but he explained later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to postp@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , how it will arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which is the language of both candidates .
but I think he is smart enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
instead of stres@@ sing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an even additional tone , as its re@@ fra@@ gment had continued to go back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a tour with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general tries to apologize for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements to dist@@ ort or his humour .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , great effort to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ war@@ bler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government was served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an out@@ minister , it ISIS permitted to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to crack down on each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he burnt the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats said about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once over@@ thrown over the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ itable café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been exp@@ elled .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in summer 2014 set , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native natives were as the last loss in a revers@@ ed city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ abs wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ store . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new discovery .
a revit@@ alised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has always some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , owner and managing director of new cafés .
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , stopped much with .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu stand sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are sh@@ acks like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
the cafe does not serve any beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months of Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a steady flow of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed by prizes of Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was one such customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , res@@ ided past in Williamsburg and visited the verb .
even after moving to Green@@ point , it would take the path to itself .
after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ leg , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was in the coffee and culture in the verb that I fell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing customer since the start of the verb .
he went there before work and ordered inv@@ ari@@ ably always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ ch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not notice Gro@@ ll that the soap has taken off the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ ery offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has made the menu translated into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he decided to put her back soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has additional advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb extends to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was pro@@ voc@@ ative and said that he was destroyed on the floor when the Café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the theme of the loc@@ als and the bar@@ k felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
his menu on this day was a modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ ums .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zie@@ gel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both gro@@ c@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while being told in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which is published on Tuesday in the Har@@ per publisher , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ving snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ O , 1929 .
Zie@@ gel@@ man , 54 , ordered a Fres@@ h@@ äs@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixing ate .
being the re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ ates ordered this , this was suitable for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said brick .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and sav@@ ory bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a slightly cheaper , which stre@@ ak the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years ahead of the Great Depression , the table was found in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ iled for male crops and it was served fresh baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans who sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; marks the ways in which the land turned to be no longer the s@@ acc@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as stra@@ ined was the new Bud@@ get@@ ter : mysterious food such as loaves and water @-@ lost were revit@@ alized , the K@@ asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful way , Es@@ sens@@ es@@ reste , &quot; noted Zie@@ gel@@ man , as chefs were able to hide @-@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a clou@@ ded sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry dry .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare and fourth luxury .
unique mi@@ xes were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has prec@@ e@@ dence over taste or even healthy chef .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick , goat made a dish from that era , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition on the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zie@@ gel@@ mann carries out on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the home@@ op@@ recipes .
as never before or since , the bud@@ get@@ ary economy - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the food habits of the country like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical dis@@ d@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ house kitchen in his kitchen , he feeds like the millions of millions of world in which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental kitchen as fish with cu@@ cum@@ en@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ anor had called him to stat@@ u@@ ge with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper had no interest in flavours with MS Roo@@ sev@@ elt that the White House made the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most sav@@ ory prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said goat , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave thanks to writing the book eating habits of Zie@@ gel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law to have understood better - for example , how they could not throw food off .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zie@@ gel@@ man remembered , &quot; She made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ y incident .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they departed and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um of Roo@@ sev@@ elt &apos;s President of Roo@@ sev@@ elt &apos;s lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes to send another name .
there was no curved cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone turns out somewhat reluct@@ antly to have a spoon into the ten@@ acious , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ e took three times a post@@ pon@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the play to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the Hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a façade attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which has saved lives according to the picture @-@ newspaper , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 0.000 people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives in the play to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbolic figure in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attack in Syria .
the helicopter have dropped four stor@@ bombs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb so that no children are playing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; c@@ ites the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly paraly@@ sis of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland often only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland was only getting up with 150 years of offspring .
leis@@ ur@@ ely flo@@ ats of Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is at an average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it comes to climb@@ s , the five metre long shot up to the sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a ro@@ be .
this one of long @-@ bloo@@ ded lifestyle might seem to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; madness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span that means a world ord for verteb@@ rates .
admittedly the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland become a rocky one .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees , they usually dive on the surface mostly only in winter .
researchers about the li@@ festyles of Greenland know researchers correspon@@ d@@ ingly little .
their time @-@ motion emp@@ athy , they , when they started out of Spit@@ s@@ bergen six animals with a transm@@ itter @-@ stat@@ or .
loot these shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remn@@ ants of a ro@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw of a young ice @-@ bear .
possibly hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look at Kad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ etres long , whereas the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres long .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the ruler of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which in it there are no longer re@@ done in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ tia .
her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear @-@ weapon @-@ attempts , larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon carbon into the atmosphere .
in which with 220 centimeters length , the smallest animal contained in contrast a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland had in their lenses on the other hand normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ etres long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only then get off when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers could assign a age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 15@@ 6 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication was obviously at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Green@@ land@@ wal , in which sp@@ eck put on the neck at the neck @-@ neck at the neck @-@ tip , was captured in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures there is often the organism living there on austerity .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal acqu@@ ires heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives thus more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal should deal with it rather than investing their resources in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sub@@ strate in double @-@ pack
with topics around the building , the municipal council has focused at the recent meeting point .
with relief the Panel , the Communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz took up that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently published housing models can begin . &quot;
having clarified the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and surveys and the applications submitted for measurement , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der straße - construction section 1 ) is nothing more interested in those interested parties .
the com@@ der@@ ate is convinced that the bun@@ ks are in rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and other elderly alike .
as it was said , building users can report immediately in the town hall , about the allocation of plots will be advised to advise the com@@ der@@ at in its September session .
to also request requests to the relocation of further industrial companies , associated with the creation of jobs , to be able to change the Common Market , which was to re@@ vert the decline of space in part in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of sub @-@ time , there is already a designated commercial area in the direction of two plots in direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best opportunities to move from London to reloc@@ ate jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , head of competence financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether it is allowed to continue to run money from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it has so far been granted approval in the United Kingdom .
these are just great US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main last five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , speaking the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other major authorities , such as the European Insurance Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has a large fund industry , cutting it just as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
furthermore , the city with slightly available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not that easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands .
at the Seine are also the rents for top @-@ class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Merc@@ er , the city stood at No. 7 , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Luxembourg on No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; then the I@@ W ref@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London is going to remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit &apos;s major financial centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also speak the power relations : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead will receive legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent @-@ it with Mer@@ ck
an American official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs resulting from the he@@ pat@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released from a credit card payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million to the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , following the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni by Gilead , after a US judges covered a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including the opinion of expression and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the complaint of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. ministries said to Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead has no claim at the expense of the cost , which were created during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to pull out Gilead that dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicine that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck meet each other def@@ endant and property of laboratory work , of which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir zu@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

clinics earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton has published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , these revealed for the presidential election of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Swiss tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons USD 1 Million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ically &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his hel@@ pers for the last ten years .
you paid an effective Swiss tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klinik Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a cr@@ itting opposite , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false statements and reg@@ isters in relation to its previous promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions .
it is custom@@ ary to publish their tax declaration for US presidential data , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as the reason for its denial , a tax examination by tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics electoral campa@@ igning in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to post something before the tax inspec@@ tors did not complete .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can Presidential Agency of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have announced that his ref@@ usal questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business res@@ ists and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already kno@@ cked on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking re@@ public@@ ans of Tru@@ mp and publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject of a speech about the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential election has done in recent decades and to publish its tax schemes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid for two years or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times announced on Friday a number of tax evasion and tax advis@@ ors that may still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in an election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett to ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal as well .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate asked here its seat , Tru@@ mp for a meeting on their tax expl@@ ants .
Buff@@ ett said that he has been subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &apos;s &quot; fear &quot; in front of voters and not against tax authorities .
Clin@@ ically Camp@@ a@@ ign &quot; campaign has recently published its tax return to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Swiss tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the United Kingdom &apos;s tax return to 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of its income as wage @-@ wage referred to as wage , unlike most of all Americans .
its chief scope of funds was a cost @-@ effective index Fund , for which the Clin@@ tons dividend and income are controlled by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ men and dance @-@ ani@@ as eleph@@ ants
Natur@@ environ@@ s in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being lived in people - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea ahead of years , together with the U.S. nature conservation , has trained their support by working volunteers in the north of Tanzania , a non@@ violent qu@@ itting method to protect their homes and harvest without destroying animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend oneself .
Friday is a phone dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe in this communities a change of their attitude , being much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants of their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; vo@@ iced the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a Communication .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ate of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not de@@ ported , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der @-@ mix with earth is wrapped together with a fire@@ works cor@@ ded in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion is only rot@@ ated .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a kno@@ b and spra@@ ying fine dust to chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air .
a hint quite generally already out to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
a last chance represents a value , which sho@@ ots a lab@@ ur@@ izing work in the air and thereby creates a loud , light explosion .
church decides in unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ os@@ k@@ building on the St. Go@@ al Rhein@@ u@@ fer

the request for the new construction of a sales ski@@ os@@ ks am Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s building , however , came into effect at the beginning of the construction of the Rhine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in exp@@ on@@ ated situation at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots en@@ gros@@ sed a media watch , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli pre @-@ election as it would have challenged Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; allowed his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how did it happen in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i has a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel said that the measure will be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it , the director stood still more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became the employee of Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and were troubled .
this is indeed very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has occurred in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident prov@@ oked a rather big resonance on the Internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in another article , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly drew all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disc@@ ern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct assignment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Israel did not enter the quick @-@ down list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the South German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country election has now been added .

the police set lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ overs against the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began , as police officers tried to pres@@ cribe the students , which led to the police rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
according to the Govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading division between Moscow and Tehran in the year comparison with 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly to businesses in the country , the amb@@ ass@@ adors shared .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade @-@ building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading volume between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and un@@ le@@ ased $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the recovery was reached by deliveries of machinery , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes back to Russia for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year Russian foreign representatives were around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , first and foremost travel ev@@ is@@ as , of Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran finished the top 20 countries which concerns the economy number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

the Min@@ ist@@ rants from the past@@ oral care unit E@@ il@@ tal Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna was on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages have been tac@@ kled .
in order to exceed the time up to the next Rom@@ s@@ wir@@ ing of all Min@@ ist@@ rants over two years , the upper min@@ ist@@ ran@@ ged round St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a several @-@ day pilgrimage .
several pilgrimage targets has been tested and it was finally decided for the bish@@ ops city of Freiburg , where during this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy on the occasion of the mercy of mercy on the Frei@@ burger Münster , was offered a special pilgrimage goal .
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ a bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern made their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and told the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from Hor@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hor@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was driven by rail to the starting point in Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster of Bel@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ ms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came away from the town of Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the individual day@@ trips were wor@@ shipped in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner threw at home , as Br@@ ite Gold for Rad@@ sport .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the landing role , which was made by Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proudly , when he fell at home to make a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England has claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
they repeated the trick after it took place in March at the railway world cup in London despite the back@@ end Ho@@ ys , just one modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Jamie staff .
they did this in time as instructions .
Ho@@ ppies leave a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained , when they saw potential in the car@@ rots which un@@ folds her .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - which won four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner continued to the qualification round a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord , but in the still@@ ness , the New Zealand wins the New Round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
immediately after his turn left , but Kenn@@ y got the team forward and Sk@@ inner did it .
a strategic change made a large part of the transformation that was going to slow down in a higher gear to slow him down and make it con@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they got on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have been nominated for the Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys there was Hin@@ der that he dropped off after a weak start on the train .
he moved this statement later and there was no objection of England Riv@@ als .
there was no such problem for this time with such a victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole GB of flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were obtained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of con@@ domini@@ um , it is in the field of possible that he repeatedly repeated the victory of three Olympic medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the skir@@ t of the Ho@@ y alike .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always at best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely and alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the Knight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ard competition of the day but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter races .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the destination .
the world record , which won in 2012 in London was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) are taking place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins is certainly in focus .
he had taken up yesterday with notice before the qualifications , when he called upon him to measure his body size .
in the course of the women &apos;s competition , which will continue and ended , av@@ owed Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ pelago , soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in world cup time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong track team to dominate the average period of the Olympic Games and to fetch a shot at medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio fell down .
drama &apos;s drama in the background , leaving the resignation of the technical guidance Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and har@@ rows and retirement from sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
however , if one sees himself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary call GB@@ s , which at the perfect moment has reached its climax again to be repeated again .
future of the melting away from Portland due to the lifting of the end @-@ to @-@ day transport
the future of aluminium sm@@ el@@ mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake as the system operator will cancel the energy supplier and thus raise all delivery contracts , such as the delivered energy companies included .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
one for 20 years sub@@ missions exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could occur to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting units consumed around 10 percent of total electricity production Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the point of Henry melting away , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melting away from Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ed a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplied the large aluminium carp@@ enters with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is in the predomin@@ ance of a joint venture of the Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p can hold smaller percent@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means more physical demand for electricity through m@@ elt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the company with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the treaties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he@@ dging operations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month suspension period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the agreements in the fiscal year 17 will be contributing to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong stock markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L told the value of the agreements already written in his annual h@@ ack@@ us in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to pay the agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate or ensure the power supply to the melting away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not com@@ promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 @-@ year treaty with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have to come into effect from November this year , even if there is still an explanation guilty of why it came back from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic relations of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland &apos;s m@@ elt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is using around 600 me@@ gawatts each year and Tom@@ ago , about 900 me@@ gawatts of electricity .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ n@@ hi@@ an reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ em@@ ber@@ th of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers to crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , ges@@ tic@@ ated reality video that ends the entire car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem of ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ lyn ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends with a classical twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this presents the cl@@ is@@ che@@ es@@ che@@ ated action almost every birthday period of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ ulture brought the sentence , &quot; You forgot that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the honesty of a animations on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in their other girls somehow in this publicity .
with a view to the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th of Vo@@ gue , there is certainly a new era of the Kar@@ vi@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim like she , what the Vo@@ gue cover comes , beaten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September @-@ edition of the magazine is a League for himself .
the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th of September is the most profitable edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a girth which resembles rather a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output sets a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unvei@@ ling of his co@@ ver@@ star is expected as un@@ selfish , that in the last two years images of the journal desc@@ ended before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ istr@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - in the past category , it is in good company .
these celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
these are truly talented women , who are distinguished in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers like success not everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the fashion world .
in June he critici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the gau@@ ge of the moment . &quot;
these feelings blend again high , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the cont@@ entment , it seems to be passing by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the sep@@ em@@ ber@@ th of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your gr@@ ation of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all of her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold out of her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in the Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community service centres over 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 in the countries of the country will be rejected annually by the Council of agencies , whereas the industry has already taken an impact on the effects of further medium @-@ cut transactions .
in Queensland there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ inations and similar have - when searching for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the Joint Center of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Meeting was revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ si said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land &apos;s common centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are of important services that you will need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with un@@ manage@@ able and op@@ pressive debts , families that have been dischar@@ ged by divi@@ ding workers , workers who have been dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal fashion and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the federal government will cut by 30 percent since June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people need to be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any help .
we demand the General Secretary General and the federal government , as well as the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these mi@@ tig@@ ations , so people get the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the federal government fulfilled their commitment to lift funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community service centres and their customer communities , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Elec@@ tions accused of having allegedly gun fir@@ ing
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action after having been informed that their campaign manager for North Carolina in February had a shot on a staff while they were travelling in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in a indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the Landes@@ Tribunal of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ coordinates was waiting for months to have waited for months that the matter would be controlled internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a p@@ istol , placed his right foref@@ inger on the de@@ duction , and r@@ ammed the run into Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ coordinates in his indictment .
after he compl@@ ained on local and regional campaign management , B@@ coordinates made sure that at least four other people had made the same experience with Phillip , he was in the indictment .
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up .
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential election , a turmoil in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ sion @-@ owner and weapon @-@ dogs - measures should take action in case of his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton to be elected and judge should appoint .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was clear that media had torn away his words from the context and that he would not be con@@ ned to violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compens@@ atory damages from the campaign for violation of due di@@ ligence obligations and from Philip due to body breaking and ab@@ iding mental damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pres@@ ent@@ pre@@ ver in Hope Hi@@ cks was not reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phillip is no longer co @-@ worker of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
at the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( 18 . September ) are significant losses for government parties ( SPD ) and CD@@ U .
this took place representative surveys of the opinion research institutions IN@@ SA for the &quot; image &quot; -@@ newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition in the north still persist , this is not possible after the review in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue to government the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw the SPD of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent , five years ago at 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party b@@ lasted just shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the Left Opposition at 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent with 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , in spite of heavy losses .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
in Berlin , the survey of the survey , the SPD led the survey only to 23 percent ( by 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
by doing so , you still sm@@ elled behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ten@@ haus .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirate would against it in contrast to 2011 miss the one .
Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and internet in time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its producer has experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather big .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight me@@ gab@@ yte , which would reach today for about two sel@@ fish@@ ers with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with a minimum of 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator &quot; was launched just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros enthusiasts can still buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow from the stone @-@ time of the inter@@ net@@ age .
however , 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the computer fair at CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western @-@ format &quot; format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser , albeit qu@@ el@@ ly slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked out similar to a laptop .
then there is a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euros .
nobody could have imagined in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and closed .
the market today dominate suppliers that came all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today a lot of people today .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
these are the well running shops of the numer@@ ical App @-@ providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone has since grown a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market arrived at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet @-@ communication , all accessible via touch screen .
the success of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the after@@ math .
it disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ w now have Apple and Asian vend@@ or like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention , a matter of course .
the average is now 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to go away the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , the Siemens Board of Directors for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only going to be present in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country for renewal and prosperity .
for me that was the biggest attraction He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we were running a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will get back by creating new opportunities for loc@@ alities and companies in the vicinity of He@@ a@@ throw new opportunities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will have already 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips that create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big .
I was told that England has never been prepared for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage .
the bi@@ f@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to rec@@ ede , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not one infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both for the airport and in whole GB .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , was built up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented lear@@ ners of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which will be supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the 2012 London Olympics were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw will also be one of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we will direct this olymp@@ ic mind and expand He@@ a@@ throw and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocks
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to byp@@ ass ad block , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; equal .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad loos@@ ening on its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook dealt with , that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding for its advertisements in order to detect it display lock@@ ings on which part of the page advertising is to make difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that there has found a new way to byp@@ ass the new code .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ struggle between the an@@ un@@ ed Open Source community and the byp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has entered the battle is a strong clu@@ es to become a worrying indicator of the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people display le@@ vel@@ ier ; almost four times so much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand @-@ consuming 84 percent of the advertising took Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has it on ad block on desktop PCs apart from the mobile ad block . he has no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a spokes@@ man with .
advertising on desktop PCs is making a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook does the investment of such a pac@@ em@@ aker appears as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook dealt with , that it would update its &quot; ad prepar@@ edness &quot; to bring people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ bloc would make new filters worrying , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; for users this does not represent a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ man by Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people .
woman by suspected self @-@ su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was transferred on Thursday during a suspected self @-@ su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a ran@@ ger at the age of 49 years , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , was wanted to kill themselves .
she died on the spot .
several drivers were already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident to sign up .
it was opened in an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the pro@@ secutor has to decide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person ran on the free@@ way - was decided that the driver did not assume that a pedestrian was running in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the driving force was acqu@@ itted of charge after having survived a man and killed that in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drank and has become unconscious at the road , he took the judgment .
the Court held that the police officer -- which had responded to a call -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident occurring on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was most likely to be inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once again .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow upheav@@ al of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , inherited similar atmosphere and still pers@@ isted .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet thought probably more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect life more rapidly ev@@ ap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow upheav@@ al of Venus their daily side of the Sun is nearly two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io , in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which looks like a Um@@ br@@ ella , to prevent the surface from a large proportion of the sun@@ bed .
the result are average temperatures that some degree co@@ ols than the Earth today are .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research .
although it was formerly inhabited , the Venus -- in the course of several billions years , exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
its oceans are bl@@ amed and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate @-@ model in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy appears as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a small contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have filled my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado , with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; commented by the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
I &apos;ve been thinking about how long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth to give it more depth , and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he also has to have some decision on decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who agreed to Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked his contributions to his team .
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has received his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the description signed in the 2015 @-@ 16 season announced a 39 @-@ 39 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ ino , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks again , strike strings from
the labour struggles for the remuner@@ ation for North @-@ East workers are exposed , while all armed forces for a new conversation took place on the table , they said .
strikes against the oil field service provider timber Group were conducted spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ite unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some full @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks , which will begin the beginning of next year to address the problems again .
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group donated this year to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the short@@ cut of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to get through the market swing .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alised its business activities as a result of its me@@ gaz@@ ing cooperation with the BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower raw oil prices , an economic situation , which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest work issues , which have been taking place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation of stars in the star @-@ pile of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler &apos;s tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ations among the stars of the star @-@ raising of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star @-@ pile of different ru@@ bies , as well as in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary development .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the ple@@ j@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation were created about 125 million years ago , now adul@@ thood now reach adul@@ thood .
it is now turning at the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ations , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars encounter great amounts of ast@@ er@@ winds .
since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star alternate , his rotation begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star -- such as sun@@ spots -- re@@ jects .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ary rates indicates that massive stars are more slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ets turn as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the ple@@ j@@ ads we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star @-@ pile of the ple@@ j@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates .
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Re@@ ull said .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , how , W@@ ann and why stars slow their rot@@ ations and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues in three newspaper articles report in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star emerges
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional response announcement , the 41 years old professional will carry against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a tenth year contract had been providing 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he serves as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez acquired a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to make some milestones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but in the glory hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old could not be recorded .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is its appearance outside of the square .
in 2009 , the super@@ star gave to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have lost stero@@ ids .
in August 2013 , he was arrested for 211 games due to a completion in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis @-@ sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main suspi@@ cious , for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 because I have performed 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his departure @-@ days do not go no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends get even the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job contains the attempt to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress Kate Hudson , sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ rival@@ ry Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; s@@ aves the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ en@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive con@@ fession of dop@@ ing , wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio did not start .
Rio de Janeiro - Rio 2016 Olympic Games are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an enligh@@ tened athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day before the seventh day before the Olympic Games have become famous for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacles Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil in a positive way and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the anyway critical le@@ ak competitions , these messages come to the un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was established last Sunday , which is used as the mas@@ tic means for dop@@ ing sub@@ instances .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have allowed to participate in the procedures over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation in investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio sick@@ ened the message over the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went by itself into offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; This is an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the corpor@@ e@@ ta@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act with the substance of the substance of the blood @-@ dop@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample would have been very positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov came to word immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ lon news .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
in this way , approximately all weights may not be part of the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation in Rio .
on Friday also the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympics was tested in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was previously tested positive on the an@@ abo@@ lic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ lon .
both can ride the intake , however both may not start in the class until 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics case , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another severe blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World verband IA@@ AF had allowed the complete Russian team to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing in the start , even the L@@ ill@@ ess Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming pool , the previous verses in China had also taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t gave the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ an Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ le li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I will commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun was also at the center of a dispute with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese Championships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but had to sit only a three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock .
Dat@@ k@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de presses her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mailing @-@ mal@@ ware are currently targe@@ ting company - and are successful in doing so .
according to a current survey of Mal@@ ware &apos;s specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ smith software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims are willingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators are specialised their black@@ smith software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes with attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to er@@ ase ran@@ som fall significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then , the perpetrators discovered creation software for itself .
only did private users were the goal , but the change towards company attacks was frigh@@ tening quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she is looking for un@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ting the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ sors .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of cryp@@ tic Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are using the personal photo database on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is tac@@ kled .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of the affected German firms surve@@ yed by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to under@@ break the business completely , in case of a case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are saying the victims always : pays not , you just promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure the utility properties and the contact with black@@ mail@@ ers examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they express their sacrific@@ es via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access @-@ accessible support websites or un@@ en@@ code for example files .
and will redeem individuals after payments of a few hund@@ red@@ th euro , businesses have to partly negotiate harsh and five @-@ digit tot@@ als to return their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk income from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains security expert Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , is that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their pollut@@ ants in the form of a software building to the actual pres@@ criptions .
the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the Mal@@ ware himself , consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ smith will then look for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one log@@ ins in one of the forums on the underground , buys the set of criminals and assigned a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ calcul@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually , the criminals carry the sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known in many companies providing their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT @-@ leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ .com .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful er@@ ess@@ ation more , thre@@ aten the perpetrators with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes damage to the type of data still a few times higher than before .
even the perpetrators of the perpetrators could be taking completely new goals in the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers as they could get control of using the Internet of linked thermo@@ stat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter , the activ@@ ist of such a blocking heating could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future can block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will put everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sound quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling apart .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a suitcase set by 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l in the opposite back arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical , as it sounds : the seats of the spine can be cl@@ amped like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk area can be well loaded , however the loading height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,@@ 6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 PS acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ range areas very powerful .
he should do a little qui@@ eter for his work .

there is still another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the bicycle behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment can be made in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled .
among the safety systems the City @-@ Not@@ with@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works until speed 32 ) , the collision system and the gap @-@ resistant .
the collision is sometimes irrit@@ ated , because it assessed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ bi@@ er@@ ous objects . &quot;
very reliable works from the tel@@ esc@@ ope .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ e@@ gler is responding to the speed detection and d@@ ros@@ y when needed the speed .
the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , app @-@ integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat awkward .
the around 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
who does not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engines of 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .
for the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a multi@@ faceted and everyday @-@ sharing car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ hau@@ ling on air @-@ bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the air bridge .

the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee rests with the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease : when paid by the organizer
dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers after their trip only then money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests will be proven to show the same symptoms .
in the same case , a family was severe due to diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
it almost spent the entire holiday in the room .
their disease resulted in the vac@@ ation@@ ers on a broken se@@ wage plant that supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey was therefore in@@ consistent - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ lage was broken .
but the promot@@ er only drove just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of it .
he had to assume that the sea water was in order .
he did not hurt his information duties , so the judgement .
especially since in the samples of the water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belong to the general life risk .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , according to the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had concerns about further attacks .
the state must have had and decided to respond to terror at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triumph@@ ant triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
if criminal offen@@ ders would have to leave the country , the level of safety and strength is also the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a set of proposals until the election of the election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ length order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be again under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , which can be re@@ acted by the arms , especially the purchase of weapons on the internet .
the last much discussed still@@ s for doctors should remain protected following de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a view to mental symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to be used in stric@@ ter investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior ministers have made clear against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was a ear@@ chers for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ishing double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of enforcement officers will be un@@ problematic for constitu@@ tionally problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot stop everything that one re@@ jects , and I refused to carry the bur@@ ka .
can be talked about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the Minister before , he wants to sim@@ ulate his new anti @-@ terror package and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ left party of Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ ars and a tigh@@ tening of the right to turn the people in this country not greater security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway exit
there is a regular basis on the byp@@ assing road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
however , this should change : the relief is to be extended .
that is good news for all the car of motor@@ cyclists who are standing in the field of professional traffic on the ambient road every night at the jam , when they travel through the highway of the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road building is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit of Wes@@ el , the right track by 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then get directly from the Hammer Street on the right .
the major advantage : the traffic shares early on , whereby the overall number of steps on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the driving train at the Zu@@ br@@ inger is we@@ ather@@ ed the motor@@ ists mainly between 17 and 7 pm .
week@@ days reaches back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h route and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the exit of Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic is guided only one @-@ lane via the motorway .
the second track had to be built just about three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no longer the required hydro@@ power to accommodate above all the heavy traffic @-@ tracks .
as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks and the associated stan@@ au will not last , the competent authorities cannot say .
however , it is possible to reck@@ on with years : for the bridge has an official remainder of time until the year 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the national company has chosen the traffic @-@ weak@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and on Wednesday one @-@ lane on the job@@ site .
intercultural journey : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &quot; The invisible House . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ated &quot; intercultural travel &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the staging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association offers to visit the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people in the class are from September 2015 to March 2016 , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and would say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ ic images and video animations , it has been possible to follow the course of action , nevertheless follow the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Society , founded by Dr. Christ@@ ma@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg , and the Young Theatre will cooperate in the upcoming season within a musical theatre project .
from October to December , youth with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will get the opportunity to visit professional guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatri@@ cal and theatri@@ cal language teaching are available in the planning stage .
the project &quot; intercultural travel &quot; continues .
given the Ascen@@ ded refugee figures , the association is counting on many classes which want to participate .
rain instead of star @-@ cutting : hope for we@@ ather@@ ing
the weather has made the observatory Gu@@ ck@@ ling Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the South@@ west of Germany at night for Friday to be a St@@ ay by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night is not suitable for clouds and rain , to observe the sky spectacle , said the chair of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good then we certainly see many star @-@ cut@@ ters at the sky .
the star@@ ters is per@@ sei@@ zing which belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star mark@@ ups .
they have their names because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening one rolled up etern@@ ally , at night you are awake in the morning , in the morning it is far from the W@@ ec@@ ker@@ kl@@ ing@@ es no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep , and over ten percent experience their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different causes under@@ lie , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ din , board member of the German Society for Schlaf@@ es and Schlaf@@ es .
what you understand is , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so a inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y @-@ compul@@ sive disorder .
just that perme@@ ating many people experience as uns@@ atis@@ fying or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member in the German house medical association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep @-@ dys@@ functions ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it can organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rare is the sleeping @-@ compul@@ sive disorder of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is frequent in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that various factors are op@@ pressing together .
those , for example , has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , guarded every two to three hours and blur@@ ry to greet more about everyday problems and care , gives vast@@ ly an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one go to a doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who are not well sleeps about a period of a month in at least three nights per week and if the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , av@@ ed them .
the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods fluctu@@ ations or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ oral patterns occur , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also drugs - classic bed@@ bugs only in exceptional cases and most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; low @-@ time sleep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany hardly , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore one should look at sleeping problems initially at the veterin@@ arian , pu@@ zz@@ ling .
this can determine if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for an examination in the sleeping laboratory medicine , for example , with snoring with respiratory suffer@@ ings , with disease @-@ fatigue , at bed@@ bugs , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , fi@@ etze explains .
actually , one does not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , one goes to his normal time in bed .
besides the electro@@ des in the body you have a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap , and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger .
in addition , a camera is shown at the ceiling of the sleeping .
how do you find the problems that you can get a grip on ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which one can put for a better sleep .
vast@@ ly counts on : regular bed@@ time and up @-@ times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , alcohol , and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s all and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed themselves with Facebook to dis@@ appoint over@@ cutting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he made gold for the first time in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook protected against his role in the cri@@ es ex @-@ team members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where the Olympi@@ asi@@ vi@@ ger gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not work exactly on the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do it even operate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , then D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be signed nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( Nada ) .
that is how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent Contro@@ llers of W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; demands the choice of ham@@ bur@@ gers , who now operates a Eis@@ di@@ ele .
airport : ban@@ de of bags arrest
professional Die@@ be at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Düssel@@ dor@@ fer polic@@ emen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed as ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ - and pan@@ di@@ ps .
against 21.@@ 30 pm recognised civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang back , which was known by the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid July of this year and were in a collaborative effort and particularly professional .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mes Pro@@ ari@@ ats 34 may have entered the seal , which has entered the disposal of criminal off@@ ences according to Germany , four deeds .
they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
Alt@@ constructions , a few lime trees , in the meantime by still a remainder of the cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in effect does not affect the first glance , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one arrives at slots , a fres@@ hen nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the façade of a gray house , someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ d@@ l , which should also be demol@@ ished , will already be built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the responsible property company Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in calls , will be preferred by burning cars over the past few weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants of rental agreements , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
in the beginning of the year Hen@@ kel , especially the Berlin inside of the year had been declared a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy .
after on June 22nd the rooms were evacu@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmie@@ de , with 300 police officers , repor@@ tedly pat@@ rolling the police three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team racing cars on site , blocking parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , building construction work on behalf of the un@@ known land@@ owners the rooms .
on July 13 , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents stro@@ lling with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left violence is not the main inhabitants of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who stood here three children , are mainly built by the police force .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects they share the care of rising rents and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a pine , who wanted to make himself predominantly political ple@@ dge in front of v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior and the police are open between domestic and their neighbours , obviously not exist .
Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also compared to the rest of the city a low average and a high poverty risk .
also houses and those born @-@ born projects have long been a max@@ im : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated at a large police station in a controlled street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and were still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral lin@@ ers from around the world : with them the inhabitants of the GDR and former household occupied its jaw .
this also presents itself with the rents , which has risen since 2009 by nearly 60 percent in 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you recognize them at wor@@ shipped sli@@ ces or freshly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades , which were car@@ ded with color beut@@ lern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason is that not all neighbours might regard this as a problem , it might not necessarily be affected by the crime : off@@ ences such as body breaking , statistics reveal almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make kind of damage , which tends to be rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , there may be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is subtle : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , which certainly did not have been .
even the famous burning cars do not pass it directly in the rig .
for the studied architect , their road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary , &quot; here one helps to each other , lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the Riga Street - and remained .
that is why it was also so important that the inhabitants gained their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claims the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of dwell@@ ers such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to take away : through the un@@ obstruc@@ ted new@@ buildings in former building gaps , which thr@@ ong the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately proprietary apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I do absolutely no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never dies ?
there is a frustration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for dis@@ car@@ ving who affection@@ ate themselves about color @-@ bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
those who run , should be aware of this - just like someone who attracts a bar in a pub that can complain about noise there .
all persons reserved only with previous names are asked to be called on with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is the contact for participation in terms of integration and organizer .
furthermore , she is a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , refugee camps , refugee , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine client of the working class indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , the ei@@ gh W@@ oll@@ y sau , which above all have a problem .
thus , some - less spot@@ ted than rather pointed to the multitude of challenges we desire - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
she was looking for a administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a comprehensive W@@ oll@@ li@@ sau .
yet administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le .
most of all it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network connection .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on the occasion of three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le hon@@ orable and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and insur@@ rec@@ ess problems .
soon new containers stand in the washing road
a serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the connection @-@ controls , which have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting .
you must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented apartment spaces .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself .
the responsibility changes from the state office to the Comm@@ une and the Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
to date , it does not work so far , that one is dependent on private homes , so Deu@@ ter@@ ies .
therefore , common apartments must be as@@ certain@@ ed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keywords , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le .
apart from a fixed base , there are tra@@ ine@@ ers , training places , education places , one @-@ euro @-@ jobs and export activities for refugees and migrants who must be j@@ umped up or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive margin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
occupation , however , does not just mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a coher@@ ent feeling .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also to jump here managing and volunteer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to declare the refugees that it just takes and they can make time sensible , for example with language courses .
those who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , which will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but problems are also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer is therefore always interested to motivate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is all a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the most recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some are naive to call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a waste risk and wants to close them out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ pers already .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ination attempt to put them entirely in recall .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with this , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must be held on site and in the region to activities .
they are always in the background that soon a new peak of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question is clear to answer , sc@@ rap the politics .
actually , it is unfair to place them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived , where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le said .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are also busy even so that the previous human beings are reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are unanim@@ ous .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ters for
