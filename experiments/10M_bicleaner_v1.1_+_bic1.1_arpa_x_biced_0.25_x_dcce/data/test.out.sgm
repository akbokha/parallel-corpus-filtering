<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf course in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with a horse ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament winners - close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left himself with his family over the plant of the RV RV, on a horse he did not use any time for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen, and thus also the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports work handed over the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden SportPyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no doubt that he lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesenser kreuz, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - this want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential elections are in control and energy policy as well as in primary demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state, of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to hold the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and to be regulated to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different to the fact that Trump is holding.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively increase regulations and will power for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton is saying, the state has given certain duties to open a disadvantage and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Into the must be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So in Trump there could be even more in-party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and go down again the coal promotion in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton on the other hand wants to expand renewable energies with their investment programme," "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, they both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both of us want to isolate the US from international trade but simply protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">These are to be paid better then, asks for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage from 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase her to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump stands, who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to it, so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who believe that the end as soon as they ankar in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, women in refugees would often be regarded as inferior and worst if abused.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "Alliance of Foreign Relations" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to preach an official end to the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter-players in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot fend up to Ankara that Ankara wants that reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the envelope, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles were muddy, and he barely lit up heat, even for his back-directed circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan is repeatedly speaking of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day he described a newspaper that Erdogan was so bented as if there were never anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed to give me the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cool show that the President of Russia had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his leadership: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in their backs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The verb was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the capping again becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations of senior officials from the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria could have benefited from the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire are clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed for all friends who he can get after finishing last month with a failed coup d'er almost his Amtes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the television television cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in vdemosti forms it like:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West since its response to the trying to take power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued Groll come across the snow-accession of the EU accession talks and Putin - the piping to draw benefits from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian president in Ankara won a bonus to Ankara that he called for government officials after trying to support the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow a matter of fact, which itself has changed a deeper fear of regime.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this gloss palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one that once described me a analyst, "Alliance of Foreign Relations": two countries that have rejected and badly treated by the West and are now turning ill.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role of a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support conflicting sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, both President on the press conference said that they would not have striped the subject once more.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately postponed a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member against Russia's Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads at least talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently released his staff leader Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the closest trust of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Trademarks and Transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin without giving reasons, "the dismissal of Ivanov sets out his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been deputy secretary since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the prestigious stately Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it says (in Russian) that he later was a log chief and the executive director of the governing staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state chief of law enforcement and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday with that Ivanov asked for it to leave his posts and have recommended Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin's and works like it for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin that has been broadcast on television, both men claimed that the staff chief came back on his own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are only few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one who knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man, who was once touted as a potential president, at once the Russian environmental policy wants to lead - came across large scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks by Putin, who quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining about four years of age.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the state-security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who created the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin got in power he called Ivanov as one of five guys, whom he trusted in the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia in the second term, as a third presidential coup in violation of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies coup, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "economic Minister Keith Brown declared a visit to the building site today and was one of the first who went to the bridge from the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Southern French crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineer from a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the drawing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of nearly 79% of the total roses at its place and the last section of Decks gets a betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first decision marks a significant milestone in each of the bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project marks the end of the trendsetting of trendsetting and deep-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road cap and its connection with the northwest of the northturmdeck, we had to shut down the still existing gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, approximately 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of approx. 3% had to be moved upwards.</seg>

<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD Group Leader by Christoph Bratmann believes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will in future be able to show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be developed in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing program, which will cost millions of costs and must be financed.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement between the political groups" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left seeks even more hardness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what viola, viola is a tightening of the situation on the residential market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we are getting the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the programme is not yet complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built in any case.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does one like the loss of other about 1300-priced apartments, whose funding will be expired in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments up to 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning political speaker in Nicole Palm, should now purchase ongoing ties from the city now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to get apartments back to the pricing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">One fell swoop to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Weststadt dates back to the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments can be returned there in the price of affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners, the construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">The number of social flats in the West stadt will dramatically increase dramatically away from the goal of the so-called intermingling.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in just a few districts should not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be no movement in discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child does not go outside outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time spending, on monitors, has been in the last decade of many beaks.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to it, of course, on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters who were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later originated from it an animated series, game cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of the pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that the servers oversized.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players are going to go outside with their smartphone and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "" "" photographed "" "" (over a screenshot on the mobile) or "" "" captured. "" "</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the marahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US the game led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 people reprosecuted, the Washington Post recently reaped that within two days of launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to take" "" "30 minutes" "" "to be active" "" "from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day, because many public messages are too dull and coming from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives regularly, reduces its chances to diseased to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that too long is to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that people do so much outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are murderous killings that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit already could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exaggerate sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, and will help many people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine among the women's Olympic Council and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at each summer olympic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie's Hernandez, who worked for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and hispanic presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one Afro-American woman in the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise in the competition and in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world world cup in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected, but masterful Gymatic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-week event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man-member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see the classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last five" "" "because the next Olympiad will only have four turnerns in the crew. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turtles are a dearer sport and gymnasts be maintained primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents, which pay for the training, furnishings, travel and hotel rooms (for the trainers and their families and families). the list can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these associations, the gymnasts receive their overall training and that is for families an expensive and long-term engagement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes, since they started with the turbo.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to open the churches aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to provide a better and easily accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnfoundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer a free and affordable turbo in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turbines that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turtles develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long advantages for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this squad that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the turbo and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you, you will be motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he abandoned, more than a poor neighbor in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resilience of its intestines by travelling through the world, and for a good as well as wonderful things.</seg>

<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometres is fresh swired hands less than 60.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site was emigrated on Monday to the south and the block of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is rebuilt, the traffic situation inside the town has relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were partly considerable discomfort," says the Deputy Chief Executive Director Florian King for the transport management of the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachelstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many narrow paths looked for and more their Navi trusted as the signage.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has on a request from Göhner, if there might be a financial compensation, otherwise benefitted the Gaststätte, otherwise from the advantages of location at the B 27. now, they also have the disadvantages that result from refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other counties where some generously was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all boxes, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue.</seg>

<seg id="42">That its regular climate after the end of the restoration work again, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird-barbecue, Göhner holds the effects of B 27 construction on its clientele for the greatest crisis, which has experienced its hospitality in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in case of impatient treatment, for example - the question arises: what actually does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is actually buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you get to the commentary in order to revise it under the pseudonym non AlleEinsamman's men with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the profound redevelopment of Schallplatten is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the unity of physical objects, but to the mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I sit in the middle of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray approach and wildly, before I stick, my hands hold and something determining how:" "" "so, let us take a closer look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slow in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman the camera to turn off the camera in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I go by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into the Recess Records (data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably about the 20) succession, is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail. I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy objects he sold as he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60ies, early 70ies, which was published when I was 11 or 12. things I probably had something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who are buying the plates, are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I will not drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the medienhpe people who have heard about the comeback and have prompted themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations I have led, people usually have been forced to empt their collection in 1998 or 1999." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the plate grounds of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like phonica to see that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar soundplattentions, of objects, and happy Jugenderers.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to engage mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "like a staff of a record-stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I blower through a stack at Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy aspects" of the Revials.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record, so I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More production-lashing, less music clasper.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only slowly reinforces them.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fstop, which has devoted the sound board to almost a whole floor, has a small audience, when I go down.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-standing shops - Wild Beasts Reester synthesizer and sexier pop instead of experimental jazz. by speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks sunny, but wet mental traumata are hard to detectable if you stand for up to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a mannequin as a major purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or another, but the beauty of plates is... "she is driving with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it truly is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, by which it is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban outfit.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to mute the jeans the jeans hotbed, I watch a group of young teenagers, which group for a moment to group Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter consider themselves to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them up.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these objects will mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my inquiries made the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in records in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and in online fores, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday morning with certainty from record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they envy to the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year old moderator, which protrudes over the shoulders of the middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Dealer stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, follow-up and rotating power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sent by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they were able to take pride in their efforts in this tournament, in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, no one would have defeated in this form a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former manager for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">Britain had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she was lost in Ryan of any game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop is going to do, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks GBs out of fun draining.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell, and Co. at the moment one would run in driving buses. the World Series-winner went from 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai has yet another attack from the right corner that he turned into.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely made the ball labeled.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hot flashy tail of Mitchell stops the mountain of husband Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has not only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua took a touch-down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the Restanpfiff and there was still over a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tactics of the GB teams and stormed down to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, as if Fiji was born to play 7, while GB still continue to read.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out fundamental changes for half-time and closed the fijiian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left-hand corner for a 36-7 but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Pacific, whose fans sang, cheeks and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the cake cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff erönte, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked off crushing in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Previous on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 defeats and Britain crowned South Africa in a scarce half-final match of the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive footwork, and scored a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant ceremony of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, won the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing machines</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinalership gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke of up to the last, 220 hard Hieve, die in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two who sat at the ruin, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present as her for the second Olympiagold at two without tax wife in a row driven by the first women in the history of the British sport who laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolute, after all her 39.0unted use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not the nature of the Triumphal to dazzle.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd there is a battalion to wilful heroines who account the difference and it was no one assistant as the coach, who would not survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed in cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operating and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start treatment early 2014, out of season, could start what the interruption occurred to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The herd of itself is already a challenge, but this makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inadability of victory they went their first thought to Williams, who spent a nerve-up morning and tried to talk more than usual and therefore tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was as captain in the Royal Arllery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan said, "I was this week an emotional wreck. this might be something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wished for a better person to carry out a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark closed, Stanning and Glover had to reserve a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make a bit of Tolles.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this Filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is nonsensibly towards breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are undumpous, self-blooded tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfishings per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All failures come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filter have drawn up criticism in the past that they have been accused of using the app Blackface muscles or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week caused a filter to some utensils, that gave them slew, wrong teeth and dunswerd cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature from Asiatic - "yellow sighted."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy is pointing to a greater problem that the company has its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat included that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asian.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced Rotissm, reminded the filter of breaking clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos that the filter "hurtful and eased was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">It added that "it is difficult to argue with the counterpart of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not far-sighted, but that the yellowing was removed to the declining extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless seal and integration of integration, from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are diversed in the race as their older counterparts - could likely be expecting to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided, who works as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete their Snapchat account, and called for others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that ratory controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the introductory practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, just male leaders and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any figures for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it refused to discuss Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company has recently focused on a human resource management that focuses on underpresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said in his turn, that she is closed her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is OK."</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shed three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they cannot remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet they know that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equaled to their group with the Britons in the first place after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last turn of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which both of the two teams will win their first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first platter will take a little longer from the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex, four years after they landed over the last London games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team all went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, a coach of the National Team, and thus the things became better to use.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the govern in the first half of the game with a return stop from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone out to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprising and held the player from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the center, and swallowed the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are inconsistent and inescapable of doing a rapid relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's like the Olympic Fackel itself would be a flaker stab, who is from the bracelet to swimmers to the triathlete for the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop, without using Simone Biles, Katie Lecovers or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are also Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with grabs, would have quite been among these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time, rebuilt by sponsors and wellness-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fear.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminated any event any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air palleyarchery, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastswimming and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular darling, let me direct the attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been an Olympic Debut 2000, it was perceived the last 16 years so spawful that many that I asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasporttype.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had had a athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who are responsible for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain outdoor character, partly because it sounds suitable for the unexplained ear for a clownage school as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a reled enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the charitable tremor of his never to end cloudy - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that unites it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, yeast and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympiad they are rated according to the design, difficulty of difficulty and "air time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-four athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go on in their quest for gold faster, go up and down, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and back, down and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV broadcast another height: that of the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about playing these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A moving movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, apparently weightless like an astronomer, goes up, then effortlessly back up, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without any difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no overcast in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end-round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end of the end as part of a follow-up area on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, cute moment, one that is likely to overlook the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the appreciation of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objectivity of male athletes, as it recently presented the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his to air.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demand political changes in Ethiopia, stickers on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police in shearing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years there was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months the protests against the government were shaken by the country, and they had more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses showed that policemen were shot on desperate protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the reversed well-being video about the protests, presumably from the last or beginning of this year, are showing how safety people beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority on Human Rights now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country and it will be even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, the dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground use to the stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a wide criticized election last year the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which were forced to take advantage of the turmoil in recent years and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of the hovering under the surface is now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially for protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies who conceal where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave us that they were gathered for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from edics to the predominantly Christian strongholds, in politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which make up approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a publicized disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who was able to think corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly embarrassed to perceive the early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively insightful reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of North-Ethiopian, comes Mr. Hailemariam from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, that Ethiopia experienced such a revolt in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which apparently falsified by the government, according to statements by analyst.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps, many protesters were killed, even though it were less than in the last few months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ethiopian Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new compromisist, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, of Tigray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is always more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests supported by the USA and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronger's trips on the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently changed that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want his allies to merge in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="8">A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebraanimal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland often only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland was only getting up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely floats of Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is at an average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to climbs, the five metre long shot up to the satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a robe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of long-blooded lifestyle might seem to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span that means a world ord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland become a rocky one.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees, they usually dive on the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers about the lifestyles of Greenland know researchers correspondingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-motion empathy, they, when they started out of Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter-stator.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot these sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a robe, another had swallowed the jaw of a young ice-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look at Kadaver that torches from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, whereas the largest 502 centimetres long.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the ruler of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the sharks, which in it there are no longer redone in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsentia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear-weapon-attempts, larger amounts of this radioactive carbon carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which with 220 centimeters length, the smallest animal contained in contrast a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland had in their lenses on the other hand normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-watch for a 493 centimetres long Greenland an age of 335 years, during the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only then get off when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers could assign a age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland with the multiplication was obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenlandwal, in which speck put on the neck at the neck-neck at the neck-tip, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures there is often the organism living there on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal acquires heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives thus more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "a very big animal should deal with it rather than investing their resources in a long life." ""</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the landing role, which was made by Sir Chris Hoy. the young and made the legend proudly, when he fell at home to make a victory of the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England has claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympiad medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after it took place in March at the railway world cup in London despite the backend Hoys, just one modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Jamie staff.</seg>

<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) are taking place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins is certainly in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had taken up yesterday with notice before the qualifications, when he called upon him to measure his body size.</seg>

<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving its strong track team to dominate the average period of the Olympic Games and to fetch a shot at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio fell down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama's drama in the background, leaving the resignation of the technical guidance Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexismus- and harrows and retirement from sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>

<seg id="11">The unveiling of his coverstar is expected as unselfish, that in the last two years images of the journal descended before the official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of their generation - in the past category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">These are truly talented women, who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.</seg>

<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners was always tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June he criticized the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the gauge of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings blend again high, when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and internet in time lupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia communicator came onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its producer has experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather big.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at first eight megabyte, which would reach today for about two selfishers with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with a minimum of 16 gigabyte.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 communicator" was launched just 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the business - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros enthusiasts can still buy the devices on the internet, but they are somehow from the stone-time of the internetage.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the computer fair at CeBIT in Hanover as an "office in the western-format" format. "</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could send a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also via fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit quelly slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be worked out similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there is a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could have imagined in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell-saving of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and closed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today dominate suppliers that came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is today a lot of people today.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold around 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple alone, 555 million pieces.</seg>

<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet-communication, all accessible via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The success of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market had the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="35">It disappeared finally, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Saw now have Apple and Asian vendor like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is 20 years after its invention, a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="38">The average is now 88 times a day on his cell phone.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was most likely to be inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once again.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow upheaval of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, inherited similar atmosphere and still persisted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet thought probably more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect life more rapidly evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow upheaval of Venus their daily side of the Sun is nearly two months long," GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer clouds, which looks like a Umbrella, to prevent the surface from a large proportion of the sunbed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that some degree cools than the Earth today are.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was formerly inhabited, the Venus -- in the course of several billions years, exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans are blamed and their water vapor was burned down by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datklau: so perfide presses her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing-malware are currently targeting company - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of Malware's specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly several victims of an attack with blacksmith software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims are willingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specialised their blacksmith software according to the observations of Malwarebytes with attacks on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to erase ransom fall significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of the damage software," "" "explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleccynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, the perpetrators discovered creation software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only did private users were the goal, but the change towards company attacks was frightening quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she is looking for unlong changed files like Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypting the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of cryptic Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are using the personal photo database on the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is tackled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms surveyed by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to underbreak the business completely, in case of a case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we are saying the victims always: pays not, you just promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators of a standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure the utility properties and the contact with blackmailers examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They express their sacrifices via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access-accessible support websites or unencode for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundredth euro, businesses have to partly negotiate harsh and five-digit totals to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively high-risk income from the Ransomware extortion, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains security expert Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider of Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software building to the actual prescriptions.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the Malware himself, consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blacksmith will then look for further hackers in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logins in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of criminals and assigned a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per incalculated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry the spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies providing their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies-IT-leaders in the Malwarebytes survey rely on ransomware using file-back-ups and Scanner.com.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful eressation more, threaten the perpetrators with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes damage to the type of data still a few times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even the perpetrators of the perpetrators could be taking completely new goals in the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety researchers as they could get control of using the Internet of linked thermostat.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "in the middle of winter, the activist of such a blocking heating could be worth a ransom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future can block a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening one rolled up eternally, at night you are awake in the morning, in the morning it is far from the Weckerklinges no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep, and over ten percent experience their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeplessness?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many different causes underlie, Hans-Günter Wedin, board member of the German Society for Schlafes and Schlafes.</seg>

<seg id="8">Just that permeating many people experience as unsatisfying or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German house medical association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep-dysfunctions?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>

<seg id="15">Those, for example, has a slipped disk, can be bad, guarded every two to three hours and blurry to greet more about everyday problems and care, gives vastly an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one go to a doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who are not well sleeps about a period of a month in at least three nights per week and if the day is impaired, should go to the doctor, aved them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods fluctuations or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find their causes.</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "low-time sleep" "" "in Germany hardly, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">This can determine if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an examination in the sleeping laboratory medicine, for example, with snoring with respiratory sufferings, with disease-fatigue, at bedbugs, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy-compulsive disorder, fietze explains.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altconstructions, a few lime trees, in the meantime by still a remainder of the cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain effect does not affect the first glance, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walk along the road from east to west, one arrives at slots, a freshen nursery and a biolades past.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "at the façade of a gray house, someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which should also be demolished, will already be built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district" as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred by burning cars over the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the inhabitants of rental agreements, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning of the year Henkel, especially the Berlin inside of the year had been declared a hard action of the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on June 22nd the rooms were evacuated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, reportedly patrolling the police three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team racing cars on site, blocking parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building construction work on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents strolling with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main inhabitants of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who stood here three children, are mainly built by the police force.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects they share the care of rising rents and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a pine, who wanted to make himself predominantly political pledge in front of vandalion left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior and the police are open between domestic and their neighbours, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which also compared to the rest of the city a low average and a high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and those born-born projects have long been a maxim: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer road close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated at a large police station in a controlled street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and were still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral liners from around the world: with them the inhabitants of the GDR and former household occupied its jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also presents itself with the rents, which has risen since 2009 by nearly 60 percent in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize them at worshipped slices or freshly knitted facades, which were carded with color beutlern.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words" "" "lefautonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason is that not all neighbours might regard this as a problem, it might not necessarily be affected by the crime: offences such as body breaking, statistics reveal almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences make kind of damage, which tends to be rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is subtle: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, which certainly did not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars do not pass it directly in the rig.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, their road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary, "here one helps to each other, lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to the Riga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the inhabitants gained their street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claims the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of dwellers such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to take away: through the unobstructed newbuildings in former building gaps, which throng the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately proprietary apartments, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I do absolutely no." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never dies?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For discarving who affectionate themselves about color-bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house-projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who run, should be aware of this - just like someone who attracts a bar in a pub that can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons reserved only with previous names are asked to be called on with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuterle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuterle is the contact for participation in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuterle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, refugee camps, refugee, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working class indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuterle is now there, the eigh Wolly sau, which above all have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less spotted than rather pointed to the multitude of challenges we desire - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">She was looking for a administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a comprehensive Wolllisau.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network connection.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on the occasion of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuterle honorable and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and insurrecess problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the connection-controls, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the state office to the Commune and the Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">To date, it does not work so far, that one is dependent on private homes, so Deuteries.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be ascertained as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, are Regine customer and Annika Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apart from a fixed base, there are traineers, training places, education places, one-euro-jobs and export activities for refugees and migrants who must be jumped up or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuterle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive margin.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Occupation, however, does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuterle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a coherent feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also to jump here managing and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to declare the refugees that it just takes and they can make time sensible, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but problems are also," "" "says customers" "" "people, with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuterle and customer is therefore always interested to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "this is all a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the most recent incidents fear of radicalization, even in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some are naive to call." "" "a waste risk and wants to close them out." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassination attempt to put them entirely in recall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers must be held on site and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new peak of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, scrap the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived, where we want to go," Annika Deuterle said.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are also busy even so that the previous human beings are reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women are unanimous.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
