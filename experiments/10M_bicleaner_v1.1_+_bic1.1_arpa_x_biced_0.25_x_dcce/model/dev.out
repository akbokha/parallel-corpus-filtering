the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington considers the state of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ lasting settlement of Israel and raises the def@@ ective will in the peace process .
through the rebellion of Obama &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship of the two continues to deterior@@ ate .

in a not@@ ch conf@@ esses Professor , his girlfriend s@@ shot
in a note , Professor Sh@@ annon told him with a slightly rough voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &apos; sweet dog &apos; is still alive and probably be excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ mi and a hand@@ written mem@@ os that threw on a white block : &quot; I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , who killed himself at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university people have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he did the ru@@ in@@ ous rescue at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police mo@@ cked him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
the details , as well as the investig@@ ators of the two ends of the state , as well as what students and collaborators , who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
they said they were looking forward to their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where pr@@ enti@@ er died , said , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself was a written book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sub@@ stitutes in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose educational bodies were 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some neg@@ ation to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers who &apos;s blessing , said he seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University to lau@@ ght for health reasons and said that he had some health @-@ related problem .
in this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policies of the university meant that the promotion , for which he had been working so hard for him , no guarantee would represent an automatic way to a dis@@ position as Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university @-@ president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ole &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that he can no longer answer .
after the flight out of the campus the police found later lam@@ bs track , as he returned to Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as imports .
before he could be arrested , he killed his own .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , &quot; told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he began his work on the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he took his doc@@ torate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long years of friends called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
you and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar game .
he was then the woman &apos;s warm .
all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ er@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the speech he said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
you had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders a bath in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband by Pr@@ er@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were made 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met her , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues .
he met Pr@@ er@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail emerged both in a summer @-@ year @-@ market three years ago .
later they played together for one or two gigs .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter write and sing her own music .
Pr@@ er@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining reception at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw his guitar and bru@@ ises Night at night 5 . September after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ harmon@@ ic@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there were no signs of anything that was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .

I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN manager calls once again on all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on the finding of a political solution .
B@@ an said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts the post@@ ures in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation can be in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have proved in achieving a nuclear ab@@ dic@@ ated with Iran .
8 re@@ frac@@ tor@@ ates which show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious about it .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him off as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks with surveys from above , it did not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mos@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
none claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led tour to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which none of which won even one state into the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
however , outside side @-@ groups such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and start to flow off their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Bel@@ ieb@@ ox points have turned about 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate m@@ gu@@ l positively .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep themselves in early countries .
a Quin@@ ten pi@@ ac @-@ voting in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with am@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can party said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son brings about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in respect of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , was the candidate .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans does not see temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish re@@ public@@ ans say that the real temper@@ ament for a president have , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first pre @-@ State of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for an Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ten pi@@ ac last week .
yet , 44 per cent , that he did not have the personality to effectively carry his position , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters do not get used to the idea .
if they insert their nests , hold republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
if you are asked who most likely won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp would be the best bet .
this is a change since the moment when four of the ten end of July put their money to Cal@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ all@@ ine in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidates Ben@@ ney .
however , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters of Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign are regarded as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ can pi@@ ans around another candidate , Tru@@ mp goes almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the cr@@ atter@@ ing field will likely contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , whereas the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ support is un@@ diff@@ used on more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp are ap@@ mp .
he has 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would pick up the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head @-@ race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans says they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters want to support the Tru@@ mp for giving their voices firmly .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often as for folks .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign was called &quot; rape from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was called immigration and the ful@@ crum point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic spelling of Tru@@ mp &apos;s pivot@@ al H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and re@@ define the new @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they disagree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration lies in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp is apparently also going to do .
the frustration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
by now , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son is about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington as well .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans were frustrated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , containing 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; polite . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential areas in Germany
here is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ heel .
in the street you cost a square meter of a house @-@ roof@@ ed house average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; Sy@@ lt is limited to the supply of objects according to objects , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular positions a square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ locations , one of the price is , as well as pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate service angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square footage in correc@@ tive places .
there are several tens of ten thousand Euros -- per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is located here relatively , not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ stra@@ ds thanks to Müller and Go@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ ment@@ e in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a thank@@ fully hit by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign in the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ tz@@ e have launched a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; at the Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Piraeus .
the team of coach PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers dou@@ pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ tz@@ es results ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star victory in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final in the final on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally pick up the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third session .
Müller received at his 28th of matches in the Champions League of the Championship @-@ management of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ino Roberto who made a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the master &apos;s shot .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate , &quot; had promised Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ my before the game in the caravan stadium completed before the 31 6@@ 88 @-@ blo@@ b fans - and the Munich received word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept without being shiny .
Piraeus had won his recent six home@@ games in the Royal Class , including against suggested clubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 proud here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria died in seven Europ@@ ak@@ eup with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were going to be brave , with their open@@ sive efforts but often too cre@@ atively to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a shift to Lin@@ ks@@ crew Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against the previous Braunschweig declaration of Omar El@@ de@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had from the right more luck , when his f@@ lange is taken out of the right half @-@ field in the left column .
in the 6@@ 7th night the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ally Brown struck the head@@ ball of Poland on the line ( 26 ) .
then via direct removal , the scor@@ eline Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bavaria moved her in dominant play , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set sa@@ ils .
at the Tor@@ tor@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was Lost .
so about , when he drew a shot of ideas about the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quad@@ rup@@ ture with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it good .
Mario Go@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Championship has just given green light after the final qualifying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jas@@ vor@@ y Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants something else to make out of it is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y com@@ an for the commemor@@ ated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller to set another shot .
before the game came to Kra@@ w@@ all in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly gi@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their viewers @-@ block apparently had prov@@ oked the adher@@ ents of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went up with headlines against the Mün@@ chner followers .
at least a Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , doesn &apos;t pull away not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that lays down a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : when distr@@ acts the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking , smoking is risk of losing their teeth matur@@ ely in order to fold the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher .
the researchers had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main contributors to tooth decay - decay and inflammation of the tooth representation , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
therefore , the relationship between smoking and dental loss occurs therefore on most commonly infl@@ amed g@@ ums with smokers .
not be clarified , to which extent smoking also increases the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who &apos;ve heard with smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could last for ten years until the haz@@ ard decl@@ ines over to the level of non @-@ divers , the exchange Bureau Thomas Diet@@ rich at the English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people that non @-@ smokers to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ a Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to our findings to a good dental clinic to the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population , aged 65 to 74 years of dentistry , DI@@ f@@ E distributed .
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study unter@@ acts the findings .

European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TTIP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current Ar@@ atlantic Trade Agreement on the TTIP planned for the planned Trans@@ atlantic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) .
the controversial private arbitration institutions to disputes between companies and states are meant to be replaced with a more transparent system , which in its operation fits significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system which trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish has presented the proposal as European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the TTIP is to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbitr@@ ators look specifically to discuss the EU states and the US together to create independent judges for a new investment programme .
they are supposed to be equally important in the EU , the USA and from third countries .
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against judgment .
up to now the procedures among each other at the refer@@ ee will be , a possibility of an objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments does not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and fairness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an international investment course .
the disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries might be clarified there .
the above @-@ mentioned main investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration jurisdictions were critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel , about the firms of compensation , tax@@ payers , national laws claim , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards prevail .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act reported the proposals from the European Commission to be insufficient .
he was critici@@ zed especially that they are not supposed to apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German state @-@ state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ ado ( SPD ) , however , stands out the plans of a great progress .
the Commission considered the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel gathered in the spring with other EU trade ministers .

well @-@ born Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart that recorded the shy res@@ trained Fol@@ ks@@ än@@ ger the picturesque US state of Michigan with film @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by Stev@@ ens lecture .
he talks on the basis of various places that he always featured on the map to tell about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ vi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they came into being and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens also proves to be wonderfully Cre@@ ating .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart comp@@ osing songs , that are harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American Folk of the late 1960s , but at any time to great opul@@ ent .
the ru@@ mor , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a dis@@ appearing series : each of the 50 U.S. states ought to be de@@ tained in a row .
yet in 2004 and in Rhin@@ o already &quot; Seven Coun@@ ans &quot; had already appeared and had a positive effect on certain expectations .

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and won &apos;t be missing on any yearly list of the influential music media .
according to the productive experiments , Mr. Stev@@ ens has served well extensive electronic journal articles at &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this Six@@ ti@@ ary studio album is still very wide orchest@@ rated , yet supported by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ te debut in the car@@ esses of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns participated in the Prime Minister with tension in his election .
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ te is alleged to give his debut in the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will stand up to noon for the first of his six pre@@ determined questions , whereby his performance by the media is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from its proximity .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; during this Weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ pped some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s leadership , as she comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime the Labour Party Decision took place on Tuesday during the singing of the National hybrid with a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the center of several title @-@ pages @-@ stories in newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ne has drawn attention to itself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have stun@@ ned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a respectful way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party to sing the national hybrid , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the shade @-@ ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excellent team and they were conven@@ ed in differences in business , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parli@@ ament@@ ary Party was originally supported as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are st@@ acking within Labour &apos; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of threads .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that the TU@@ C Conference said that Labour wishes to remove all the idea of limiting their limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadows and pensions Minister said that the party is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory leader , over the last decade , over the Disp@@ atch box in the parliament .
the Labour President , who promised a different policy approach , says he gave &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is on confron@@ t@@ ational and that he has made both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stri@@ w@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the fight with counter@@ bar@@ king and has instead made to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who is represented in the shadow of economic ministries , if he is not participating - for example , if Mr. Cameron is on the way abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally grasp the Word and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the property , addressed to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is often linked to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; but some years later he adm@@ its that he failed to have failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she was first sent on television first in 1990 , he was regarded as a major bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in his Commons and his position among his parliament@@ ar@@ ism , although critics did have argued that she had become a caricature and have far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has spr@@ inging up data that will show a rise in the post @-@ growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was enhanced with the building goal SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.4 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est last year since 2009 and brought an estim@@ ation over the time of an interest increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was shortened to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro on 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the prominent stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Riv@@ als AB In@@ Bed@@ ou@@ was .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands like Bud@@ ì@@ ch , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares have been encouraged by encouraging news from the competition for luxury goods ri@@ chemicals of 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ e &apos;s latest sales numbers propose all expectations and also demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for berry - growth reg@@ isters .
shares of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining industry said that he has taken 2.5 billion $ through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper group MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , which resulted in a decrease of 4.@@ 3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s has set up his assessment for the company rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % after the sports@@ wear company for the first half had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endangering the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it seems impro@@ bable the fact that this buying power will be the higher labor force at his company , he says .
the cost could make expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean there are fewer additional jobs .
Justin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : ben@@ ding expedition in Berlin
Justin Bie@@ ber , Me@@ gast@@ ar .
Lä@@ s 21 years young , a hand@@ ing with top @-@ top F@@ rise .
the type with the plat@@ in@@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur is Bie@@ ber in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 is rotating .
like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; not yet .
not bad .
hundreds of fans followed Justin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
however , at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ lock is sitting on the cold tur@@ qu@@ els of the Berlin deluxe hotel at the Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : this is where her i@@ dol is living in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday night .
the suite , where the Canadian artist lives , takes on the day exactly as much as their m@@ ama has earned in half a year .
if at all .
that says : &quot; actually , my Wi@@ kt@@ oria should sit in the tenth class in the Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfil her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory schooling ?
who is youth ?
the fans were not .
also ben@@ ding himself not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he already has taken care of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the advertising in the Advertising module of the Super@@ bow@@ ls he finished three million , one bi@@ ol@@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le firm , many , many dollars to ben@@ ding account .
and with every doll that looks like it and passes over the counter , ben@@ ding ben@@ ding also .
if Justin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee in touch with the wind@@ shield .
more than 100 million should he have so exploited .
some say the h@@ ype were too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that bent in the USA and the United Kingdom with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself who is to follow his fourth album in November are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings the Lebanese Beh@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ ner @-@ Ide@@ as
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ ner ?
it is both - and in the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ n , who has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he saw by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then this shop has a barbecue which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; it is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has joined the Lebanese Army in Munich in the meantime .
it has recently been protected as use for use by the authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much meat and how much the potatoes of the Spie@@ ß contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only as much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds .
even with its customers the culinary international understanding come well .
Met@@ cash launches bottom @-@ monitoring campaign to combat alchem@@ y
Met@@ boo@@ sters tries to protect the Ig@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributor Met@@ rac has started an insur@@ rec@@ tive campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Pro@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice @-@ maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores specimens and shop owners , which sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to publish a few cash further details of its defensive strategy on September 29 , if wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investors strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A stores and higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A networks in the east states .
also , buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with around 14 per cent in the east states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di has cut away over five percent of the food market in these two countries , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ consoli@@ dates 360 million sales annually and Met@@ als can lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the prognosis will be based on that Al@@ di has opened 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in the food and food shop and with the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high over@@ base could cost reductions of about 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most popular .
Morgan Stan@@ ley carries out that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business rose by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 , and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in the year 2018 , and reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne that Pro@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ ck@@ backs refused to respond publicly to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ adata with Mr Dou@@ glass co @-@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent in 2010 , and revenue deri@@ ving from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 percent , is a total of 43 percent , reflecting long @-@ term pressure on turnover and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , to deliver the sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products per week to improve their stores with fast growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private @-@ label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice said that the pricing and shop san@@ itation programs can be put in el@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in four years for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ases is supported by the President of the Australian tennis courts , Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ases deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ase was one of the &quot; Col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as a critique of his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger conducted by talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , came to the Montreal Masters with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison was twice separated by the refer@@ ee while Harrison was saying : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to lay Kyr@@ gios , and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a var@@ n@@ f van@@ iled a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was rep@@ lic@@ ated by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals on Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I was desper@@ ate , is the fact that after my mind Than@@ asi was raised a bit in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a rac@@ quet as he lost because of a stri@@ pe in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat from frustration with himself and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he got extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old who works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players he is doing well in the locker area , he worked hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gios in the crucial proposal decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision , &quot; as the right for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm part in the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the check@@ ered members &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick was very fast made up to the public , and he has made some per@@ il@@ ful mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider suitable for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary st@@ ings out , closing the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and pushed the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all notes which tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a No Man &apos;s Land , and Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence , given end for a unknown period in a strip at the road between the two control points of the lands and erected tents , and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations went on board .
as a police helicopter flight over them , the migrants &quot; openings &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an .
some was taken from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collective damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Austr@@ o @-@ Ser@@ b border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc with a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels to arrange a common immigration policy .
the Ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 40,000 people who would escape in over Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not set his hopes for a rapid action in Brussels or its neighbours .
the emergency room in two southern regions gave authorities more power to cope with the crisis , so that they were able to block the roads and accelerate the grounds of asylum .
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed @-@ wi@@ red line along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after crossing a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ breeds in the race , to create e@@ dev@@ out fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks and entrance to the European Union elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban also insisted that most upcoming business people are in search of a better life , and not for war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws passed at midnight in Hungary into force , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns , who established the government alongside the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sti@@ pen@@ alties for sentenced man negoti@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Government of Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac repor@@ ters in the southern part of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must not yet approve the use of the military that is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others have already penetr@@ ated deep into the country .
they come across as they inf@@ ring@@ ing the fence , they are now in a police and be accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are thereby rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian civil servants involved in the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with st@@ ing@@ wire to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened up a small office in a metal container to tackle the data of people and thrust a crowd to push themselves up .
about 20 did not succeed , but thousands stayed outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants held the main highway link from Serbia and Hung@@ arians , saying that they would be food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ ander in a national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins its opposite to the ground .
Clinton has now released the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the preceding elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second only , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den which has not announced yet if he joined the presidential office for the presidential election , will receive support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the election .
more than five months prior to the elections , most of the democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is tigh@@ tened to the candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ ically supporters are more enduring than those of the other candidates in their election .
since the C@@ BS @-@ news survey , Clinton has lost over a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders had some prizes .
Clinton holds a big head start with women and mixtures , but these jumps have decreased .
their support among the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has become avi@@ d under 50 years and are now on the same height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big lead over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton had been a two @-@ point advantage with the liber@@ als in the last month , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic majority of the preliminary elections are saying that they would be able to support with the Clinton neighborhood if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some supervis@@ ors and a further 15 percent they would only support because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ically current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are stronger at those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would aid them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say in the election , they Clinton to support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their spit@@ zen@@ kan@@ di@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) .
when Clin@@ ique be asked in an open question why they want it to be the nomin@@ ee , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best nomin@@ at@@ as for the job ( 10 percent ) .
the association with Bill Clinton is also mentioned as well as their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the handling of the problems and constitu@@ ability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Vice President raises potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want him to see him in the race , though a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the election , who would be their second choice for the Party is Bi@@ den at the helm .
Clin@@ ics &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of their second choice elsewhere .
if Bi@@ enn@@ es decided not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s prot@@ ru@@ dder increases in front of S@@ anders , of twenty points with Bi@@ den in a race to 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this number of 78 percent has fallen in the last month .
Bi@@ osphere is by far a second in this measuring , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to candidates , democratic voters call questions about voters .
similar to last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters are not acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results with some important qualities in choosing voters of their party .
apartments have seen Clinton , S@@ ander and bi@@ ds as honest and trusted and equipped with strong manager .
bee cuts with the three candidates best from honesty , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy - twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have any opinion of him .
democratic majority of the present elections also generally fores@@ ees Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological in accordance with their views .
about a quarter of the democratic voters do not believe in all these measurements .
because questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton is continuing to be using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the Presidential term , most of the Democratic voters of the preliminary elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this happened in March , shortly after the issue came to light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy did not have any impact on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views have been made by Clinton worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of her party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered elec@@ tors . only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
they do not consider 62 percent of those entitled to vote for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the vote constitu@@ ents see also Tru@@ mp as not honest and cannot be trusted .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp are however given good notes at the helm .
out of the six tested candidates , bee@@ keepers , Car@@ son and Bush get the best from honesty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son do not have any opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; error rate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son is moving in a nationwide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS news / New York Times tight behind Donald Tru@@ mp
the two candidates exp@@ ires about half of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters do not support Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in the Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
however , Car@@ son gre@@ oss in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphic groups highlighted well and Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of early Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Ka@@ sich , is fallen by the Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest fell , and that by 10 % of support last month is now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ governor J@@ ef Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % on the third place .
the error message at the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was performed in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is going to be in the surveys - he lands at 19 % of the re@@ public@@ ans behind the Tru@@ mp using 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed zap@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view of one over the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side drives for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on the last Saturday during a follow @-@ up appearances in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood neg@@ atively charged with the death of a bar@@ ren College
nearly two years after a student died during a multi @-@ channel ritual for a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , are M@@ ord@@ ant filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ PSI bro@@ therhood attacked ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory meeting in September 2013 , and hesit@@ ated his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he was trying to go through a frozen area on a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ PSI leaders did not deny the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and claimed an hour before they brought him to hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ ger &apos;s clothes , to get his symptoms peace@@ able and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood , said Mr Mim@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of hiding U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien and created the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood as a general of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Pol@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his wounds .
after an automatic rehearsal , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unter force in head , h@@ ull and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the bro@@ ws of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the Shi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer of the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by government authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members referred to as Mor@@ ro@@ e County .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with serious attack and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to make the individuals involved but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a Zin@@ o increase comes , and the car@@ se will get into the bed@@ side , get paid for bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long all this will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy offers only low guidance on the procedure .
just 11 months ago a recession came to the first interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments are responding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have thus strongly emphasized that investors will not focus on it when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could see , however , that the whole excitement of a zinc increase might be exaggerated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief counter@@ part at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to the se@@ is@@ mic shock to which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historic trend based on how some areas of the economy can react :
as has seen the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of zinc increases things for a while volati@@ le .
once the elevated level , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be decreased from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analy@@ st in a newer study to what happens to interest rate increases .
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in warming - about 14 per cent - on their way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.4 % ) , then reported back to the average result in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis done by Bob D@@ oll , head facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stock tends to occur later in the increases cycle and will therefore begin to decrease it .
rec@@ essions include a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ o@@ ases often encourage them .
in the present case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not happen before and which might accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that gross Dom@@ estic Product is in the vicinity of its lowest point at a Zin@@ c increase will be F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 rate of interest rates , nominal GDP had been less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.@@ 6 percent , only few , that this will last , and expect the third quarter in Atlanta from Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
in such an fragile economic setting could be risky and asked the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year on a steady increase in F@@ ed ; and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could have a increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the ca@@ vities had taken place from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly left the rest of the recovery in the shade , &quot; so the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly long @-@ time rec@@ u@@ ity from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months .
the solid income was also volati@@ le , because the market increases a steady increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than when you share its strategic course .
a bonds appear to change the rendering time as soon as the first increase / lowering is made in the cycle .
at the end of the rise cycle , the firms fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in bringing the gap between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter ening of the curve .
high @-@ proliferation bonds often bring better yields in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
nonetheless , Jones believes that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has been adapted to the prospect of more stringent standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates are risen , the ur@@ ch@@ ur@@ ve is fl@@ atter , lending have increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market once the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in large and whole , companies who wrap up the greater part of their business activities in the US , benefit from interest rates , increasing interest rates and local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and so much the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; Quality - &quot; to respond to positive interest three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in one report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have out@@ performed companies with increased balance sheet after each of their interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ ces and low volati@@ lity in its stock also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a major problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
Spar@@ er could see profits through higher yields , even though experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the radio station because of its &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also took to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got the broadcast The Voice on and said this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the radio station to prove that he does something to do with the missing forces .
the Conserv@@ ative member of Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ens &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly being distinguished from its commercial competition .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t treat the word &quot; silly &quot; - but it seems to turn off on Classic FM &quot; he said .
he also took to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously examples where you actually just im@@ itate the im@@ itate of what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate pointed out the dis@@ cards and argued that BBC Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and education to the public .
what I am learning about Radio 3 I &apos;m going to learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music making music really un@@ matched .
&quot; and giving the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on order , I consider it really important . &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to be working to engage the public when it was in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during a hearing organised in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport for this under fire , move the commercial ri@@ vals into the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , The Voice on - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked ?
Lord Hall insisted that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge , was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a hit from our in @-@ house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is the next time a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of another series of The Voice in future or to give money out the other payers for other entertaining formats .
Internet commerci@@ alism climbed in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , the lowest result since the records began in 2000
online sales increased over three years ago by the use of cell phones to one
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issue
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online revenues are st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers shown only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales will st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has evolved over time , &quot; says Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales increased over three years ago , as a buyer started to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes one and we may possibly discover that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for retro@@ fitting revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold their shopping before this event , taking place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times scar@@ ed the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers @-@ sites crashed .
experts believe that black Friday in which the buyer cont@@ ested for bar@@ gains , buyers could hold down purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that 5 million issues was spent a little over £ 1 £ online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now carried out more than one third of the sh@@ opp@@ ings out over the web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people purchases clothes and shoes online instead of in the domestic cities .

B &amp; Q Boss is said to have the time of cheap east crafts@@ man craftsmen .
British are increasingly occupied cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has an increase behind
this leads to the fact that 200 more scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen , are opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q business places close at the same time
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British re@@ tire their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush regarding con@@ ta@@ gious walls , they appear to be a minority .
for British are increasingly employ crafts to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the building markets chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices has since become outdated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix , is planning to open 200 more screens , close to craftsmen and 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions during the shop are made by women .
at the moment ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the staff the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than having more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of males in our branches .
we must move this stronger into a balance .
generally , half of our customers from women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the head of a British at FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also changed its top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company that has occupied about 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial investment .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .

function@@ aries of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the helm of Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday , there have been two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court . A@@ ich / DO@@ B responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and issuing @-@ education .
the Acc@@ used is not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the for@@ er@@ al Robert Ri@@ ffel ( 2005 ) , the accused did cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of association accounts where they were allowed to use in their functions disponi@@ eren , for private purposes .
the damage was reduced with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sport function@@ aries are also indicted by means of finance .
this fact was divided by the chairman of the Gover@@ nor , Ri@@ dge in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the re@@ pro@@ clamation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity represented the defence that the association had at no time been an asset .
the sporting function@@ aries had only reck@@ oned resolutions and the sports club , for which they have been active in 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the pas@@ o beg@@ s in 2001 around 600@@ .000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we were in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or lock us ? &quot; &quot; , one of the def@@ endants , at the bre@@ wers of the financial market .
and he decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have prescribed money , laid out our life insurance as a safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association may be arranged : you can manage the money freely , there must be only no debt .
furthermore , be - in the case of appropriate financial - success the payout of the allowance for repar@@ ations were determined by 1991 .
therefore , one has become a part of the allowance for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was deposited on the account from 2003 .
thus , p@@ ump sum and not detail finishes , explained the former Ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and sub @-@ books managed the two offen@@ ders together , said the second def@@ endant .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not detailed detailed , asked the judge .
the association has not been interested in detail for the financial burden , so important is only the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when he took an official investigations for abuse of authority , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association account .
these have been returned , the def@@ endants .
this securities account ran in the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known as a result of the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know how he asked for a long time .
then he said finally , he believed that this is the best for the association .
if something happens to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the pro@@ secutor created in the room .
the co @-@ accused may have been informed , justi@@ fying the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; scr@@ ap@@ ing . &quot;
why pollut@@ ants ? , wanted to know ri@@ ght@@ in and pro@@ secutor .
the first def@@ endant , he did not agree with this formulation , since the association had never been created .
but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally said the function@@ ary he never referred to a cent salary , he only reck@@ ons mi@@ leage and di@@ eting .
at Di@@ et , he has questioned the association € 1,000 per month ; however , the actual effort would have been much higher , he added .
accurate documents for the early years could not be submitted .
these are according to a holding check , in which everything has been judged correct , no longer kept , they declared .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard notes additional 30,000 jobs
in addition to for the last three years of ongoing recruitment , the computer esis will build more jobs when joining the company .
the inc@@ iner@@ aries in the US computer label H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not find an end .
in the context of restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 bodies in its corporate clients .
as a result , costs amount of $ 2.7 billion to be saved ( 2.7 billion euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a total amount of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop off from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years now .
HP received the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 people .

the revenues went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP is responding to a split and massive pitch for change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted only late that customers are buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and always do more business online .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence broke out to Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part at the Ser@@ b border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water lights against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has seen the outbreak of violence at the border control centre .
he told us :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
it had formed a police line and behind the poli@@ cem@@ an was prepared a water light .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw the officials with stones , sticks and plastic bottles .
the officials abandoned first un@@ interrup@@ ting pepper .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ a .
a lot of Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees now waited a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had j@@ umped in the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ as , cried .
other refugees participate in them and suffered under air@@ strikes .
also the secretary of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ a and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. banknotes
the world ob@@ serves , when the U.S. banknotes has come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade will have the interest rates down or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists that were interviewed by Re@@ uters , the F@@ ed began to do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates will keep at the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since its F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a big central bank may possibly leave the zero @-@ range and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ turer , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 21.@@ 00 CET on Thursday .
death B@@ alo@@ e on the Delta State University leaving the debt relief
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi in the Monday morning - and before he later he killed his colleagues - Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he , lec@@ turer for geography and social @-@ scientific formation at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and he said , he shot up on someone and killed someone .
he told the staff of the emergency centre that police officers must send their home to police officers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , which will never bother him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers to his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
he was no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ mi , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted it to go one .
I loved Amy , she is the only woman she ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday night when police officers took him around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university @-@ president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ole &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , he believed that Pr@@ er@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ er@@ ss were named Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she were about seven years married when a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two retired two years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ er@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ison and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ er@@ ss worked online from home , after statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ er@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ er@@ ss that had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said he was called a relative at a given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he won &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when police cr@@ ush him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later this night he drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
he received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 as his li@@ feb@@ lood on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their stroke of luck
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stressful years .
in 2001 it fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his many years of partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was condemned because of drug law .
all that calls for sure its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a big concert in concert .
the Lufthansa Group in 2014 is aiming to save a half billion euros a year alone .
150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the workplace out of work .
with the pilot &apos;s union , there is no new negotiation .
the Lufthansa builds on its corporate structure to enhance the low cost @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the target of real@@ ignment is an contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and rede@@ em@@ powered , the airline issued on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board for the Lufthansa in future for the passenger .
the cheap Euro@@ wings sol@@ le should therefore be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
at the board team led by Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , the Karl @-@ Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future .
the new show highlights the significance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet in the future .
the organization of 120@@ ,000 employees has now been complex .
the airline company operated under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , which places three quarters of annual sales of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective @-@ hand with the squ@@ ad @-@ cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) the talks are to be resum@@ ed after the straigh@@ tened strike at this Thursday .
the shared the union with them .
the topic of talks should be the resting place for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come to a predicted result in a year with a predicted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record result &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the Air@@ line led to a number of strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background is next to the transitional provision of the pilots the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it appears that the Lufthansa jumps in the fight against competitors journeys to the corporate headquarters of Euro@@ wings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dawn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are paintings of Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger at the artist &apos;s house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Finn@@ s resident in Gött@@ ingen , Germany , has compiled a selection of tit@@ ell@@ os@@ er works for the general public hall of the house which anim@@ ate their viewers to travel on journey .
Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play Mon@@ days for double @-@ sided frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , a double vocation of his right B@@ one .
while this leaves the left margin to tears and exclude it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was collap@@ sed in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in nine minutes on the playing field , and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a dual balance of power and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then I have operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very difficult and then fantastic playing , and then that happens .
in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double vocation , then it will take six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of a misery .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alize the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspect that the Italian refer@@ ee had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ z and a red card needed .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how cap@@ ut I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;ll get stronger again . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the England al De@@ fen@@ ders has an added incentive to recover from the European Championship in France up to the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves room with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno ser@@ suffered a leg off , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to inj@@ ure the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very badly with it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : when your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost automatically .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to mention his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister decided to The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ established environmental He@@ at from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it has been a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and having a powerful message , it is a book I would like to read my children because it seems to always have missed a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything beautiful and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron refers to the action of the book , describes instead a description of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the Mau@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl from Au@@ dre@@ y , greeting him . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was born and the 1991 died , however completely unknown .
as if that were not suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron presented in part such as the abstract of the Lor@@ ax film , where everything is artificial and even the air is a good , hopes a boy named Ted , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ bable that Cameron is going to become so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ predicted boy , like the local environment through the c@@ ash@@ able Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ wit@@ ched , car@@ ur@@ ous acts , &quot; which is called &apos; devast@@ ated in the name of trees .
most likely , such a relatively low PR function was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax only 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing Street @-@ spokes@@ person said that the text is likely to come by Cameron &apos;s election state .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text by Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expulsion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but when you selected the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ bar@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry a s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mor@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
her@@ on @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th is depar@@ ting from the England test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ alen .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is out of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult circumstances , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ book is focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best pick @-@ up .
a long time ago , it could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not receive such good performances , and that struck me not : he is above all a team man .
the question , how much time a test war@@ man receives in order to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son prior to him - while Nick Comp@@ ton finished nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can collect was that England was first put in the Caribbean in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance lies now in the past .
Alex H@@ alen comes in , and he is a war@@ man that I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket@@ Guide , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he had 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge spot , which met us very much .
he must at least get the same chances before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to hit Mor@@ een in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and got four Qui@@ cks , pi@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stri@@ ker cannot strike there , and these left @-@ handed people have already shown that he is a vi@@ cious of cri@@ cket player .
Mor@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is a number one for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he performed in 2001 as a opening .
he has made three hundred cents immediately and looked back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as an back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him , he very impressed me as a young man .
people may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the rac@@ quet and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there is no large number of back@@ ups to raise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela May@@ awar@@ m , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use on the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach ; and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously mentioned .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not use at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ dex and team controllers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that like players will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made with light heart .
the Bre@@ xit bearing ( Bre@@ xit = exit from Britain from the EU ) could attract the best if the economy falls into a folded device by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ prepared new strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into difficulties each day , even without the choice of in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y , &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour and TU@@ C , who fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel F@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at and said recently that some member states are so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in different crises , as the EU has now been and not always out of its own debt , the Great Britain itself has created the agenda with embro@@ i@@ dered concessions and disturbing agreements which they usually do not wish to fill .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Lost Agenda .
prime minister and Finance minister have climbing at summit or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will gain allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who is looking for a great Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and have reached that more and more short @-@ sighted Minister and officials to come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s war@@ med down chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it is bad for her , as it is bad for the exaggerated per@@ sever@@ ing such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look at his election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a blind@@ ing force .
Poland perhaps soon has a nationalist political government , Spain a left @-@ wing .
it is hard to imagine that she can pick up a leg to prevent the Sel@@ fie of Ireland , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland leaving Australia from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
hence , perhaps some such ministers could possibly not find useful comments , quite in SN@@ Ps style , throughout the SN@@ Ps and start @-@ up in 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend is supposed to accelerate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t have won anything of the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be their own expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press , but did not have been supported by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s referendum in 1975 , but did not support our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are weak to recall with Boris Johnson , the euro @-@ euro Opport@@ un@@ ists who made a name for himself as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his inter@@ mission , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this includes the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ enden sli@@ ders and the pseudo @-@ In@@ states that most of our major newspapers have .
actually , Tony Blair was similar to her , but found that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are spread better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ aner than Blair itself , as he had opposed himself by Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Blair had turned down the principle of the EU adopted in 2005 , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it with a back@@ door .
the press has never abandoned it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me back on Monday in Westminster , gave him a friendly sla@@ p on the back - I told him that he won &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ he years to repeat , an error at that time and today .
it can take up , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC as he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I like to express it in a friendly manner - in development .
he says we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
well , most people out of the U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arization trend and their wil@@ der profile of go@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may everyone to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and on TV this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in it , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ te appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father made himself effort to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet office .
help &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and members according to all reports on their Kl@@ aus@@ age on Monday .
whatever the touching @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n does - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of Social Media , a breeding centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it is right , Cameron does not give free admission to Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the Cur@@ ren@@ ess campaign for natur@@ al@@ ness , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins probably thinks so .

experts report the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded company that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose out of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et , joining the Public Health England ( phe ) critic@@ ise their report on e @-@ cigarettes used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; phic published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month has attacked the &quot; extra@@ y foundation &quot; on which the self employed its most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have wondered whether the alleg@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of phe that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed evaluation of follow @-@ up and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ subject ent@@ decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of different nicotine inhal@@ ed products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor for the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose executive director had previously received its CEO of British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes maker but not the funding , which he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but this includes several known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons which some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
several other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco pipe took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most of the products on most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the phic report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of phic that &quot; there has so far no evidence exists that e @-@ cigarettes can serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Wellness at phe , said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acted .
he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifetime smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are minor but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
furthermore , an un@@ ambiguous obligation to inform the public about what has been eviden@@ ced by evidence and what is not , above all when there are so many public confusion about relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people are dying every year to a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system two billion £ a year .
by clear screening of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fees should only be used to make the type of programmes that is not sent by other UK broadcast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly viewed by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson , that he tried to get in touch with the BBC , six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf of and sends , who were also clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communic@@ ations Committee under its investigation on the future of BBC .
if you want to keep the circuit fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least make its production at least on programs , the others do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s naturally nonsense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive financial programme is financed , which might be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly both original production .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I need to see myself how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a contractor for series , of channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for evaluations &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will announce what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , proposed that the BBC shows how East@@ S@@ ders should sell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal schemes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where pretty much the audience can &apos;t measure , but they perform their tasks and they can argue if they have created all these ob@@ scure Programme which no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them into a window in which no man ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the Rund@@ funk , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call upon you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for those who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To inform and entertain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said there was 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on the radio - and it should be adapted to the public @-@ legal broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are being shown and speaking with the commercial counterparts to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Other Game &apos; can control brain cells through sound@@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ o change the direction in the moment they show with sound impul@@ sive impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerv@@ ousness , which can be controlled by viol@@ ins of sound@@ waves .
the tiny Nem@@ o changes the direction of the moment in which they have to be heard with sound impul@@ sive , which have to be heard for the human hearing on high frequencies .
the impulses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers told the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics , in the ultr@@ as@@ ound diagnosis , to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain , an invasive procedure , electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ o@@ sts do not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , increase the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which then inv@@ ade into the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultr@@ as@@ ound inhibit@@ ors work on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ icons and in the membran@@ es are found by some of the thro@@ ws cells .
the sound@@ waves give the opening of these icon channels and activate the cells in which they are assigned , such as a Review Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound det@@ ective Nem@@ ato@@ lia , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ oring TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels carry .
when it addresses ultr@@ as@@ ound among the changed creatures , the sound@@ waves are reinforced through the micro@@ bes and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed motorbike phones .
the procedure has some similarities with lenses , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientists enables to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be shipped to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves can happen un@@ inhi@@ bited and can be sent in the brain on top of the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ eli@@ ous corporate inheritance , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the appearance of bright colours and animation it remains more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence
eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still in the faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have angry - and in numerous , slow complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the student residence halls varies from light @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely da@@ unting .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ unt : people tell you where you come , whether and where you are Sab@@ bat@@ ate , where you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ te and why you &apos;re not honest Mar@@ m@@ ite not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a ho@@ of ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - asking questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you figure out people who like you may contrary to those you would not speak , even if your lashes would be fl@@ elling and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are pulling and wear their under@@ wear .
based on this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
inser@@ ts received a gro@@ ove treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ory form a space @-@ to @-@ room be@@ um@@ mel culture which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be Hell for someone who tries to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate himself .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship ahead , but you have to go away so I get back the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ eh@@ one is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of adding .
apro@@ pos t@@ apping : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a not dev@@ out door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of Back Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imag@@ ining himself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked a bit . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
making homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain themselves and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends if you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly missed cl@@ ots made of flour , sugar and fat make people sle@@ ep@@ ing@@ y when you b@@ link .
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime of student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking the taking of a drop of fruit for your tea also ?
check the with the dairy owner .
the chances are good , they say themselves to operate themselves , even if they bo@@ il up in the inner .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it balanced as my ten@@ ant , who added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make a noise , stopping people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who are sitting in the Glass House .
a girl on my hallway asked her neighbors , if there was something to be qui@@ eter , Drum &amp; bass something qui@@ eter , since it &apos;s 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to this with older music .
when they had heard about 5 pm , they let their neighbours sleep again two hours before they left their own music , shut their door and ended up at her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would happen to be within the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely it would not be ab@@ y@@ ard@@ ent , if you have a room@@ mate for your future couple , to join it , then separate yourself and then experience it every day and maybe experience how they transfer all common friends to you ?
of course , the heart goes your own paths - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try to talk at least , your sub@@ womb a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has left his keys in his un@@ covered room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is f@@ ain@@ ly as it seems .
a good track is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never ch@@ ew one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then put in the freezer - but then put your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , solo Rec@@ ur@@ ners , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ages
the real estate @-@ business unit Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medium @-@ established Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , for refugees - but also as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need space foam , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners who are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can still build a cheap and well @-@ off today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the residential market .
the entrepreneur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly a living space can be created : it builds houses in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ a , many refugees will be pushed to the residential market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass of mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in the face of the refugee flow , we need plenty of living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ a : an town@@ house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
that is different when the people are sitting in living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to the individual needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ a : the price of 160 square meters of living space is € 18@@ 4 000 , without plot .
this is clearly visible .
six months has taken the building lasted .
this is reasonable .
did the construction work concep@@ tu@@ betra@@ y their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ a : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated it makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ y special structure and the space @-@ space requirements .
dirty .
it is still sitting down , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities no space is missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents respond to their Town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ a : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but shar@@ ps not the competitive battle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ a : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built in modern apartments , which hardly can afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal human beings need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ alone mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner @-@ serving .
I show how one can now build a cheap and good place today .
that is what we are about .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS system when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are encountered after installation on issues , since they get an error message , which communic@@ ates that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the delete of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made it more likely through the mer@@ ging of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process has been completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the phone may be dis@@ connected to halfway and this could lead to a crash of the updates .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the chess club , founded three months ago , &quot; Gat@@ ew@@ er Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has added another member in his ranks , so the membership figures on 19 players grew .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held out more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen for cure .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the vehicle of the federal government with first class and hon@@ orary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation who took the chairman of Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to host chess players , who cannot release the membership fee .
youth work and talent is also to be acc@@ ented .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also in the relationship to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ tedness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ office is looking for direct contact
S@@ alu@@ d and the Alten@@ center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces at the Mant@@ le of the Socialist Foundation and opened a new radius at the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ square .
besides deliber@@ ations , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation down the hill to the city center .
exactly said at the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
there a new qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ ery was recently opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you can immediately receive seniors and advice @-@ seeking information on issues such as foster insurance or medical care and nursing services .
for years we have established care service with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; we are not rarely accepted too many achievements of the insur@@ ers , because the complexity of insur@@ ers is hardly still understood , &quot; explained the new landlord in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot;
beside the deliber@@ ations , the new lodging community also offers prevention , health and wellness .
here the S@@ alu@@ d was taken with the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as pet@@ ting prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy .
the offers of the retirement age and the S@@ alu@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
S@@ alu@@ stra@@ dis is for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior age for care and care , &quot; described Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , manager of S@@ alu@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new fiscal office in the downtown you can see both business leaders especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the various neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the opening ceremony , wid@@ ows himself to the harmon@@ isation office at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alising service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the social foundation to make a great contribution that senior citizens can live on their own and well in their trusted surroundings .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to noon .

Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L .
in addition , Sam@@ et@@ u@@ dig@@ al meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Cooperation in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert are pleased .
in many places on the country physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ y@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ow@@ ausen was reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing at a side with his successor over the next few months .
after a construction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he is investing € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises near the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
furthermore , sympathy extends to the first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship of years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met , who currently completed their specialist services in the den@@ dener Hospital and who also wants to get into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the mosquitoes would fit well in this practice , &quot; Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ y@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when I was ready I simply wanted them to . &quot;
the couple of Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families through the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also wants to be his own boss soon .

the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ ac@@ ces wish to settle for as car@@ et@@ in@@ aries .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the reconstruction the rooms will be modern look .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load @-@ EK@@ gs and need a mobile @-@ room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
an allowance of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro are provided by the Mü@@ llers within the framework of a funding programme by the District of the District ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is being proce@@ eded , &quot; adds Vel@@ t@@ consult@@ ative Master Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ y@@ ausen , in the North @-@ German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner &apos;s office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice proceeds by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ y@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
those who visit Mü@@ llers are attended , by the way continues to see mostly in familiar faces : assumes the seven medical experts and the cleaning power of the ri@@ al .
the farewell ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ se@@ en over@@ threw .
a little sad@@ ness feel a feel after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live on in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will still see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband added l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter @-@ plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed myself before gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travelled about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also highly driven on our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the controls on the Hungarian border remain erect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application can do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people stood in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should also be clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , also not about the Austrian Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is sha@@ ked &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had previously announced to continue traveling to Slovenia &apos;s forthcoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances causing cor@@ ridors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so , this was not the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather intensify the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary - &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the external boundary of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to have its limits to refugees but not inter@@ locking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees would have tried to pass during the night hours on Tuesday to pass in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to ev@@ ade the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet police @-@ vehicles with new refugees ever .
it is primarily Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
new life@@ services , and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the days ahead , his country began with approximately 4000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo brought to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had so far pushed migrants to the Hungarian border , leading to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade qu@@ ends that it is to introduce people to set certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , anyway in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , further buses would expect further buses .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were all night away from the distant mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
as a result , it could now actually rise to the predicted shift in the past Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong up@@ stream of refugees with appropriate plans for possible conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it but pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for limiting control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007 , and has since consistently been a good witness to the country , as regards the standards of border controls .
on the b@@ b@@ ish side behind the Hungarian border fence around 300 refugees continue to be stuck .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s media they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ ego that leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ ego and Back@@ bur@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm down on Wednesday at a local currency in Hy@@ gos : he will hold the debates on alternative routes to refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast .
it would not be at the moment not to pay great refugees .
you can &apos;t even tell if they would continue their trip via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers of migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee helmet has already begun to distribute the refugee cards on which alternative routes are shown by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border @-@ area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still not cleared .
on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police declared that a team of de@@ mining was sent in the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukrainian people pay 30 million dollars
sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is alleged to have been a ring of cy@@ ber @-@ criminal investigations , which has been dis@@ car@@ ded since 2010 again into an un@@ released financial statements and press releases on sites such as business Wire , marketing , red and PR news wire .
with the exploited information , in@@ sider shops should be made in the financial markets .
a total of over 100 million dollars were launched in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately locked in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other def@@ endants in the event continued .
most of the def@@ endants were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are supposed to have been active in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ um Mannheim has been operating for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is active pi@@ cks .
the people get their concerns , some quick pac@@ em@@ aker , some very cozy bu@@ mm@@ ed .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons on the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

vibrant , pr@@ istine life with stunning autumn shine and middle rin four big boards each with the heading &quot; Be@@ fore I die @-@ be , I would be ... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ aid made this action attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is definitely confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the midst of the city and among people &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the leadership of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ tee is also available for questions and discussions as volunteers , as well as volunteers .
while some fits spontaneously for chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the proposition to &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer &quot; , others are briefly standing , read , say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again , on the ver@@ ge , little discussions on the action develops about the life , the way of dealing with the death .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only when I make it clear , that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the di@@ ak@@ onic artwork of Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ aid .
therefore , this public &apos;s effective promotion is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
if not everyone wants to communicate openly to the table , though , be understandable , finally , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and dying still is frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jose@@ fine lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ it@@ ant movement has contributed much to the recent years that people open themselves .
an assessment that divi@@ des Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
die Ster@@ be@@ - und O@@ bit@@ u@@ tion@@ ers is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
by personal experience with the issue , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in dying aid .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ aster had been looking for volunteers , immediately reported it and was in the beginning of the year 1995 .
Go@@ hearty ro@@ id is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the insured and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hosp@@ ice @-@ Saint @-@ Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ al ro@@ id can handle well with its task and the experiences made and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point of view , consider it precious and cher@@ ish the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hospital service is free of charge and subject to sec@@ t@@ arian .
the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations enable training as well as further training and super@@ visions of the stars and ob@@ itu@@ des .
every two years training courses for new employees are offered .
the tablets described on Saturday are now issued in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) , and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
in addition , other personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , Finance @-@ prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint results for the final quarter , and the Lie@@ fer Gig@@ ant reports his winner view of a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in their bo@@ d@@ transport service .
the company also said that she plans to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would prefer to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation time .
the share fell by 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents lower than in previous pre@@ diction .
analysts expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the reduced view comes in spite of the price increase , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent on the 4th of January and , despite higher rainf@@ all are expected for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that will be charged in November .
the company said it would nonetheless be expecting the result from the previous year due to cost @-@ reduction , higher income and because of growth in online commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; solid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the ri@@ vals U@@ PS , which plans to cease 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex has served as well as 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year .
the result per share amoun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44@@ 35 per share , which predicted 12 of Z@@ acks Investment Research surve@@ yed .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked the analy@@ st expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in recent years in the international market of safety , which st@@ agn@@ ate sales in his unit Express des@@ patch .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales in bo@@ ating transfer rose by 29 per cent in the final quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result sank in the cargo business due to higher labour costs .
in Pre@@ market Trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , it concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at their most expected meeting in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ es spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide if it &apos;s time to elev@@ ate the benchmark for the first time since almost a decade .
threats about them at an end of the dealt , two @-@ story sitting room , is a m@@ ural on the wall of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maximize U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there are an un@@ trained third @-@ mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in deciding which is too narrow to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented margin of interest since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows sound , the latest turmoil in the global financial markets do the already cautious F@@ ed representatives to intensify this volati@@ lity in the interest rate for the federal government - and be it just about one quarter of percentage .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first instance will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Chief econom@@ ist in the broker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase interest rate , the increased insecurity around the global market has had enough justification , further to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which prohi@@ ass@@ ures the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted a Zin@@ o increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect a lowering of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists stop the blow , by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was worth 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week of sustain@@ ing , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief of the Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she should go very far in her explanation for re@@ assure the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a Zin@@ c raise will put down the financial markets , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set about 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in slow t@@ apping of the mon@@ astic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that , in spite of the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , that it would be necessary more economic progress , an increase in the sentence .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than 7 years and close to the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage conclusions have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually passed under the average goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ feder@@ kon@@ om in Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets picked up all over the world at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued his currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was growing in May by more than 16 % below its peak , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy was th@@ rot@@ tle the global growth rate .
the market has recovered a little this month , whereby the Dow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influences the complex calculation , when interest should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy has not occurred in the past couple of weeks , they would closely attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and the former Staff of the U.S. Bank Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects more manage@@ able .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , which is why they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed currency organization of the world .
the impact of the central bank has changed enormously in recent years .
the mere reference of the then Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; del@@ etes round the globe round the globe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , they can monitor the developments in other areas , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to the financial market movements that apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ alist data . &quot;
L@@ acker , a particip@@ atory member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a p@@ inn@@ ess increase , zi@@ pped decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its conduc@@ tivity at 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three meetings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite unlimited impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives continued these cuts .
the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 Mark@@ ol@@ a@@ 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest of interest of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence were not close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to be in the situation in which she brought fear of a Zin@@ c increase , because the markets are off , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should spare time to time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
having a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there is a whole bunch of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ enses , they still have to deal with .
every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seeker at the D@@ ill@@ inger road .
here she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite a different instruction than at the right school .
Brazi@@ li@@ ens pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS tried to elu@@ ci@@ date the sho@@ cking way women on how important good nutrition during breastfeeding is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new researchers suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary custom@@ ization that should be made as mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in fact protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an unhealthy eating of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal office Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euros of sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ looking turn@@ around in the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting the performed construction program was agreed without large discussions without large discussions .
in addition , the Panel among other things had decided to apply a request for a further legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of the valid buildings .
with the &quot; exception &quot; this was the permission to use a special form regarding the umbrella construction .
according to this , a &quot; Satt@@ el@@ d@@ ach &quot; should be built with non @-@ mit@@ one First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof for solar power systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore we get a wonderfully large South Moravian together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again focuss@@ ed on the genesis , which is for energy reasons - different from the development plan - to be among ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore needed because the development plan does not allow &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der &apos;s council is not down@@ lighted in the rule with deliver@@ ance claims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ outs of the project is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not creating a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around in the Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the cost of around 2.3 million euros is calculated .
grants are expected from the school and grass@@ roots promotion .
in the next process , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres high hall now has been submitted to the Senate Committee for testing .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is intended to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new Doc@@ tor Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with direction to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seeing the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court in front of , the Land@@ en@@ ologist Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites himself .
a decision regarding the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ da@@ w@@ ning on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to be working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
most of the vast majority should be mig@@ rated with fishermen and the farther inland station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are available .
the collaborators who do not go to Sh@@ ong@@ au will be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim a place where Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the staff are informed about the plans .
triggered by the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only the first @-@ beginning medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the start and is now switching to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
in the question of who the succession is scheduled , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , which was prepared to take over the direction of 1 October , and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in any case the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au used this in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ valuation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner court of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agree to agree to both homes , until then in the next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the circuit has been planned for 2018 , if the current development is currently being completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
Land@@ rä@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came out against which the House , which is owned by the federal union , in future will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; the end I came out . &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites could not say there are several reflections .
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ house .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ve to Le@@ ch , who has been treated well by the employees &quot; positive and understanding . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which has been working in the fishermen for over 30 years , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take charge of the post of medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened over time over the past decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ etri@@ cs .

refugees need accommodation : study warning about apartment gap
the location on the German apartment market is tense .
there are more and more refugees trying to pay a paid place .
pressure on the residential market continues .
social housing is facing a challenge .
trade battles on the German residential market have long since started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing on a market that is already now relie@@ ved in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compete with income @-@ weak citizens about the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , there would have to be 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this outcome , a study comes on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work of the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year they are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units completed in Germany .
thus they lack 140@@ ,000 homes .
refugees are not ple@@ dged after the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers in a first @-@ setting accommodation .
many come across the residential market and turn into the long queu@@ es in front of the flats .
according to statistics of statistics last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers had to rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market lie not only at the rising of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany sho@@ ots a housing deficit prior to her that increases from year to year .
currently they have met about 7@@ 7@@ 0.000 dwelling units , laments Matthias Günther , author of the study .
most of the work we spent in big cities not@@ ched in WG rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tarily because of the foot@@ ed on the apartment market for a longer time in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per capita in recent years has dropped once more .
to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; social housing &apos; is propos@@ ing a new start .
the new incentives for social housing should be rest@@ led again .
thus could be disp@@ ens@@ ed to the Gr@@ under@@ dogs tax and the base tax for sponsored apartments are exposed and exposed .
moreover , according to the Alliance , attractive tax schemes are necessary .
the support programme for refugee information on the Swiss bank Kf@@ W is now well attended in towns and villages .
a good week after the start took place on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million euros more than half the amount has been retri@@ ev@@ ed around 300 million euros .
now , the project could even be increased .
refugees have free transit : Croatia and Slovenia are dealing with each other
after Hungary there is practically no getting around , there are more refugees trying to reach the road over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous is the route yet .
Croatia wants to negotiate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior Minister , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already owned by the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people were come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik , reports on the Croatian tel@@ eno@@ on RT@@ L .
Hungary had been torn down on the day before its border for refugees .
new laws which appeared in force on the same day , make all of the ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had seized the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the Croatian border in Croatia in the morning .
the mainstream media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived in both the bus and the Ta@@ xen border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after they arrived , they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
however , on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
to do this , the bor@@ ro@@ bin holds other dangers : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian Civil War in the 1990s .
min@@ ers are to now quickly create a secure passage .
after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 @-@ numbered people .
shortly before the gate on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian Law@@ s , the overcoming and damaging the border tell us as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were therefore introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sentenced to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment up to five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the immigration office , on Tuesday , on Tuesday , in the new borders of the &quot; Tran@@ sp@@ as &quot; , there were a total of 94 asylum seekers , including almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
at the Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees trying to take hold .
but practically nobody has granted a prospect in Hungary for asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the ar@@ ical view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distr@@ acted asylum seekers should be moved there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered together only a few hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to regulate their workers .
they gathered the trash , leaving the tens of thousands of people over the streets past several weeks .
the ne@@ f@@ ences were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camp in the bor@@ der@@ ort was changed .
to the aim of this conversion , nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria can be reached after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants stopped after government statements but still in the country .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the return to Germany .
the rail transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by request of German authorities .
in Shi@@ mano we met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor conducted &quot; crossing the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were at the entrance hall on Sunday with the bur@@ dock , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly with a surprise for Germany on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in Wern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; the coun@@ t@@ ler that immediately offered his help and cut the cars along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Near East .
before we made the un@@ hoped guest only once , with j@@ ause and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; says coun@@ t@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grateful .
a man wouldn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for fire@@ men .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ th@@ ler .
the squ@@ ander@@ ed passengers had risen from the Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , after the short notice of the pro@@ clamation that the railway traffic was set to Germany but still trying to cross the border .
however , the regional train was placed in the Wern@@ stein am Inn in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before , a semi @-@ fer@@ vent - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sending hundreds of tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a sha@@ ded policy :
instead of helping in the warehouse of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the construction of structures , our German Chancellor continued to be highly officially recognised and publicly launched by the government position of the Hungarian government in the sovereign district of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the whis@@ pered will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome has nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge facing the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , with us to establish decent states of protection .
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ y quarters
finally Conrad has the hand to do all hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is it used that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ffe@@ isen bank , to set the arti@@ facts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the Fir@@ st@@ kirchen @-@ Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been opened in the grasp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported by his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Conrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interior of the Ministry spoke of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ ative situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall Conrad has been calculated with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the He@@ ur@@ passed year .
in order to meet the number , over the next few weeks will have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 h the Bund .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a f@@ ass without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Conrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor he has already taken hold of talks .
they could have ensured , even for the upcoming refugees of neighbour@@ hoods .
&quot; in Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ born , who will be elu@@ ci@@ dated as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations uses the asylum Co@@ ordinator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ pers as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform you can offer smart people uncomplicated accommodation .
additionally , one hopes on hotels that are empty during the winter .
finally Conrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it can not be that you have to have a certain height of the towel or size of the so@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not@@ ing must be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in opposition to the Interior Ministry , he was more successful in the establishment of his experience , Conrad with his experience .
I am a older Lord , who cannot be said without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally Conrad and Mai@@ er did not cause the Republic as they declared themselves .
your employees want to increase them on three to four .
the company &apos;s own search has so far not been successful .
finally Conrad wanted to establish a container at the square Stephan@@ splatz .
but obviously , there are apparently issues with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
at the moment , there is no opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the people are currently able to place it without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , further sites should be checked for sc@@ uba diving as well .
criticism of the city of refugees in the division of refugees within the Federal Republic .
also other districts must make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; limits are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister , Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ er ( VP ) gave more action on Monday for further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German limits are not sealed off .
the travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
wai@@ ves with refugees to Germany will not be able to give birth to any more .
however , the keen eye would have brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ er once more called for more solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that the controls are now also reflected in the border controls , is a logical consequence &quot; of the action of Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Sea line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T network , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative businesses from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later to variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which precip@@ itation promised a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.@@ 4.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Confederation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent do not give it requests .

this project had to dis@@ continued the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old inc@@ it@@ ress of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ern market Arctic : finally , it has now also got an increase in the shape of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop towards the shop , in which they sold under others bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clo@@ g of different manufacturers , now everything about Dam@@ en@@ handmade bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting from 75 Euro .
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks has been modified .
&quot; I have a long time over whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says broadly .
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a private location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the sav@@ age in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has its own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has placed wide from her mother to the cradle .
I emerged when something develops and I can show new trends at a performance price .
why so some woman with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in timi@@ be de@@ vic@@ timi@@ d , the specialist can not answer with the last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded to any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ town
the Pf@@ el@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called a gi@@ ver .
this feature combines man@@ cher also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US President wants to become .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for offset .
whether he is alien@@ ated against xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalist or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office will be power@@ fully assembled .
and he cuts well off .
this is also recorded in the I@@ vor@@ ian K@@ all@@ town , where the grandparents of the property milli@@ ard .
the New Yorker with the fishing float is a term for many in the wine village at the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is about -@@ ump@@ corners with it related .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pf@@ alz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villagers think about his aim to become em@@ powered man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in her K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the site and its famous det@@ achments to which besides Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too - with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ town .
to the king of the heart , he did not bring it there .
although there is respect for the achievement of the family , but I also reck@@ oned that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a p@@ inning , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accidental the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the District &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - for High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus from the village of An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gol@@ dig@@ gers .
foundations of the real estate corporation were first property purchases in New York .
but the life of his grandparents was not free from tragedy : her desire to return on a long run to the homeland , failed to the Bav@@ arian State to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once completed without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Volk@@ sk@@ id , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is a contrast to the em@@ bodied statements by the neighbour .
he had repeatedly talked about the Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter@@ red illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ tered , this is not so person@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a far removed family ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born st@@ mp , the op@@ a was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement see the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so pi@@ qu@@ ished . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension sc@@ ant@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit to the church or@@ gel sp@@ ended , what came across well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it makes it better if he doesn &apos;t win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ dd@@ ler Sarah stages .
and as a president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for the Tru@@ mp has been interviewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 m@@ ists , also in the USA awake the interest .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in the Today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson is sent to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but no major shifts are provided for today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of Nine was aired by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ with the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , st@@ em@@ med in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun .
this drawback of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise above 39@@ ,000 spectators were generated in five main cities compared with today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase from the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap of Sun@@ rise has been closed in the last months .
in August Today on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ 0.000 from Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year there was a gap between 40,000 and 50,000 people .
so far in September Sun@@ rise is on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 audi@@ ts to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 by today .
this is the most interesting what happened every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have been un@@ know@@ ingly expos@@ ing who The Bachelor is gaining .
the woman , at which Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally landed , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girl will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we went with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows the day before out of three two , you might have accidentally given an indication of who the winners will be .
Sam Wood continues its lips to the final on Thursday final
all three women have let themselves out in ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should be Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become corrupt who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ens @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki urge both of them - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one simple relationship with each other from the first day on .
&quot; from the moment I walked into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ i energies noted , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the proper chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam is well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man @-@ visit last week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that wood is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is performed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after having moved to the US - and there were many other teams , which were sent out after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ n chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
some coaches would have banned from Hay@@ n for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a t@@ angel as he did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League , when his first Pun@@ t returns on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ n the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t Return and also in the ongoing play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its authentic face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ating his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ek in his press conference in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialty pharmaceutical coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who invited him to forget his de@@ ple@@ ted f@@ ang and worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented in a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ es and his massive Australian ge@@ ographies had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ n left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ .@@ 10@@ 4.1 that he could not picture a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was an thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that is , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ d@@ ow@@ es the car@@ vers with his Ori@@ gin Symphony at that time in 2007 , when a passport was in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a wonderful experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free vot@@ er demand for the high refugees paying the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader of Hubert Hor@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W fall in Grand Wal@@ den in front of a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns Schulen , when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools prior to h@@ aps , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get audi@@ ts at the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the free voters were cancelled up to Friday in the sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ative commune .
actually there were completely different main topics .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the issue for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is super@@ imposed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia in the nin@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers do not want to de@@ duct the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative procedures responsible for asylum systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least fifty new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states don &apos;t be consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern sho@@ cks , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the federal government in the big @-@ ot town should not fall under the table .
a years of long @-@ per@@ ishing bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ age Minister Ludwig Re@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started off the pilot @-@ trial ( CS@@ U ) , where an extension of the early intermediate level will be tested for three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to SL@@ C .
but this is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums they want .

a lot of stock si@@ ans expect that markets to be paid up after the interest rate in the US and to the big decline in the stock exchange will occur on this Friday .
the discussion around the bur@@ dens resulting from the nuclear phase won the shares of R@@ WE in a record low @-@ time , and left deep traces on eon .
according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; to the German energy @-@ teeth , some 30 billion euros are lacking in terms of appropri@@ ations .
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered , but ultimately got lost to 3.@@ 31 per cent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) .

4 people killed after police rubber bu@@ g@@ utter on demonstrators in Nepal shooting
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nep@@ alese after the police were ra@@ gged into a crowd coming against the proposed new constitution said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , guiding district government , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr Reh@@ o@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ a and then shot up into the air before it pushed back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets of which is known to kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the argument was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ dar@@ i say that new provinces to be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ u who want to create their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent conflict since the 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement that divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very cont@@ entious issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally .
the work on a new constitution had been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process of the devastating earthquake that killed in April thousands of people .
the legislation voted for this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the estate at the em@@ blem of the Old Post is to be built again .
the city currently prepares everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
there is a mixture of trade , commerce and housing - there are no concrete proposals yet .
Em@@ den - the city of Em@@ den wants to market a roughly 4,000 square meter property in direct proximity to the youth center Alte post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
we plan to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , meaning it from the city .
which property should arise , be not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were signed .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner Great street , bought some months ago and let it rest well @-@ located building .
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the Plan@@ es for holiday house settlement at the Little Sea at Em@@ den takes shape .
the investor first presented publicly plans for the project .
several tut@@ ors are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure time
Mon@@ el@@ ang had been negotiated behind closed doors , sha@@ king , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday house at the Little Sea are near by Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ der , &quot; System @-@ construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night .
it was initially connected to the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , the recru@@ iting of the investors and the administration of secrecy , Ralf rein@@ forcement von der System @-@ Bau @-@ Management entered the offensive : &quot; we do not yet have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the council and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good , all rum@@ ours can now be able to meet .
the project has been around ten to twelve million Euros and have been in discussion for months .
fierce reactions among the land@@ owners who had come into the meeting were sm@@ elled the pictures and new details for the hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea bu@@ den@@ owner and employee @-@ board of the interests of the dealers , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , that over@@ looks all the other gi@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critics that the traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be all bus stops , so that that counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz
what exactly on the good one h@@ ect@@ are the grand area of the former guest place is , however , is still open .
still there is no operator .
&quot; only must we have established a conclu@@ sive idea , &quot; he said Ralf rein@@ forcement .
because this was still lacking , the development plans are also variable .

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the disclosure of the donations of donations on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled to her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about our journey there were many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .

for slightly overweight Di@@ abe@@ tiker weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who do not receive anti @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , adi@@ posit@@ as operations have proved efficient in the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes though , but most studies have been carried out in people that are path@@ ia @-@ obes@@ e with a Body measure @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in relation to size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that somebody is obes@@ e , and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered a obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ e Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Rule , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity , stomach ul@@ tures and stomach ul@@ cer@@ ation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not receive anti @-@ surgical tick treatments , approximately immediately at 29 .
among those who have undergone a surgical procedure , rede@@ emed at 36 % the diabetes is totally and partially at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared with diabetes , diabetes is fully only at one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group .
the researchers also bla@@ zes the patient @-@ blood levels of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best performed under 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after surgery the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
but in the medical therapy group it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also expects average results with the two types of the surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost much weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and signi@@ fied rather a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subject to obes@@ e people who undergo to an obesity surgery , roughly 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - comparing to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival on surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in that lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with the BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes that have found their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück .
it is a subject that is currently taking place in fiction : a young woman , too un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets up after years the flock of their youth , and this fell in love with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the love story , the novel may also be of interest to H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as it plays in long@@ itu@@ des and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she was able to set her home a literary monument .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader called for violence in the refugees &apos;s home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
in the given circumstances , he called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the west European countries to the refugee crisis has been admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worrying about several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and true development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing will be diminished in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force never solved problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 I had put my che@@ ers in letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this issue lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set power , and this has brought forth unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of hot hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gi@@ fts Control centers in the US report a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low alcoholic dis@@ infection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georgia Po@@ ison Center &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centers , from 3.@@ 26.@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more frequent to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them enter in the emergency &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children inf@@ ect@@ ants can inf@@ ant drink , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ iny among social media .
watch videos on YouTube , how many young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only due to a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to have a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant mixed with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to have a tougher drink .
younger children can be ex@@ iled from attractive d@@ bits of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are lubric@@ ated .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice , which are very appealing for children .
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in case of to@@ dd@@ lers , a few injections may lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison not@@ r@@ ame in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let go p@@ inn@@ ed whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lash of after straw@@ berry cent@@ f@@ ten@@ ders in the school was taken into an emergency reception .
her blood @-@ carbon concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered by an adult legal as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated it at the G@@ win@@ k Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah abo@@ her her words and was not able to walk as she arrived in the ER .
doctors tested them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed the head , said k@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez is recommended to use parents and teachers , use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ are and hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants beyond the reach of the child .
over alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants have been linked to death cases .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of the ham@@ ster dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that had a toxic , non @-@ kl@@ ari@@ ed ingredient .
employee of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which was noted as substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state New York , their &quot; reported &quot; teacher to Po@@ isons , cast their &quot; anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; it was a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
the police considered the failed plan as &quot; guns , &quot; and inter@@ discipl@@ in@@ arity measures to the school authority .

D@@ ons increase leadership via Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season gave super@@ sti@@ tions a short victory over Hamilton in the Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y in Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team origins are not under increased control , since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football @-@ bored rainf@@ all - de Bo@@ er
the former ranking players and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no track ri@@ vals with the ranking .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they did not show highlights of Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the ranking .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old -@@ Fir@@ m games and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I will ro@@ de things around , v@@ ow D@@ ei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Celtic will have to fight but the Norwegian leader sw@@ ells things to turn around .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ Man from Aber@@ deen , who are now standing at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ ei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already gone bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out of it as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need support provided by Celtic because that makes the players better .
being together now is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , whereas the UK is increasing in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period May to July , whereas the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.5 per cent at the age of 5.5 per cent , as indicated the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland increased by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have experienced more improvements on the Scottish labour market , with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is being put to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first introduced in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day closer I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
well , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists should be allowed to see in the United States and there are often more applicants as places available , a flaw@@ less lottery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
who is selected will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot do it .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit in a small friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pin to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants and you will get access .
I felt with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she adm@@ its that she could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses anytime .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
if he die , he thinks that public relations work will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to have a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can turn to .
what you will get by me is what it means to die as a man an unpleasant death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him and thre@@ aten the racing course
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from racing Victoria began to install a sp@@ y in his stables in the past year and re@@ inst@@ ated to finish the race immediately .
he took to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ator Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they have launched a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a racing day treatment until the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ s@@ tasting at Li@@ dar@@ i that he can &apos;t explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage alleg@@ ations , and did not want it to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long spoken to it , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know they are far@@ mer@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take about my main journeys and I want my owners thinking that I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think carefully what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration department has tried to sp@@ y its cow@@ shed .
&quot; just eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I &apos;ll be asked if I asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed to hold me , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , W@@ inn@@ ed . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of it at the time and are still today .
should I bring that to my mind that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave and makes people responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and ch@@ ased me , and I have no doubt that what I say will be considering them now .
but now I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t care , and it makes me sad .
this makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fleet levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by the preparation of the un@@ re@@ ed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , marked the racing day treatment rule &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was imposed on the horse key , which thrust the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistaken mud upon the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
it was also like that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for def@@ ences to E@@ Q@@ ur@@ ae
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy sur@@ faced criticism on the Tac@@ tics of its players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the refer@@ ee will be allowed to compete with his team &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the High Storm Se@@ al in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Ro@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a scar@@ cely move to the Storm team having scored a final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of its team and said that they are concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in their team confident that they were worried , that they were worried about the Storm team to get beaten .
&quot; this emerges naturally and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson have talked about inter @-@ fights , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Alice on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have nothing changed from our defensive system or the techniques . however , in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ cles for a real focus and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is really strange as this is always emerging at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; te@@ dious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soccer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was critici@@ zed as an te@@ dious team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of it .
but now he has a team to play and which we consider as thrilling , in particular his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have these types of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer games - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so you can play them like them .
I &apos;m growing stronger trust because they &apos;re saying these things because they are a bit worried about who to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this a thrilling game ?
or are Pau@@ sen do and have no points a bit of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the road@@ maps .
if they mention here , it means that we will be meeting in a phase still .
the Storm team won free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the finals at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts starting next morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit after drugs
a man who may possibly thre@@ aten a life @-@ long sentence due to its temp@@ s , to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mug@@ gling in Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and moved in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially viable penalty to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in coffee might have been out of a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; stated the court on Wednesday .
with the pen@@ al matter he lied over the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the devast@@ ated explanations of the two people it is clear that the running of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge l@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , announces itself at the police on a daily basis and is at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

two of the three participating trucks had slow@@ ed down in front of a continuous operation in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain , at the last moment to the left to the left as the police rus@@ hed .
the leader of the accident @-@ judgment is completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to ask pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the girl of the girl , when this slept , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing message and aler@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analy@@ sing then computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search of un@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ g@@ g claimed to the officials that he did it , as there would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ secutor E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave that finding on the computer was carried out by him , said it was done to be because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an to frigh@@ ten a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him pictures and asked the he to send even more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said that he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said , he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son said : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and in the crying .
it then saw the un@@ decent photos on the phone and made the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused Computer and Play@@ station took advantage of talking to girls who saw much younger than he .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment of inde@@ cent images of children on 14 June last year and did not viol@@ ate this year to a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defen@@ ders attorney S@@ im asked for the reason that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared as to October , to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted this case , but was arrested in custody for hear@@ ings on the others still in custody .
it was recorded even prior to the date of judgment into the directory of the sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user rests on small border out@@ puts to Germany
more and more refugees are attacked from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tab@@ lo@@ users were out of fear of the discovery and arrest of the people increased in smaller border @-@ borders
on the Austrian side , he said a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police .
along the River Thames , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot across bridges and cross@@ roads to the German side .
they are put forward by Federal Police in the reception and passed on to the registration .
at the Munich railway station , the Federal Police of Munich met a clearly more refugees in the event compared to the weekend of the weekend .
between 8 : 00 a.m. and 8 : 00 p.m. , some 700 people were registered in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of inspections at the German @-@ Austrian border had reached the city on Tuesday of 17@@ 59 refugees .
Stuttgart : junction of trop@@ hi@@ ght &quot; Henry &quot; in the South @-@ West expected
Meteor@@ ologists warn of assault in the south @-@ west of the Mid@@ night afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot water air currently distributed in the country , the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the vigor@@ ous Tie@@ to sei is the prec@@ ursor of the tro@@ ika &quot; Henry , &quot; who in the past few days moved from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic .
fierce storms and thunder@@ showers are expected especially in Baden .
D@@ W@@ D is still till Thursday morning too early in the Black Forest , at the Sch@@ wa@@ vering Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ sea circuit with goats of 60 to 90 k@@ tim@@ etres .
the Sun turns itself more into the sun once more .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show their new products .
2015 is especially active in the compact vehicles that are currently especially well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently especially popular : some 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registrations has fallen by the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is reflected on the IA@@ A ( People &apos;s Day 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , and new luxury cars are presented this year in particular a lot of new models .
one of the biggest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , who will be part of the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; says Opel @-@ CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the show .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order that the volume model is also sold well , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive .
Opel is putting an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in a prospect which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euro .
the A@@ stra provides a new 4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
H@@ esse has more diesel engines and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 HP , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
in contrast to the main competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel A@@ stra is initially only a five @-@ fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible on the IA@@ A .
and what will take place next to the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A still at new comp@@ acts ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault was the fourth generation of its A@@ stra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e show exclusively as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and a keen sporty GT @-@ Version .
in trade it comes to the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance intends to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
here , the compact Infin@@ iti fits with its curved lines fully into the design line .
the base model is awarded a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
but the diesel is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ or and output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is about 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the comp@@ ac@@ t@@ asse@@ model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A .
outside the designer of the ed@@ len Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Able@@ gers was placed in front of all hands at the front@@ partition : here the he@@ at@@ eries was rep@@ ain@@ ted and changed the changed flas@@ h@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , above all the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and the first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play function .
a series of re@@ work and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I will be added at the IA@@ A in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cells are in@@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the Federal Employment Office , which was placed for months in a small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners of principle are entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can even wait for money if they were locked only a few days in the rooms narrow ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , a ex @-@ prisoner with his constitu@@ tion@@ aries in Karlsruhe was successful : he was placed in a single cell separ@@ ating Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel from June to November 2009 in an individual cell of around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not dis@@ connected .
after that , the man , who , according to his attack , had now moved on an open foot into a larger cell .
his term of office for the un@@ worthy trip conditions against the country in Berlin was vain .
but the constitutional re@@ pres@@ ters took the sentence of the chamber of Berlin and rec@@ edes the case for re @-@ examination .
you see the human dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decide on the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons have been decisive for the repar@@ ations for legal reasons not only a few days of o@@ at@@ age for compensation , be a compensation , it was meant .
otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ch@@ illing of the legal safety of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the level of the quot@@ a system .
the constitutional pres@@ u@@ ters often have strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
they said only in April of a prisoner of compensation , because he was bare in a cell .
an@@ un@@ worthy is to make a decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ professional capture of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , with a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 had agreed to in@@ ven@@ ous accommodation .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was stored for three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also taken the headlines in the headlines in recent weeks .
de@@ tain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness only increases , even to r@@ ack@@ down , it is meant to be so because of the tense situation .
according to information of the legal services , 21 digits in Te@@ gel did not be occupied , 19 should take away 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what to do in Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany following forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , according to vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to accommodate a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a determination in the light of the unusual challenge : &quot; I &apos;ll say again and again , we can do that and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
with different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Culture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) Apartments every year - and over the next five years .
this is almost twice as many as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space , but above all in paid rental properties : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social flats are due to rent , and around these very cheap apartments will also apply refugees .
the Minister of Defence Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double @-@ up funding from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut : 80 000 social flats every year would have to rise and therefore the federal government should have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
the group of scientists and the Federal Minister of Culture in it is , that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing .
according to the Institute of Labour Market and Professional Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the seats were in Germany in the long run .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , Project Manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is decisive whether in Germany they find work .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording company , but also for self @-@ esteem of the migrants , says migration investig@@ ator Diet@@ rich Thr@@ aci@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , it has been a political change according to Thr@@ acian : from the work ban for refugees to recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while it used to be a working ban for asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the attendance of the residents , asylum seekers on a residential location .
in society - even because of the lack of qualified labour , the view gained from being able to access jobs more quickly to the labour market .
a major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
until now there is no an adequate programme of general and job@@ less language courses .
studies show also that jobs are commonly reported by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore to view the Thr@@ ace of the Royal Road to the work@@ re@@ integration .
the Berlin @-@ government has established that only a few refugees spend their children in the Kit@@ &apos;s , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents &apos; root , Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar says , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration .
to convey the family nevertheless from the advantages of the cas@@ ita , distributed the administration of hand@@ pieces in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators hei@@ gh@@ ten the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - e.g. by allowing more professional schools .
in the countries students are prepared without a knowledge of teaching at the classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have one qualification in English as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suitcase of the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk is that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
generally no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or Ge@@ tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
study @-@ free refugees could be facilitated by access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a so@@ jour@@ n or de@@ for@@ estation not receive any benefits after the asylum seekers &apos; Act , if they begin a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter normally receive no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate people .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany so far in order to have the BA@@ Fö@@ G authorized to be eligible from 1 January 2016 , this span@@ iel is shortened to 15 months .
but this financing does not need to be closed , call Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will continue to play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the State ought to clear the same rights to Islam and succ@@ es@@ sively develop the same rights as the churches and develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religions .
it would also be important the establishment of a Muslim Wel@@ fare association which is professional taking care of new arri@@ vals .
rights are also obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the representatives of the Islam must be clear and ready to work with the state in many fields and regulate some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes willingness to face against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday &apos;s concerns , religious conflicts can also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to su@@ ck such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will in future be a topic of society today .
in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade over a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a gener@@ equality law .
but it was learn very slow how the NS@@ U series revealed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and stakeholders cannot challenge Germany for a long time , and why international agreements , such as anti @-@ racial NGOs in Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country &apos;s peace and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany is capable of providing the expected refugees with previously expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the money does not need to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all newcom@@ ers demands equally to the registration health cards .
yiel@@ ded services could be reck@@ oned later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long term , it is highly questionable as many people look down with the restricted performance catalogue that asylum seekers &apos; asylum seekers .
otherwise make physicians to create the language barriers especially .
previously , the Berlin science scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are ill more ill over her diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctors &apos; offices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over , she demands .
a lot of refugees would be helped , but also with more general medical attacks in emergency out@@ ages .
and with a different diagnostic view .
among refugee camps , there are significantly more silent , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partial other disease images , German physicians were trained from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and as regards the sle@@ ves , be perhaps even allevi@@ ating from the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors .
to be missed , however , they must prove their qualifications and take a look again at once again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is ill for at least half of the refugees in Germany ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or among depres@@ sions .
especially vulnerable to the refugee camp , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU Munich demonstrates that every fifth , Syrian refugee camp is in@@ trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is suffering from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , suffers from others to so @-@ called bot@@ t@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ pac@@ ed and death @-@ death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration @-@ dys@@ functions , strong ch@@ ant@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although , mentally , asylum seekers can face a request for a psycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months to edit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , in the social offices mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for the mental disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ pl@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
the EP was also practi@@ sed by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition , which they would have received anonymous death threats and had been warned about it , to address the language of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ams .
last month they held him bu@@ gged and interrupted by his speech at the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese told that seven op@@ positions leaders have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned that Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists according to Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members concerned that immunity are ending in the Parliament and once they leave parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief Executive Officer , who was guided by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to grow at least 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the company &apos;s restructuring and manufacturing efforts .
HP will split up into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job @-@ mining results in a strain of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , which aims to lead the unit according to the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is now focused on smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of stores which support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing energy @-@ saving , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by graduates from Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to manufacture electric plants and their Palo Alto , which is named &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has made a massive restructuring to tackle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ rage Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates before the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t be playing again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame regarding this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had caught the last season following a separate ank@@ ling injury , and then returned to its old swing during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his knees , or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of other injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
initial investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 susp@@ end in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs which have experienced most injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil @-@ circle , but arsen@@ al that an improvement in the risk of injuries is not last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation , you have a free time period , a time in which you will have to strengthen your body and gain an explosive force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will have a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself as a rotation within the Team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ieren Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of rep@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players it , a little let @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the arsen@@ al favor@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the greatest intimi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also defeated , after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ conqu@@ erable &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , being measured on the Richter scale . 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is in the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson of last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains by far @-@ reaching hope , with its management the association to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough at the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly in view of how the need for males to open themselves , now even more doub@@ ted than ever has become , how su@@ icide bom@@ bed among young men on a 15 @-@ year hei@@ r .
in 2013 it was the most important cause for men in the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ oom ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched existence ) 2015 as the Year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask for help if they need it .
friendship is the cent@@ rep@@ ie@@ ce in the fight for master@@ ing this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 High School students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had an insufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy spirits , &quot; his chances of recovery were double .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental heal@@ thful friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course we have to have some friends to make a friendship .
in the age of more social media related communication , focusing on style on substance , in@@ ad@@ ability of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ trin@@ sic values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affect our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beautiful at Friends was that these focus was placed on your head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s hu@@ gs , moments when playing the football wall in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely relate to being able to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a co @-@ worker of the hotline was stated to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hear@@ ings for people who are de@@ pressed and threatened with su@@ icide , has clearly demonstrated to me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term repe@@ aters .
it clearly shows the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status across the telephone may help people &apos;s eye in moments of despair also , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with the celebration of the day completely new backdrop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say Hi .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .

di Mary meets to help PS@@ G to Mal@@ col@@ on Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Le@@ din@@ son Cav@@ ani following his banner against Malmö .
di Maria meet at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to visit Malmö .
here are the game &apos;s report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Bei@@ son Cav@@ ani stopped course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince &apos;s Park stadium completed Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion to the way , but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally achieved their prot@@ ru@@ ding , being a head@@ board at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in the group A needed Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they not only seek the qualification for the N.@@ O.@@ -@@ Round but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they were got the points , it was no small play of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s . he was later changed in the game against his hometown team and against the club with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents &apos; problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we must finish in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it we haven &apos;t done one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was on the weekend of a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was out@@ saved by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian immig@@ rant was referred to as the man , who took over the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated , why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense before going to Johan Wil@@ and over to the long edge of the network .
if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off struck , in order to reach this level , entered the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was ranked with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ ø@@ d@@ j@@ ic in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself to , with some mis@@ pins and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was at no less than five attempts in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used him after the restart .
nevertheless , he pointed much more skill than he brought his te@@ amm@@ ates into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria was turning into a turn@@ around , who was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole .
the second gate finally fell shortly after the Hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er used his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ ke of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game and just have an excellent entry of po@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before spare @-@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected by the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year .
since then we only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
Matt Dam@@ on made the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown on the variety and said , she didn &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative prospects , with respect to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about variety , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the product @-@ mate Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to call people to think about this - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person and she is a N@@ ut@@ te who is beaten up by her white sne@@ ak@@ y .
the producer of De@@ ar White people set itself up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film . Dam@@ on res@@ isted that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something which we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval by men &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , using &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - this is SO W@@ H@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 sor@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on Com@@ ments occur at a time when exact representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the teenagers Michael Brown has been killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of Black lives in the country achieved a wide effect and pressing regul@@ ators and regul@@ ators against far@@ my@@ ard practices .
in February the singer Prince opened a demonstration on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) .
as books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement of Black @-@ Mat@@ ter has published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders .

professional clim@@ bers and operator assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed just her 7th season , had never seen a competition participant , who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finals .
in the last task the climbing was part of a 75 foot long Kletter@@ pping rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten had completed the task within the time , with which he completed the first athlete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! News after the harsh win victory , still under shock on winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or has had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly ... as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed dealt with The Hollywood repor@@ ters to discuss the final , and why B@@ ritten , although he ended first at all , does not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest @-@ fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he is doing a gro@@ ove on it .
he is so happy to have done what he has done .
masses of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten to someone , then I am glad there is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had the roles left .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a stag@@ gering season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers grinding to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League of Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday , the part played perfect from the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins con@@ v@@ aded a chance for Ascension in a range of Houston , for the second American League game @-@ Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to grasp over a great part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad S@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive assistance to erect three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to put an end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ seye each game and so I want to go very concentrated in the game .
the designed tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Martin@@ ez had three matches and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first tri@@ man hit game of Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he put the drums well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( intensity ) , looked much better in the bull@@ dog , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three runs in h@@ ind at the end of the seventh inside , T@@ wins had the best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ ner Brian Do@@ cian for Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy su@@ cked down wall , the only man with which he was confronted , before the nomin@@ ee R@@ ookie Miguel S@@ ano , who gave the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a two @-@ run partition .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run of the second brought Ver@@ ges the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ches to a double Play .
in the major League , it was the first time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ghs was a double Play .
after Detroit adds a Nord @-@ Run at the end of the ninth place , the wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed is S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by an even non @-@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rounds within the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veteran , which had been canc@@ eled before the game by the injury of the injury , having been missing for more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfortable when I stopped and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first gave a song to second Bas@@ ner Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez in play , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ ner Nick Castell@@ ano joined a single on the right , managed to run a further run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was released from the game when he tried to go to third , as he finished the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ ach .
he is not very well beaten , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ coun@@ tdown , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver legal @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ser .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three of us at six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez exp@@ ired because of a violation of the worm @-@ school@@ er .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the risk of injuries is to be activated for the launch on Wednesday .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of Munich &apos;s Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the aw@@ ful thinking about military activity options cannot take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he cast the European States &quot; collective away . &quot;
four years ago , it was happy that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive wave of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has also introduced border controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained the Tuesday evening of the Austrian broadcast@@ er in OR@@ F , after Hungary no one will now be returned .
also Germany did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of an agreement , after which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , provided that it had already been talks between the Direc@@ torate @-@ General for Public security and representatives from Germany .
concrete numbers called them not and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ can@@ gas from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austria colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the European States have so far not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new attempt on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on forthcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in the face of the severe refugee population in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in first @-@ up and distribution of people .
in collaboration with the countries , the federal government announced that after nearly four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister officials in Berlin on the late Tuesday evening .
Merkel underlined , those people who need protection , be@@ a@@ men this too .
who , however , have no lead @-@ perspective , can not stay in Germany either .
this view was adjustable in the round op@@ pressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now take a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck on the can@@ is@@ route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also the border with Romania would defeat a fence .
this neighborhood is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary plans to avoid the tu@@ gs of di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m in Romania , Hungary , Hungary , Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government sentenced the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had bl@@ ended the fence .
in Turkey , however , thousands of other migrants were reported on the way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; takes ocean on satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of the Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us swe@@ pt a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the space &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the Moon easily m@@ elt around its train around the ring road .
although this movement is only small , but still too big for a non @-@ permanent ascension circle , it is in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers make their analyses at the Fach@@ blatt of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
already for longer it was known that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ us liquid water must give water .
so &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es on the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds , the water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles sp@@ ies and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the south @-@ pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
the expansion of the hidden amount of oceans , however , was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to take four weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compul@@ sive break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is especially true for us , Rama is a loss of loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we must think now , &quot; said Sport@@ dire@@ ktor Nec@@ at Ay@@ ar@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible obligation of a unified professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no di@@ eting fruit - man@@ goes contain much sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often more likely to come down by them .
they contain relatively much sugar - above all Sac@@ char@@ ose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are nevertheless : in them there are B vitamins , as well as vitamins C and C. At all , they contain hob@@ bies but a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports visual , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing it , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too tight and acceptable .
the form@@ work color alone does not say anything about it , as ripe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ goes very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed in a few days .
then they obviously taste pure or sweet food .
however , a man@@ go there are also sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it mel@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of ap@@ leaf sal@@ ads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lamb and Wild .
the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS presents for the Christmas business of the United States up to 1,@@ 9@@ 5000 subsidies .

first F@@ ash@@ ore , then marked trail
the next night passes through the valleys of the Alpine race through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland was on Tuesday through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fes@@ tivity sometimes sw@@ ells with storm @-@ strength through the promis@@ ers .
after F@@ ishing on Thursday morning , us crosses a marked line , that puts strong rainf@@ alls , wind@@ ow@@ ls and a temperature reverse .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a Communication writes , Switzerland currently lies on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British islands in a sharp southwest .
on the Alp@@ enn@@ ese side , the night will break through the valleys through the valleys .
as a result of this morning , it blow up until Thursday morning in the fishing valleys with goats of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and particularly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , some also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can pre@@ tend to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and and in the mountains even Or@@ kan@@ ers are available from more than 120 km / h .
as in the north the Wednesday m@@ eh@@ n for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the humidity starts to hang out at the al@@ k slope .
here , rain put up , which lasts until Thursday night .
the sum of the Alps must be calculated over the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , this after the last days we have already fallen large rainf@@ all .
on Thursday morning the f@@ ohn of the air goes out , in the episode be@@ vel@@ ed a cold @-@ front with heavy , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east through Switzerland .
together with the K@@ alt@@ ru@@ è@@ cle , the wind strongly sa@@ iled up to stor@@ my and temperatures go back clearly .
the following days are in the north her@@ al@@ ous with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the contrary , it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther &apos;s place .
in the presence of Saint Ign@@ a@@ zio San Marino on Wednesday a previously un@@ named place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill christ@@ ened the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome right next to the Col@@ ise@@ um .
the naming was requested by the work of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live for centuries as a minority only in hiding their faith .
with the place in a symbolic fashion the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was attended as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a sin@@ ister pack .
his negative impressions hoped to affir@@ med him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then introduced with his theses against the S@@ las@@ h@@ an@@ del in the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental Church .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces , which has painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated the Bible .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has been released with gorgeous pictures now .
in the beginning , the image was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt , who had formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , adjusted to the respective subjects , this can quite be quite ble@@ ak .
about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many fields of &quot; book all books &quot; .
ar@@ eg@@ ated cycles that dedicate themselves like cross@@ wise , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
at the moment , he was fascinated immediately several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler @-@ publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and since it is above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post which looked up on the basis of the painting with the scriptures .
he has interpreted the Bible study of Ot@@ mar Alt -@@ Bible and so today , into current relations . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original &apos; Bible &apos; of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who is here formulated his completely personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry @-@ recording has Golden Let@@ ters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old now allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions was ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode , and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant evangel@@ ion order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education already occurred with the Rohr@@ stock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to work again and perhaps again to the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art of art in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of images is now characterized by the advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures always have a bit of secrecy and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , discover it and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image looks for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post star@@ and on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; I like what he understands with his images . &quot;
old do not have much to grasp the Bible but also selected for it important , also mysterious issues .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; Al@@ te@@ post says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; written was a pictures @-@ Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from the Luther &apos;s house , this work is an invitation to strengthen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Stiftung .
construction work for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , corporations instruc@@ t the ground@@ ing for a round@@ trip : one year later it was almost everything ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finally finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration sp@@ ans , especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus hills de@@ ported , new place sought - well equipped with formal planning and application for building permits .
the approval will go in October , the first church council Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck will now be communicated to the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working on the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , who plays a clear sign in the Bundesliga on weekends .
the football re@@ acts to the mounting situation in Germany and secur@@ es its aid in addressing the problems encountered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since our reunion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can be no one saying , &quot; there is nothing at all to do , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting to every individual to get a handle on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugees of refugees in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the Minister of State in Ms Ost@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive rays must be posed the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football alliance has therefore broad@@ ened its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some German lig@@ ists support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a marks a clear sign when it is going to pay on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor @-@ school ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make this clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sports chief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every day , nobody must disc@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can , no , we need to use our radi@@ otherapy , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
to the EM @-@ qualifying game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German soccer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ences had to start their own projects have been magnificent .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , will be in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of huge importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year the association will be provided jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the German government 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole year for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Pre@@ man@@ power loses an eye of the accident
Chief Executive Vice President of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ th@@ mot@@ t , repor@@ tedly , has lost its left eye on several reports , due to the fall in the beginning of July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a glass of water after midnight , which he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he was almost blood@@ thir@@ dly , then dropped out and stuck to the street - which he tells us last week , &quot; c@@ ites the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where &quot; SAP @-@ founder H@@ asso Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the supervisory council meeting in Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting with &quot; fully fit for work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP there , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ otes the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ otes comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen to such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Po@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury , while he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes with the offspring in Singapore on the weekend just as little as a reservoir for the two Pedi@@ atri@@ ots Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button delivered , like one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will finally be sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europe League .
the national player will also be missing the leader of the soccer team in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ coach will be open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem position on the re@@ us position .
thus , he announced a change on the door@@ keeper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the place from the keeper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether the Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe @-@ league games , but the an@@ kles got open .
with high probability he will also ride the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mit@@ player Re@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statement that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the objective that mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ un@@ tos : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
Germany should be at the forefront of the German Government &apos;s will at the end of the German government .
the Cab@@ inet was adopted on Wednesday a strategy paper from the home of traffic , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the very edge of the Autom@@ atic IA@@ A at the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and networked drive will increase traffic safety and provide for less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with the industry representatives from the IA@@ A .
among other things , the Ministry of Applied Sciences is emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a high @-@ level rise in digital radio .
a testing facility is currently based on the 9 in Bavaria for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework , and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Germany wants to use about international that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is up@@ lifted from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government also wants to don@@ ate itself to a change in the Vienna Convention which so far only sees the people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mostly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
after a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible .
however , the road @-@ less cars on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected only as far back as 2020 . &quot;
the value @-@ added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Federal Republic of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic ti@@ cian S@@ cent Bar@@ ra@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the issue of liability in the case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers has to be clear clear .
yet the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are even more skep@@ tical - a lot more than French or American .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA @-@ Institute on behalf of the test @-@ based DE@@ K@@ RA will result in the outcome that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will succeed in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of the surve@@ yed expected to be 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in case the drivers in Germany are not ready to completely leave a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of digital services , only seven percent would agree to take control during the entire ride on all roads .
on the free@@ way , the traffic could be at least 15 percent in traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
well every fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances .
Ver@@ oll says team@@ - and Double @-@ starts with the ping p@@ ong table
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will fight after current status with the title of September 25 to October 4 only in sol@@ vent .
the final decision will be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; it is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are strong enough to take the title also without Timo the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oll was agreed at this time on the flight to a sponsorship project in China .
the 34 year old German champion is returned on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage , we are no longer as a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favorite &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared single European commission Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ als in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but was again reminded of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was also missing , and we have become Europe championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the World Ran@@ kings @-@ Fifth .

Gau@@ l@@ tier is too old for an En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a combination of a very large fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works @-@ gr@@ ot@@ tos : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequ@@ ins that look terri@@ fying naked thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which , among others , has been stimulated by Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in a tube .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be so easy , in the meantime it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle in the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ cker has changed his beginning to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition was a bit about death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is related to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into it &apos;s barely noticeable work of the man , who has written the fashion story without ever taking a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographer , for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material made the creators according to the curator of Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
just before the start of the October revolution , there was still a special delic@@ acy : one le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ out@@ fit with Kor@@ se@@ tt .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Te@@ ddy is seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ony man@@ ners of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he was attracted to his te@@ ddy Be@@ HS and clothes , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; releasing the fashion I have later joined themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he st@@ ole fashion copies and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier was told in Munich .
later I bought the but of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models .
they were not got , but we were allowed to keep the gear .
jewelry instead of sh@@ utter - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ n@@ ish
previously it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y in and around Pl@@ cks , meter to do .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and l@@ aces were produced in large quantity for clients that they further developed to create blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the designer &apos;s store .
instead , the fashion is again important .
in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ener top , fashion has played a larger role , then it was pushed through the home textile industry and is now discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
generally lik@@ ens the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Mode , which leans out in past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ che , a growing order potential .
whoever does not serve the niche in Germany in the Czech industry is no longer on the market .
with us they have already made half of all orders .
split &apos;s profile with nine other companies joined in the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
roughly 80 percent of the sales were destroyed in the last 15 years .
private dealers and wholesale stores are almost no longer available .
our products reach the customer on this path hardly any more .
the mass of mass in the Asian region is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are driven almost exclusively on chains .
weak@@ ly from export , up to Russia and to the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries to score points through environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer is explained by the nitrogen farm in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year we have been following a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt comple@@ ments : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma artist U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow@@ shoe Coast of the West@@ deutsche ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - und specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and l@@ aces .
in order to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a clash between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that must be thought most economically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design can often be used easily in order to hold a customer base .
a few years ago the textile design @-@ designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was re@@ vis@@ ing the historical snow@@ shoe @-@ top .
the machine embro@@ i@@ dered in some places small kitchen .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ ber@@ smith in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ d inspired it : &quot; before I could not start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ shoe @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure she shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies them to the United States , Australia and Finland - mainly to clients whose ancestors have lived in ch@@ ew and surroundings and want to mem@@ ori@@ ze the mem@@ or@@ ab@@ ilia .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ®

this is about the experiences of the N@@ anny and the family B@@ anks in times of the financial crisis in England .

XI urges the economy to open the economy more broadly for the world
the economy has to open wide open to the outside , to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping in the Tuesday of a group , commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should work for it to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a consultation at the 16th session of the Central executive group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encourage new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ i said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity for regulating the access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promoting state controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents of building system .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity is created , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance because it affor@@ ds the market a greater role in the healing of resources , ensured a legally binding business environment and organised the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also en@@ forcing control over the powers transferred to businesses and make sure companies decide how to conduct its business .
the Statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors to open , further areas are opened to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will provide the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded company and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by making the requirements optimized and the application process is facilitated .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , exercise , and professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li St@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as in a statement published after the meeting was issued .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury in prey
the European Commission plans to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in big rob@@ bery and the consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve wre@@ cks .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is appropriate in the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects inf@@ alli@@ zed industrial and environmental policy are handled with full weight of pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt by F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt is to put the threshold of the nerve pressure for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one on two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram of fish .
but big rob@@ bery @-@ fish are so strongly poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the current threshold values , approximately 50 per cent of the cor@@ ds were not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the threshold values then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be imp@@ aired .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to watch the threshold values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ win@@ watch used this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller patches of cem@@ eter@@ ies , such as car@@ p are usually so low to keep the planned maximum ones already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the distr@@ action at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de of distr@@ action that only helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a non @-@ poison@@ ous heavy metal , which is strongly endangered over the food chain , especially in prey .
the German government is thus warning that &quot; small quantities are already &quot; cause especially in the case of un@@ born lesi@@ ons of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment claims on his home page with regard to the current relevance , but that an &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; could not be expected .
Mercury is mainly due to coal @-@ combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Commerce , the German Federal Ministry of Appe@@ al As@@ wan Ba@@ er@@ bock come across more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity listed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March of the paper quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year pan @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cury in fish are already counted among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
