The organization is aimed at a special account under the designation "special account statements," which will contribute to the Member States in accordance with this agreement as the Administrator "manager." this account will be referred to as the "Administrator" organisation, and only in this agreement defined by the agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.
The special account will be separately separate and separated from any other accounts and activa.
The contributions are as follows: a) Payment will be paid in the form of cash or uninsatiable debt and a member of the member state that are due to demand in the currency of the organization as the administrator of the special account and in the organisation of the organisation in the relevant country.
B) The payment is carried out in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. contributions within 30 days of the agreement of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator are agreed;
II) the second in height of the rest of the accession to the 1. January 1979 or at another date, which has been agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval.
C) Every member state can afford payments from the above mentioned dates.
The caretaker will be in accordance with the usual processes of the organization about proportional screenings to cash or schoolchildren, in order to cover the expenses for the special payment loan and the special account in appropriately.
With respect to this loan, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the regulations of the following factors:
III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems in the country;
VI) the composition and the trend of the country's debt service and further loan of lending capacity to loan loss; and
VII) To the extent that the problems of the related countries will be governed by contributions from other sources.
Each special loan loan serves as financing of a clearly identifiable and rapid offset program (including a sectoral development program), regardless of whether it is approved for the loan of the organization, or not, according to the procedure and practices, which is approved and administered by the preamble funds in this agreement the objective of the Additional charges.
The funds of the special account may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (bank) or the organization that has already been approved in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project, which has already been approved by directors of the Bank or the organization.
In addition to section 4, special payment transactions are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally exempt for the organisation granted by the Organisation; they are therefore reimmeasurable at ten years of age in 50 years.
Special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and reimmeasurable in these currencies.
Amounts to pay this prayer clock are directly connected to the organisation they retains.
Each special loan which is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator, in particular the origin of the means is indicated.
The income from any special payment loans can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient, or goods or services that are made in a member state; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization and that of what the stewards could be given at the time of the loan, recipients of a special agent.
Capital inflow of special payment loans are made to the special account account, and the amount paid to this way in the currency of a member state is returned to its entrance as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant Member State.
The caretaker is instructed until complete charges of all special agreements with the EEC concerning the investigators approved in preparation and approved by the directors of approved projects and programs.
During the period of the payment loan, the caretaker teaches the EEC into quarterly on the development of special pricing and charges for this.
The caretaker dictates the EEC as soon as possible according to the conclusion of the organization's complete billing account with an opinion from external auditors in the organization to this account.
Following a full payment of the special loans, the EEC and the EEC will soon transmit an executable report on the projects funded by the Special Operations account.
The caretaker builds and execute suitable records, calculations, from which the contributions to the current account, dating from the contomies to finance commitments and accounts receipts from account and returned to the Member States.
The EEC and the caretakers are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.
To do this, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the stewards until complete issue of the special account accounts for time have financed a thought of thinking about the status of the special account, the continuation of the Special Operations Convention, the continuation of this agreement, which relate to the provisions of this agreement.
Is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, the EEC and the Organisation (if necessary) agree not into force, so the agreement and all of them are due to the commitments of the parties with immediate effect.
"" "" "" "the total capital amount of all receivers is paid by the receivers in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and resigned to the Member States, this agreement and all of them are concluded with immediate effect." ""
This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the provisions of each party.
Governments of the Member States notifies the decision of the Council of the European Communities to conclude that they are concerned.

A reagent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the antigen that is homolog the antibodies or another on the label's substance homolog.
If a reagent is used by the manufacturer, the following factors or apparitions may not appear: a) emolytic properties;
As a result, the Titer is measured in a suitable medium through the reluent of the reagenzes to the double in a suitable medium.
The Titer is the reziest value of the number of the strongest serum, in which a reaction is occurs; the dilution will only be calculated from the volume of blood cells in the total volume.
In anti-A, anti-B or other reagents that are to be used on object dreams, activity is expressed by time, which is necessary for a agglutination on an object carrier.
The World Health Organisation has established anti-A and anti-B as well as incomplete anti-D reagents for blood group determination to the International Standards, and for reagents of other specificity will be processed in the current standards.
According to definition, an international standard preparative contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml, and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations (1).
(1) The effectiveness of reagents for blood group determination of most specifalities is expressed as agglutinationalised, which is observed in a series of dilution with an erythrocyte flooding.
The Titer gives the dilution of the reagent in the last mixture inside a series where a microscopic is visible agglutination.
The effectiveness of reagents for blood group determination, for the International standard preparations are present (currently anti-A and anti-B as well as incomplete anti-D), can be expressed on the basis of the international standard preparatory or state of state standards (See Bulletin WHO, 1954, 10, 937, 941 - 1950, 3, 301).
If you return it to a volume of 1 ml, the anti-A and anti-B, according to definition 256 international units per ml.
The preparations are available for free from the International laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organization, Statutes Serum Institute, Copenhagen.
The following table shows an example of a comparative title of international standard Anti-A (S) and an "unknown" anti-A Reagenzes (U) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A2B. > PIC FILE = "T0045083" >
If a reagent is stored under the manufacturer recommended, its required properties should remain at least one year long.
The expiration date of a reagent in flux form according to the label is not one year after the last satisfactory effect.
The expiration date on the label, on the label, depends on the results of the durability tests. it is approving by the government officials.
Dried reagences are kept in an atmosphere of inerant gas or in a vacuum, while in the glass container, in which it has been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter.
A dry reacting may not lose at most 0,5 BC to its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor pentoxide when it is tested within 24 hours.
To prevent bacterial growth, the responsible state authority can determine that the reagent (or the solvent) is an antiseptic and / or antibiotic, if the reagent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements of specifity and effectiveness.
Sera human origin on blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml of flux or re-dissolved serums.
Reagents, indifferent, whether in flux form or after recovery, must be transparent and may not contain sediments nor gels or visible particles.
According to the international exchange, certain reagents for blood group determination should not be colored as possible, at least as long as the International Convention has come about a unified system.
Reagents for blood group determination are in such a way and spread in such quantities that this is not only enough to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells.
The quantity must be so large in a tank, that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy of efficacy described in this protocol.
The manufacturer-laboratory has over all output levels and checks of the reagents for blood group-related records.
Adequate samples of all issued reagents are so long to store for the laboratory with some likelihood that the batch is no longer used.
The reagents of the reagents of reagents can contain substances human, animal, vegetable (or mineral) origin; some of these represent the effective share, the others are the necessary aid to amplify the effectiveness and conservation of the stability of the reagent.
For technical reasons, these reagents are classified according to the origin of their real estate in three groups.
This does not mean that the reagents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal reagents contain no substances of human origin.
On each individual container is a black-and-white label in English and French language which contains the following information: 1. name and address of the manufacturer,
4. the amount or, for dried reagents, the quantity and composition of the liquid-solution needed liquid,
In addition, this label or the label on the box, in which the individual containers are located, or which included the containers to contain the following details: 1. full name and address of the manufacturer,

Each program is to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the attachment to this protocol.
Anti-A serum is extracted from the blood of the group B, which can be characterized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A.
Anti-A serum served human red blood cells that include A-antigen, i.e. those of group A and AB including subgroup A1, A2, A1B and A2B. there are no human blood cells that contain no A-antigen, i.e. those of the blood group 0 and B.
An anti-A serum is parallel to the again dissolved, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-A blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison parat separated from A1-, A2- and A2B-blood cells.
In no case, the effectiveness of the server can be in no case less than 64 international units per ml.
If anti-A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of A1-, A2- and A2B-blood cells, which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with again, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-A blood group servers or a standard preparatory of equal Avidity.
Anti-B Serum is extracted from the blood of the group A, which can be immunised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B.
Anti-B Serum acts as human red blood cells that contain B-antigen, i.e. those of blood-groups B and AB; there are no human body blood cells that contain no B-antigen, i.e. those of blood-groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum is parallel to the again dissolved, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-B blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison of B-blood cells.
If anti-B Serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of B-blood cells, so the agglutination must occur within the double period, which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with again, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-B blood group servers, or with a standard shape of equal Avidity.
Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons in group 0, which can be immunised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B.
Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) serum levels human red blood cells, which includes Agglutinugenic A and / or B, i.e. those of group A, including sub-groups A1 and A2; there are no human blood cells that contain no agglutinous A or B, i.e. those of group 0.
It agglutinates human red blood cells that contain the Ax (Ay or Ao) antigen (which are not agglutinated in the general by anti-A serum of blood donors of group B).
An anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is parallel to the again dissolved, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-A blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison parat, separated against flooding of A1 and A2 blood cells.
At the same time, it is parallel to the again dissolved, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-B blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison of B-blood cells.
In no case, the effectiveness of the server can be in no case less than 64 international units per ml.
Anti-A + Anti-B (group 0) blood serum must also cause a easily recognizable agglutination of the group Ax (Ay or Ao).
If an anti-A + anti-B (group 0) has been mixed with equal amounts of 5- to 10percent spread of A1 and A2 blood cells, so the agglutination should appear within the double time, which is necessary if the same experiments with which again dissolved, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-A blood group servers, or with a standard preparative balance of the same activity.
If anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of B blood cells, which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with again, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-B blood group servers or a standard preparatory of equal Avidity.
If an anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of blood cells, so agglutination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C.
Anti-Rh blood group sera each specificity can be one of two types, which differ by the preconditions in which a agglutination of homologous blood cells is achieved.
With others known as "incomplete," a agglutination can only be reached during presence of specific colloids, such as cattle albumin or with other special methods.
"" "some" "" "incomplete" "" "Sera agglutiners on object-dreadings are also homologous red blood cells in their own serum or plasma." ""
The following requirements for the effectiveness of Sera regarding the determination of the Rh Group may possibly change when International standard preparations are available. i) Anti-D (Anti-Rho) blood-group vaccine (human)
Anti-D serum is extracted from the blood one or more people who are immunised through the antigen D of the Rh system.
It reacts with human red blood cells that contain the antigen D, but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the antigen D.
"complete" anti-D Sera must have a titre of at least 1: 32 compared to CcDee blood cells in a 0.9percent cooking solution.
A "incomplete" anti-D serum is parallel to the again dissolved, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the incomplete Anti-D (Anti-Rho) serum or a corresponding comparison-parat versus CcDee blood cells.
In addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the tigen D, the serum should react with blood cells, the Do-Antigen.
Anti-D Sera, which are intended to use objectors in accordance with the test to Diamond and Abelson, have to have mixed agglutination in 30 seconds within 30 seconds, and the agglutination must be complete within 120 seconds.
Anti-C serum is extracted from the blood one or more, which are immunised by the agglutinogen C of the Rh system.
It reacts with flooding of human blood cells that contain the antigen C, but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C-antigen.
These Sera are therefore specific to the C-tigen, only if the tested blood cells are inhibited in a 0.9percent cooking solution.
The title of the anti-C Sera ("complete" or "incomplete") must be at least 1: 8 compared to Ccddee blood cells.
Anti-C Sera, which are intended to use objectors in accordance with the test to Diamond and Abelson (and no form of anti-D) must be mixed if they have a visible agglutination in 30 seconds, and the agglutination must be complete within 120 seconds.
Anti-E serum is extracted from the blood one or more people who are immunised through the antigen e-system.
Anti-E Sera ("complete" or "incomplete") should have a Titer of at least 1: 8 compared to CcddEe blood cells.
Anti-E Sera, which are intended to use objectors in accordance with the test to Diamond and Abelson (and in no form anti-D), if they have mixed up on an object carrier with a same amount of 40- to 50percent spread of ccddlee blood cells within 30 seconds, and the agglutination must be completed within 120 seconds.
Sera of specifity anti-D + -C and the specificity anti-D + -E can immediately be obtained from the blood of immunised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum.
In a given serum, both antibodies must be effective at the same time.
If a serum is intended to use objections according to the test according to Diamond and Abelson, the agglutinous period in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction is not less than the antine antibodies.
Anti-A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immune due to blood cells or specific substances of group A.
Anti-A serum served human red blood cells that contain A-antigen that means those of blood-groups A and AB including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B; there are no human blood cells that contain no A-antigen, which means those of blood-groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum is parallel to the repeated, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-A blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison parat, separated with flooding of A1, A2 and A2B red blood cells (1).
If anti-A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of A1-, A2- and A2B-blood cells, which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the repeated, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-A blood group servers or a standard preparatory of equal Avidity.
Anti-B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be detected by red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B.
Anti-B Serum acts as human red blood cells that contain B-antigen, which means those of blood-groups B and AB; there are no human body blood cells that contain no B-antigen, which means those of blood-groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum, parallel to the repeated, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-B blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison of blood cells from the B group B to titrieren (1).
If anti-B Serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of B-blood cells, so the agglutination must occur within the double time, which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the repeated, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-B blood group servers, or with a standard preparatory of equal Avidity.
Anti-human globulin serum for use in blood-group serology must contain agglutinizing antibodies against IgG globulin and agglutinous antibodies against complementary factors.
It is gained from the blood of animals, which are immune by injection of human serum proteins.
It is used according to the manufacturer, so agglutinously does not include unloaded human red blood cells, indifferent from which blood group belong to them.
(2) Coombs, R.R.A.; Mourant, A.E. and Race, R.R.A.; Mourant, A.E. and Race, R.R. (1945); Brit.
Anti-Lea antibodies are sensitized, and red blood cells that are sensitive to the above-called "incomplete cold blood cells that are sensitive to human IgG globulin, and eventually with 10 different samples of unloaded human blood cells with and without A- and B antigens.
An anti-human globulin serum must cause a strong agglutination of red blood cells, which are loaded with the human incomplete anti-D Sera using a titre of 1: 4 (or less) if the title of D-positive blood cells is carried out after the "Albumin method" method.
In the same dilution, the anti-K anti-positive human blood cells and the anti-Fya anti-positive red blood cells is sensitively perceived to the weak anti-K anti-positive red blood cells.
In the same or another on the label, there must also be human red blood cells, which are sensitive to the presence of fresh human serum with weak complementing incomplete anti-Lea antibodies.
For clinical use, the charge with all types of the incomplete antibody should be detectable with a single dilution of the anti-human globulin serum.
Anti-A reagent is gained by extracting from the seeds or other parts of an appropriate plant and appropriate cleaning.
The anti-A reagent agglutinates human red blood cells that contain A-antigens which means those of blood-groups A and AB including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B; there are no human blood cells that do not contain a A-antigen, which means those of blood-groups 0 and B.
An anti-A reagent is parallel to the rejuvenate, but undiluted International standard preparatory of the anti-A blood group servers, or a corresponding comparison parat, separated against flooding of A1-, A2- and A2B-blood cells (1).
In no case, the effectiveness of the reagent may amount to less than 64 international units per ml.
If anti-A reagent is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of A1-, A2- and A2B-blood cells, which is necessary if the same attempt has been dissolved with again, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-A blood group servers, or with a standard shape of equal treatment (iii) anti-B blood group reacting (vegetal)
Anti-B reagent is gained by extracting from the appropriate part of an appropriate plant and appropriate cleaning.
The anti-B reagent agglutinates human red blood cells that contain the agglutinogenic B, which means those of blood cells B and AB; there are no human blood cells that contains no agglutinogenic B, which means those of blood-groups 0 and A.
If anti-B reagent is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5- to 10percent spread of B-blood cells, so the agglutination must occur within the double time, which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the repeated, but undiluted International standard preparative of the anti-B blood group servers or a standard preparatory of equal Avidity.
(1) The International standard preparatory is human origin; it may be appropriate for appropriate comparing comparison, human or non-human origin.
