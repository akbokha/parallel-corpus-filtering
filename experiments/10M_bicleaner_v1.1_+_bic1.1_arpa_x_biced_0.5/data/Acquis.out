purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure as required by the provisions of the Part I via securing measures .
the aim of the process of securing measures in this Convention is the tim@@ ely discovery of degra@@ dation of significant quantity of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear @-@ canc@@ ers for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such ab@@ duction by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a securing force in Article 28 , the material bookings will be used as a securing force , associated with the spatial input and observation as an important supple@@ mental measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technical specification of the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , which is not shown for a period of time , resulting in the measurement limits for the specified measurement .
when performing their ref@@ uses , the organization makes an article 3 full use of ensuring the implementation of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in use of their securing measures , the community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind , as far as required , as they are determined in comple@@ mentary ad@@ ditions and are practical services :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of inher@@ ent , produced , lost , lost or any other way from the continu@@ ance of the core material and the inventory of the stock ;
B ) the rating of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and accuracy of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining and assessment of differences in measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) procedures for evaluation of anom@@ ali@@ es not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system that existed for any material balance zone to the core material and the changes of this taxation , including one - and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) Pre@@ ferences that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are implemented correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ edings of re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
securing measures after this conven@@ tions did not extend to materials in mining or in the mines .
B ) U@@ ran - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material that has not yet reached under letter c ) described in the states , thus divided the community of the organization &apos;s quantity and composition of the material with if it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving nuclear materials , which is suitable according to composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , which is manufactured , or will this core material or another , introduced in a later phase of the core burning cycle of the core material into the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures .
a ) The provisions of securing measures are not fulfilled in this Convention on Nuclear Safety , but the Community is the opinion that the recovery of nuclear materials , the securing measures are not possible , or if desired , consult the organisation and community members about the use of suitable safety measures .
B ) The measures implemented in this Convention are concluded for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community is sensual , that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ undable .
on request of the community , the organisation delivered the following core material from securing measures after this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when it is used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if the core material is rec@@ u@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organization of nuclear materials that otherwise securing measures would be subject to this Convention , provided by this safety measures , provided that no more than any time this article in the States delivered nuclear material amount more than
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) U@@ ran with a enrich@@ ment that is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran can be calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the five @-@ mentioned square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of rounded ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should be a core material , together with core material that is subject to the securing measures after this Convention , processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re@@ application of securing measures are taken on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supple@@ mentary ass@@ essments , which is necessary in the scope of the successful and effective exploitation of the organisation after the Convention on the Convention , to determine the procedure specified in the procedure .
the comple@@ mentary bind@@ ings can be extended or changed without a change in agreement between the organization and community .
the comple@@ mentary ad@@ ditions are combined with or as soon as possible after the force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the states do all efforts to enter into force within the nin@@ ety days after the force of this Convention ; an extension of this deadline needs to enter into force between the organization , the community and the States .
the organization on the basis of the initial initial survey of the entire , securing measures of this Convention on the core material in the States , regardless of its origin , reli@@ es on and leads this review directory due to the successive reports and results of their re@@ frac@@ tures .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation )
in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the conference on international economic cooperation with low @-@ income countries whose development is imp@@ aired by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire member of the Member States contributed to bank@@ rupt@@ cies of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC has presented the EEC into a table , in which way they intended to turn the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization is aimed at a special account under the designation &quot; special account statements , &quot; which will contribute to the Member States in accordance with this agreement as the Administrator &quot; manager . &quot; this account will be referred to as the &quot; Administrator &quot; organisation , and only in this agreement defined by the agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special account will be separately separate and separated from any other accounts and activ@@ a .
the contributions are as follows : a ) Payment will be paid in the form of cash or un@@ ins@@ ati@@ able debt and a member of the member state that are due to demand in the currency of the organization as the administrator of the special account and in the organisation of the organisation in the relevant country .
B ) The payment is carried out in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . contributions within 30 days of the agreement of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator are agreed ;
II ) the second in height of the rest of the accession to the 1 . January 1979 or at another date , which has been agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval .
C ) Every member state can afford payments from the above mentioned dates .
the car@@ et@@ aker will be in accordance with the usual processes of the organization about proportional scre@@ enings to cash or school@@ children , in order to cover the expenses for the special payment loan and the special account in appropri@@ ately .
with respect to this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the regulations of the following factors :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems in the country ;
VI ) the composition and the trend of the country &apos;s debt service and further loan of lending capacity to loan loss ; and
VII ) To the extent that the problems of the related countries will be gover@@ ned by contributions from other sources .
each special loan loan serves as financing of a clearly identi@@ fiable and rapid offset program ( including a sec@@ toral development program ) , regardless of whether it is approved for the loan of the organization , or not , according to the procedure and practices , which is approved and administered by the pre@@ am@@ ble funds in this agreement the objective of the Additional charges .
the funds of the special account may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( bank ) or the organization that has already been approved in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by directors of the Bank or the organization .
in addition to section 4 , special payment transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally exemp@@ t for the organisation granted by the Organisation ; they are therefore re@@ im@@ measur@@ able at ten years of age in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and re@@ im@@ measur@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this prayer clock are directly connected to the organisation they re@@ tains .
each special loan which is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means is indicated .
the income from any special payment loans can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient , or goods or services that are made in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and that of what the ste@@ wards could be given at the time of the loan , recipi@@ ents of a special agent .
capital inf@@ low of special payment loans are made to the special account account , and the amount paid to this way in the currency of a member state is returned to its entrance as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant Member State .
the car@@ et@@ aker is instructed until complete charges of all special agreements with the EEC concerning the investig@@ ators approved in preparation and approved by the directors of approved projects and programs .
during the period of the payment loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC into quarterly on the development of special pricing and charges for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker dict@@ ates the EEC as soon as possible according to the conclusion of the organization &apos;s complete billing account with an opinion from external audi@@ tors in the organization to this account .
following a full payment of the special loans , the EEC and the EEC will soon transmit an exec@@ utable report on the projects funded by the Special Operations account .
the car@@ et@@ aker builds and execute suitable records , calculations , from which the contributions to the current account , dating from the con@@ tom@@ ies to finance comm@@ itments and accounts recei@@ pts from account and returned to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ wards until complete issue of the special account accounts for time have financed a thought of thinking about the status of the special account , the continuation of the Special Operations Convention , the continuation of this agreement , which relate to the provisions of this agreement .
is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation ( if necessary ) agree not into force , so the agreement and all of them are due to the comm@@ itments of the parties with immediate effect .

I ad@@ ore you to confirm the receipt of your present writing with the word wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful for you to confirm the approval of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of change between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements - the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States in the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BIS could close stand@@ by @-@ loan agreements with central banks of the credi@@ tors , if banks have a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism required by the credi@@ tor and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion of billing ; this equals 50 % of the future deploy@@ ments of the member countries .
even now , some conditions are called , to whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
at each stand@@ by credit , the BIS first would take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als stocks , without which a total of five years are exceeded .
at the opening of loans , as well as the pro@@ longed extension , the BIS would calculate a credit rating vision .
furthermore , the first draw should not be made before the end of a month after the conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can take the required adjust@@ ments of their own liqui@@ dity .
the draw would be made in the BIS at the end of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time periods , which would be taken into consideration the funds in the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which have applied the BIS at the time of similar conditions on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond to the market rates .
if the BIS must have pro@@ vision@@ ed the necessary funds itself on the market , then the application could achieve a maximum interest rate , which corresponds to a corresponding margin of the Libor .
I would be thank@@ ful for you to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by @-@ loan agreements with central banks of the credi@@ tors , if banks have a corresponding application .
I would be thank@@ ful for you to inform me of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;

the Parties shall meet all necessary measures to provide them from other Parties to form reag@@ ents for blood group determination of all incoming orders .
they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances quickly come quickly and in the shortest ways in Article 3 .
the contrac@@ tual parties give each other to the general election of the Council of Europe a list of places that are authorized to be published in Article 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these places should be identical in Article 6 of the European Convention on the Exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Convention is to mark the members of the Council of Europe on the signing ; they can sign party party by sign it a ) without reservation in rati@@ fication or permission .
this agreement occurs a month after the day in force , in which three members of the Council was signed by Article 7 , or rati@@ fy or rati@@ fied or approved .
for each member , which later signed or rati@@ fying the Convention or auth@@ orization , or rati@@ fy or rati@@ fy or approved , it joins into force a month after its signing or approval of the rati@@ fication .
the Convention can join the Council of the Council of Europe to join the Council of the Council of Europe to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the contribut@@ ors of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fy or rati@@ fy it without reservations ;
every party party can termin@@ ate this agreement with respect to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g the antibodies or another on the label &apos;s substance hom@@ olo@@ g .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not appear : a ) em@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
as a result , the Tit@@ er is measured in a suitable medium through the re@@ lu@@ ent of the re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es to the double in a suitable medium .
the Tit@@ er is the re@@ zi@@ est value of the number of the strongest serum , in which a reaction is occurs ; the di@@ lution will only be calculated from the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object dreams , activity is expressed by time , which is necessary for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination to the International Standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity will be processed in the current standards .
according to definition , an international standard prepar@@ ative contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ alised , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution with an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture inside a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ic is visible ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , for the International standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the international standard prepar@@ atory or state of state standards ( See Bulletin WHO , 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you return it to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ utes Serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative title of international standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended , its required properties should remain at least one year long .
the expi@@ ration date of a reag@@ ent in flu@@ x form according to the label is not one year after the last satisfactory effect .
the expi@@ ration date on the label , on the label , depends on the results of the durability tests . it is appro@@ ving by the government officials .
dried re@@ agen@@ ces are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ant gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass container , in which it has been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ acting may not lose at most 0,5 BC to its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or pent@@ oxide when it is tested within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solv@@ ent ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the reag@@ ent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements of speci@@ f@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin on blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml of flu@@ x or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
reag@@ ents , in@@ different , whether in flu@@ x form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
according to the international exchange , certain reag@@ ents for blood group determination should not be colored as possible , at least as long as the International Convention has come about a unified system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are in such a way and spread in such quantities that this is not only enough to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity must be so large in a tank , that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy of efficacy described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ laboratory has over all output levels and checks of the reag@@ ents for blood group @-@ related records .
adequate samples of all issued reag@@ ents are so long to store for the laboratory with some lik@@ el@@ ihood that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ents of reag@@ ents can contain substances human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary aid to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and conservation of the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are classified according to the origin of their real estate in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents contain no substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black @-@ and @-@ white label in English and French language which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , for dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the liquid @-@ solution needed liquid ,
in addition , this label or the label on the box , in which the individual containers are located , or which included the containers to contain the following details : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , for dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid @-@ solution needed liquid ,
each program is to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the attachment to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of the group B , which can be characterized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum served human red blood cells that include A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood group 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison par@@ at separated from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the server can be in no case less than 64 international units per ml .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with again , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood group servers or a standard prepar@@ atory of equal Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B Serum is extracted from the blood of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
anti @-@ B Serum acts as human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups B and AB ; there are no human body blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison of B @-@ blood cells .
if anti @-@ B Serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period , which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with again , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group servers , or with a standard shape of equal Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons in group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum levels human red blood cells , which includes Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A and / or B , i.e. those of group A , including sub @-@ groups A1 and A2 ; there are no human blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous A or B , i.e. those of group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated in the general by anti @-@ A serum of blood don@@ ors of group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison par@@ at , separated against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
at the same time , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison of B @-@ blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the server can be in no case less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a easily recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) has been mixed with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination should appear within the double time , which is necessary if the same experiments with which again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood group servers , or with a standard prepar@@ ative balance of the same activity .
if anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with again , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group servers or a standard prepar@@ atory of equal Avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of blood cells , so ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the pre@@ conditions in which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with others known as &quot; in@@ complete , &quot; a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be reached during presence of specific col@@ lo@@ ids , such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ers on object @-@ dre@@ ad@@ ings are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Sera regarding the determination of the R@@ h Group may possibly change when International standard prepar@@ ations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group vaccine ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood one or more people who are immun@@ ised through the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a ti@@ tre of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison @-@ par@@ at versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , which are intended to use objec@@ tors in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to have mixed ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood one or more , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these Sera are therefore specific to the C @-@ tigen , only if the tested blood cells are inhi@@ bited in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
the title of the anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Sera , which are intended to use objec@@ tors in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed if they have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood one or more people who are immun@@ ised through the an@@ tigen e @-@ system .
anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended to use objec@@ tors in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) , if they have mixed up on an object carrier with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent spread of c@@ c@@ dd@@ le@@ e blood cells within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of speci@@ f@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can immediately be obtained from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time .
if a serum is intended to use objec@@ tions according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous period in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction is not less than the ant@@ ine antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immune due to blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum served human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen that means those of blood @-@ groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are no human blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of blood @-@ groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the repeated , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison par@@ at , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the repeated , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood group servers or a standard prepar@@ atory of equal Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be detected by red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B .
anti @-@ B Serum acts as human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of blood @-@ groups B and AB ; there are no human body blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum , parallel to the repeated , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison of blood cells from the B group B to ti@@ tri@@ eren ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B Serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the repeated , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group servers , or with a standard prepar@@ atory of equal Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood @-@ group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ izing antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous antibodies against com@@ ple@@ mentary factors .
it is gained from the blood of animals , which are immune by injection of human serum proteins .
it is used according to the manufacturer , so ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ously does not include un@@ loaded human red blood cells , in@@ different from which blood group belong to them .

an anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum must cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of red blood cells , which are loaded with the human in@@ complete anti @-@ D Sera using a ti@@ tre of 1 : 4 ( or less ) if the title of D @-@ positive blood cells is carried out after the &quot; Alb@@ um@@ in method &quot; method .
in the same di@@ lution , the anti @-@ K anti @-@ positive human blood cells and the anti @-@ F@@ ya anti @-@ positive red blood cells is sensi@@ tively perceived to the weak anti @-@ K anti @-@ positive red blood cells .
in the same or another on the label , there must also be human red blood cells , which are sensitive to the presence of fresh human serum with weak comple@@ ment@@ ing in@@ complete anti @-@ Lea antibodies .
for clinical use , the charge with all types of the in@@ complete antibody should be det@@ ectable with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum .
anti @-@ A reag@@ ent is gained by extrac@@ ting from the seeds or other parts of an appropriate plant and appropriate cleaning .
the anti @-@ A reag@@ ent ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ anti@@ gens which means those of blood @-@ groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are no human blood cells that do not contain a A @-@ an@@ tigen , which means those of blood @-@ groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A reag@@ ent is parallel to the re@@ juven@@ ate , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood group servers , or a corresponding comparison par@@ at , separated against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells ( 1 ) .
in no case , the effectiveness of the reag@@ ent may amount to less than 64 international units per ml .
if anti @-@ A reag@@ ent is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt has been dissolved with again , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood group servers , or with a standard shape of equal treatment ( i@@ ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ acting ( veget@@ al )
anti @-@ B reag@@ ent is gained by extrac@@ ting from the appropriate part of an appropriate plant and appropriate cleaning .
the anti @-@ B reag@@ ent ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogenic B , which means those of blood cells B and AB ; there are no human blood cells that contains no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogenic B , which means those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
if anti @-@ B reag@@ ent is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent spread of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the repeated , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group servers or a standard prepar@@ atory of equal Avi@@ dity .
