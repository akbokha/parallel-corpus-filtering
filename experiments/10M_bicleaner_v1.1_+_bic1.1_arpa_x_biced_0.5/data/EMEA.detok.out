This document is a summary of the European Public Financial Report Report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Humanarztant (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.
If you require further information about your illness or their treatment, please read the pack of packing (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).
It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).
B. Acres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madments; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients lack a normal mood (periods of abnormal high-spirit) alternately with periods of normal mood.
Abollify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine.
Injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased agitation or behavioral disorders when the oral medication is not possible.
In both cases the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablets in patients, which make the swallow of tablets difficulties.
In patients who are using other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.
This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells themselves.
Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).
This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in smaller measurements than the neurotransmitter affects to activate the receptors.
Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin brings a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reduces psychotic or manic symptoms.
The effectiveness of Abilify, which prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year.
The efficacy of injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were compared to placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo.
In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperiidol in another study, to prevent the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in a different study compared to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.
The efficacy of Abilify injectionists was enrolled in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours compared.
In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.
The company also conducted studies to examine how the body readily absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intervene (decreases).
In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received a placebo.
In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.
Abilify prevented us up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.
Abollify injections decreased in 10- or 15-mg doses also effective as placebo perceived their symptoms of restlessness and were similar effective as Lorazepam.
The most common side effects of Abilify to intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (constant motion), tumulence (constipation), tumble hypersecretion (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.
The conclusion that led to the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes in the treatment of schizophrenia and from the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.
Moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injectionists in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manian episodes in Bipolar-I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.
In June 2004, the European Commission approved the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an authorization of the establishment of Abilify in the European Union.
ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate to serious episal episodes of Bipolar-I- disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients, mainly manic episodes, and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.
Increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.
With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justifiable (see section 4.4).
If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithmetic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
The occurrence of suicidal behaviours belong to mental disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or following an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).
Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder does not have increased suiciality risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.
Aripiprazole should be treated with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotension (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).
3 late dyskies: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskluft
If treated with ABILIFY, patients who occur signs and symptoms of a late dynasty should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.
If a patient developed signs and symptoms that indicate a mns or impaired high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be deposited, including ABILIFY.
Thus, Aripiprazole in patients with seizures in the history of seizures or states that are related with seizures in relation to caution.
56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients associated with psychoses that were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole in comparison to placebo.
There was, however, in one of those studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for undesirable vascular events treated with Aripiprazole patients.
Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.
There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.
Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.
In general, a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is observed and an unhealthy lifeline is observed and could lead to serious complications.
Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system is caution, when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with outlay side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
The H2-antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resignation of Aripiprazole, however, this effect is regarded as clinically irrelevant.
In a clinical study of healthy volunteers an effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.
It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed.
In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common use of high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations arise from Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.
If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should exceed potential risks for patients.
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteashibitors, must have similar effects, and therefore, similar dose reductions should be performed.
After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose of absorbing therapy before the start of the companion.
Diltiazem or CYP2D6, together with ABILIFY, can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.
In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazene) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic).
Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.
Due to inadequate data security to humans and due to the concerns of reproductive studies in the animal studies, this medication may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus.
However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against them, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.
The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):
The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); occasionally (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parathsonism, acathisie, Dystony and Dyskinthia, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperiidol (57.3%).
In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was placebo in patients with Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients.
In a different long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapin therapy.
Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from Haloperiidol treatment.
In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.
In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% treated with placebo.
A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were detected, did not mean medical significant differences.
Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipraole patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo treated patients.
Among the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskies and seizures, adverse mortality of dementia cases, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberated overdosies were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.
Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemoglizole in treatment with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that havalysis is in the treatment of an overflow of benefits, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding.
It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole with schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder has the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine di4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergen and the histamine-H1receptor.
During the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dosing-dependent reduction of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudus and at the plum.
In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.
In a week, 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities of patients who have a response to study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperiidol 73%).
Current values of measurement aspects, defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperiidol.
In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks on stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was below 34% in the Aripitiole Group and 57% in placebo.
In an ovlanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.
In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks of patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole demonstrated a placebo-superior effectiveness in the reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
In a placebo-controlled monootherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripitizole over to placebo no superior efficacy.
In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manian or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole demonstrated a placebo effect in week 3 and a maintenance effect, which was comparable to the lithium or Haloperiidol in week 12.
Aripiprazole also proved a comparative share of patients with symptomatic remission in the mania, such as lithium or Haloperiidol.
In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manian or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without mental characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks did not appear on lithium or Valproat-monotherapy at therapeutic Serpole. compared to monopoly symptoms in comparison to Monotherapy, with lithium or valproat.
10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion in certain patients that had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation, Aripiprazole showed up to placebo particularly in terms of prevention of a bipolar withdrawal.
Based on in vitro studies the CYP2D6 enzymes and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyde hydroxyzole by CYP3A4 by CYP3A4.
The average Eliminationshalbwerage is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolism about CYP2D6.
In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients had no sexually dependant effects.
A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of a smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.
The pharmacokinetic features of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripipraole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.
A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw on their metabolic capacity.
Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, reproductive-toxicity, genotoxicity and the candious potential to detect the preceptive data for human beings.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.
The effects remotest a dosisperant-niotic diseases (AUC) with rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 times the average maximum dose of cancer) and an increase of non-nib carcinoma and carcinoma at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times the medium-sized steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.
There was also Cholelioxic as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjugate of hydroxyzole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral surgery from 25 to 125 mg / kg (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on people based on mg / m2).
However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg in the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no longer than 6% of concentrations found in the study were found in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.
In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold in the medium-scale Steam State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.

46 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion in certain patients that had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation, Aripiprazole showed up to placebo particularly in terms of prevention of a bipolar withdrawal.
The recommended starting dose for Aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.
Patients who have difficulty at the swallow of ABILIFY tablets may take the melting tablets alternatively to ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2).
The occurrence of suicidal behaviours belong to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances following the onset or following an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).
Late dyskinarian: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskluft
Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, muscle tissues, changing consciousness failure and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachykarate, sweating and arrhythmias).
A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is observed and an unhealthy lifeline is observed and could lead to serious complications.
Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole
The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects of the medicine (*):

200 mg of fructose per ml 400 mg of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoat (E218) per ml 0.2 mg proyl-4-hydroxybenzoat (E216) per ml.
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).
To prevention the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received Aripiprazole, the therapy should be continued with the same dose.
Late dyskinarian: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskluft
Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.
There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.
92 In a clinical study of healthy volunteers an effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.
Diltiazem or CYP2D6, together with ABILIFY, can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.
Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was below Aripiprazol-
It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole with schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder has the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
In an ovlanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.
97 In a placebo-controlled monootherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripitizole over to placebo no superior efficacy.
In a relative bioavailability study, in which the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg of Aripiprazole was compared with healthy subjects, the ratio was between the geometric Cmax value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122% (N = 30).
99 Exceptional It was found as a result of the removal of Sulphate conjugate of hydroxyzole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral surgery from 25 to 125 mg / kg (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on people based on mg / m2).
In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold in the medium-scale Steam State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.
ABILIFY injection solution is used for rapid control of anxiety and behaviors in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manian episodes of the Bipolar-I disorder when a oral therapy is not appropriate.
Once there is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazole can be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazole.
To increase the absorption and minimize variability, injection is recommended to the M. deltoideus or deep in the gluteus-maximus muscle under bypassing of adipous regions.
A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be ordered depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acutely-therapy (see section 4.5).
If an advanced oral treatment with Aripiprazole indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug using ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY hot tablets or ABILIFY solution to intervene.
There are no investigation regarding the effectiveness of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with amicirculinity and behavioral disorders that were different from schizophrenia and manian episodes of the Bipolar-I disorder.
If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines additionally needed to be considered necessary, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure (see section 4.5).
Investigations of the safety and effectiveness of Aripiprazole injectionists are not present for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical poisoning (due to malice or illegal drugs).
Aripiprazole should be treated with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotension (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).
Late dyskinarian: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskluft
Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing consciousness failure and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachykarate, sweating and arrhythmias).
Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.
A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is observed and an unhealthy lifeline is observed and could lead to serious complications.
Nevertheless, intensity of Sedation was larger compared to the sole gift of Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) in a study which was intramusculated in healthy volunteers (15 mg dose) and intramusepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.
105 The H2-antagonist is famotidine, a gastric acid-blockers, decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, however, this effect is regarded as clinically irrelevant.
In the CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the joint application of CYP2D6 can result with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations.
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, must have similar effects, and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed.
After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose of absorbing therapy before the start of the companion.
106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly, the intensity of Sedation was larger compared to the sole gift of Aripiprazole.
The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):
The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined after the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
107 The following side effects occurred more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) as possible (see Section 5.1):
In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was placebo in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients.
In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.
In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated with Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% treated with placebo.
A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were detected, did not mean medical significant differences.
Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipraole patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo treated patients.
Among the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskies and seizures, adverse mortality of dementia cases, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
110 and behavioral disturbances was statistically significant compared to placebo and behaviors compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperiidol.
In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder and attitudes and behavioral disorders, the Aripiprazole solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding asgibility and behavioral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.
The observed middle improvement of the initial value on the PANSS excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.
In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes, or patients with severe aggitives, a similar effectiveness in relation to total population was observed, but a statistical significance could be observed due to a reduced patient population.
In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.
In a week, 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities of patients who have a response to study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and Haloperiidol 73% in both groups.
Current values of measurement aspects, defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperiidol.
In a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.
In an ovlanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.

In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks, followed by a 74-week study expansion in certain patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before Randomanization, Aripiprazole showed up to placebo particularly in the prevention of a bipolar withdrawal.
The Aripiprazole AUC is in the first 2 hours following intramuscular injection 90% greater the AUC according to the same dose as tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.
In 2 trials with healthy volunteers the average time to reach the maximum plasma cable for 1 to 3 hours after application.
The gift of Aripipraole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkey, and resulted in any direct toxicity of a target system after repeated treatment with systemic exposure (AUC), the 15- and 5 times over the maximum humtherapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.
In studies for reproductive treatment after intravenous application, there was no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humtherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.
Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for security harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, reproductive-toxicity, genotoxicity and the candious potential to detect the preceptive data for human beings.
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.
The effects remotest a dosisex-drug-accumulation and / or parenchymcell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20-60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 times the average non-state-state exposure (AUC) during the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.
There was also Cholelioxic as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjugate of hydroxyzole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral surgery from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on people based on mg / m2).
In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11-fold in the middle-level AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.

Abraxane should only be used under the supervision of a qualified oncologists in the application of cytostatika (reduction of cells) specialized departments.
In patients where certain side effects occur on the blood or the nervous system, the dose may be reduced or interrupted.

The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously produced an anthracycline.
The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with a conventional paclitaxel containing drug (given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects).
In total, 72 (31%) of 229 treated with Abraxane treated patients on the treatment compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.
Considering only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there were no difference between pharmaceuticals as time as to deterioration of the disease and survival.
In contrast, in patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.
It may also not be used in patients, the silent or prior to the treatment of low neutrophelpers in the blood.
The Committee for Human Immunology (CHMP) noted that Abraxane in patients with whom the first treatment could not be more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines are not necessary to reduce adverse reactions to other medicines in contrast to other medicines.
January 2008, the European Commission granted the Company Abrasives Bioscience Limited granted permission to privatize Abraxane in the entire European Union.
Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first-line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not displayed in standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see section 4.4).
In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophelper < 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory Neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2.
At sensory Neuropathy grade 3, the treatment is to interrupt until a better level 1 or 2 is achieved, and at all the following cycles must be reduced.
There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dosisadaptations in patients with mild to excessive impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).
There were no clinical studies conducted with patients suffering from kidney function, and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to unsufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness.
Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanopartic-forming of paclitaxel that could be essentially different pharmacological features than other forms of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).
If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately, and the patient should not be treated with paclitaxel again.
In patients no new Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated, until the neutrophelper rose again to > 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte has increased again to > 100 x 109 / l.
Patients with serious liver function disorders (Bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT > 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.
While a unique Abraxane was not detected in connection with Abraxane, cardiac incidents in the indexed patient-collective are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or kidney disease or lung disease.
If patients occur after the gift of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, these can be treated with common antiemeal and constifficient funds.
Abraxane should not be practiced at pregnant or women in a buoyant age, which does not practice an effective receiver of contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is incorruptible.
Women in common age should use a reliable reference method for up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.
Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised during and up to six months after the treatment of no child.
Male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm hospital, since the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of an irreversible infertility.
Abraxane can cause adverse events such as tiredness (very frequent) and dizziness (frequently), which can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines.
These are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated in the pivotal phase III clinical trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane.
Neutropenia was the most remarkable hmatological toxicity (79% of patients reported) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; Leukopenie was reported in 71% of patients.
Anemia (Hb < 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb < 8 g / dl).
Table 1 specifies the side effects that occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abraxane as a monotherapy in any dose and indication in studies (N = 789).
Very common (≥ 1 / 10, < 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1,000); very rare (< 1 / 10,000).
Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:
Dysphagie, flatulls, tongue-burning, dry mouth, mergophagitis, pain in underwear, sores in mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract:
Pain in the breast tissue, weakness of musculature, gene pain, suffering pain, muscle pain, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the songs, muscle weakness Very often:
Restlessness 1 The frequency of the hypersensitivity interaction is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients
Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events.
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli-drug that promotes merging the microtubules from the Tubular indigenes and stabilized the microtubules by inhibiting their deolymerisation.
This stabilization leads to a inhibit of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.
It is known that Albumin conveys the Transcytosis of plasmacomcomponents in the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.
It is assumed that this enhanced transendocking transport is mediated by the gp-60-Albuminogen receptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (opted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the range of tumors.
The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two catardy-blind studies and 454 patients who were randomised in a randomized Phase III comparison study.
In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane which was given in form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.
In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
This multicentric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received every 3 weeks a monotherapy with paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premeasurement of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 than 30-minute infusion with no premediation (N = 229).
In the study, 64% of patients had an affected general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestellen.
14% of patients had not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% for metastasis and 19% for metastasification and adjuvant treatment.
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive > First-line therapy are shown below.
Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 evaluated.
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for abortion on Baseline, due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and is still unknown.
The pharmacokinetics of total-paclitaxel according to 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.
The effect position (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.
10 In the recommended clinical dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel-Plasmaconenta has increased to a multi-phase modulation.
The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extravascular distribution and / or crossover network of paclitaxel.
In a study of patients suffering from late solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of soluble paclitaxel.
The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) than according to a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).
In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that paclitaxel is primarily reduced to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3 "-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).
After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was 4% of the given total dose of less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a vast non-renal Clearance.
However, over 75 years of age, however, only a few data are available, because only 3 patients took part in the pharmacokinetic analysis.
The chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and before light light protected by 8 hours.
Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic carcinogenic drug and, as well as other potentially toxic substances should be maintained in dealing with Abraxane caution.
Using a sterile syringe end, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane flow rate.
After full addition the solution should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a solid use of the solid material.
Then the tear-bottle for at least 2 minutes is slow and cautious and / or inverted until a complete reset suspension of the powder is performed.
If prunuding or lubricants are visible, the side bottle must be once more gently inverted in order to achieve a complete reset suspension in order to apply a complete reset.
The overall dosing volume of the 5-mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the non-constitutional Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterilised PVC- or non-PVC infusion bag.

In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decay in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children).
The Iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency consists of iron weight, and iron supplement should be given throughout the treatment.
In patients who received chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems can cause anemia caused by a erythropoetine deficiency or by means that the body does not suffice to the body's own erythropoietin.
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss.
It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of epoxettin alfa.
Abseamed was placed as an injection into a Vene in the context of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, compared to the reference agent.
All of the patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a Vene, before they were either placed on sevending or remain Eprex / Erypo.
Major indicators for the effectiveness was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25-29.
In addition, the company reported the results of a study in which the effects were examined by the skin injected abortions with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 patients who received chemotherapy.
In the study involving patients who suffer from kidney problems caused Anemia, the haemoglobin values of patients who were placed on abseamed were obtained in the same degree as for those patients who continue to keep Eprex / Erypo.
In contrast, patients who continue to keep Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.
The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure which may occasionally cause symptom of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, side-violent headaches and confusion.
Sevending may not be applied in patients that are possibly excessive (allergic) against epoxettin alfa or any of the other components.
Seamed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that these are caused by no allergic reactions.
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that the medicine has been achieved for abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.
The company, which abuses abseamed, is informational for medical specialists in all Member States information, including information about the security of the drug.
In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG an authorization of placing abseamed in the entire European Union.
Treatment of anemia and reduction of the transaction needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplem myeloma who received chemotherapy and in which the risk of a transfusion due to general condition (for example, cardiovascular status, anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).
Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, for planned major operating interventions (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).
The reduction of foreign blut can be applied in front of a large electrophic procedure in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusions can be expected.
HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml are applied to participate in an autologous blood dontic program.
The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pädiatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration is between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).
Bacterial symptoms and folklets can vary depending on the age, gender and total disease of disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease insurrection is required by the doctor.
A rise in hemoglobins in order to avoid more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.
Due to the variability between patients may occasionally be observed in an patients individual haemoglobin above or under the hemoglobin target concentration.
In view of these hemoglobbinvariability the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) can be reached by 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).
If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxettin-alfa dose is increased by 25%.
The patients should be supervised to ensure that epoxetalfa is in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anemia and anesthetic symptoms.
The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (< 6 g / dl or < 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance outlets than patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb > 8 g / dl or > 5 mmol / l).
The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (< 6.8 g / dl or < 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance outlets than patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb > 6.8 g / dl or > 4.25 mmol / l).
Starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose of dose of 25 mg / kg (three times per week), until the desired destination is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).
Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on the age, gender and total disease of disease; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor.
In view of these hemoglobbinvariability the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) can be reached by 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).
The patients should be supervised to ensure that epoxetalfa is in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of mitigation symptoms.
If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the vertical intake increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 kg / kg should be maintained three times per week or 450 people / kg once a week.
If the haemoglobin increase < 1 g / dl (< 0,62 mmol / l) and the vertical intake of < 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 i.e. / kg three times per week.
If after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e. / kg three times a week of hemoglobin value by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the vertical intake of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl has to be preserved three times per week.
However, the haemoglobite value increased by < 1 g / dl (< 0,62 mmol / l) or the vertical intake increased by < 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoxettin-alfa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off.
Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33-39%), with which the pre-caring deposits of ≥ 4 blood-conservative should be required, abseamed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.
With the iron substitution, as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood dontic program, we started to have large iron reserves before the start of the Abseamed therapy.
6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg epoxetalfa, which should be given a week for three weeks (Day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and the day of intervention (Day 0).
In this case epoxetalfa was given preoperatively 300 i.e. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards.
Alternatively, injection can be given at the end of dialysis on the hose of a fistle pin, followed by 10 ml isotonical cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.
Patients suffering from treatment with any erythropoetin in a erythroblastopenia (Pure Red Cell Acouasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenia).
Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venison ones (e.g. anamnestically known venous Thromboembolien).
In patients who are intended for a larger electrophic procedure, the application of epoxetric diseases can be detected, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently built-to-scale heart attack or cerebrovascular event.
Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months and years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.
In patients with sudden loss of loss, the reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need of transfusions should be determined and the customary causes for non-speaking (ice, foldacid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium-loss and hemolysis) are examined.
If the tikulocyte value is lower, considering the anemia (i.e. the retikulocytes), and if no other cause is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined, and an investigation of the bone marchmarks to diagnose a PRCA diagnosis.
The data for immunogeneity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed for patients with a risk of anti-corrosive Treatment (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.
8. patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not be exceeded below the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.
In clinical studies, an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) have been given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).
Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epochetine if the haemoglobin concentration will be increased to the control of mitigation symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions required concentration.
The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase of hypertension.
In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidence incoronary artery disease or insufficiency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.
According to the terms of the detection of anemia with epoxetine alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not dialysis, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.
In tumour patients, chemotherapy was supposed to be able to assess the treatment of therapy efficiency of epoxetalfa a 2-3-week delay between epoxetine-alfa drugs and the erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transfunised).
If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l) to minimize the risk of possible thrombal events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical therapies - Dosiscustomization with the aim to keep the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).
The decision for the application recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit of risk reduction in the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
In patients who are intended for a larger electropic procedure should be, if possible, before the beginning of epoxetine alfa treatment, the cause of anemia is investigated and treated accordingly.
Patients who undergo a larger electrophic procedure should have an appropriate Thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, it can not be excluded that treatment with epoxetine alfa for patients with an output of an aleroglobin value of > 13 g / dl is an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.
In several controlled studies, epochine was not demonstrated that they improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia.
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy once a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted
Epoxetalfa is used along with ciculporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Cicrid indoors should be adjusted to increasing hematocrit.
In vitro studies in vitro studies, there are no indication of an interaction between epoxettin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematology differentiation or proliferation.
Over thrombo, vascular events such as myocardiology, cerebral palmess, arterial Thromblooses, pulmonary arteries, litigysmen, retinal diseases, aneurysmen, retinal diseases and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epoxpoetin treatment, as well as patients with epoxetine alfa.
The most common side effect during the treatment with epoxettin alfa is a dosing dependent of blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.
Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetins.
Regardless of the erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular and vascular complications.
The genetically modified epittin alfa is glycosiated and relative to the amino acids and carbohydrates of carbohydrates, identical with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine in local patients.
It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marines that epoxettin stimulates the erythropoesis and does not affect the Leukopoese.
389 patients with hemostentless (221 multiple myelomas, 144 non-Hodgkin- lymphomas and 24 other hemmoblastomas) and 332 patients with solid tumors (172 mammoth carcinomas, 64 gynaecological cancer, 22 prostate cancer, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas, and 30 more).

Survival and discontinuations were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled trials and
In the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin-treated patients and the controls.
In these studies the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin treated patients with anemia due to various frequent malignancies consistent, statistically significantly higher mortality rate than the controls.
Overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and associated complications in combination with recombinant human erythropoetin treated patients and inspections satisfactory.
There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events with tumor patients who are treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded.
It is not clarified how far these results are applied to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a haemoglobin less than 13 g / dl, as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.
Epoxetine-alfa-determinant after repeated intravenous application revealed a half-day period of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half-time period of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.
After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoxettin alfa are much lower than the serum levels, which are achieved by intravenous injection.
There are no cumulation: the serum levels remain equal, regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.
(bone marfibrosis is a well-known compensation of chronic renal insufficiency in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.
In a study on hemalysis patients, the three years with epoxettin alfa were treated, the incidence of bone marfibrosis was treated with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoxettin alfa.
14 in animal trials with nearly the 20 counts of application during the recommended weekly daily dose of epetin alfa led to reduced födy body weight, to a delay of oscillation and to a rise of maternal mortality.
These reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumor cells, but for the clinical situation however of uncertain significance.
As part of the outpatient application, the patient can store Abseamed only for a period of maximum 3 days outside the refrigeration and not exceed 25 ° C.

Furthermore, an upgraded RMP should be submitted: • For obtaining new information that may have influence on the current safety specifications (Safety Specification), the pharmacovigilance plan or the measures for risk reduction? within 60 days after reaching a significant (the pharmacovigilance or risk reduction) milestones • to request by the EMEA
• During a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or a stroke, • if you suffer an unstable angina pectoris (for the first time or reinforced chest pain), the danger of a blood flow in the veins (deep ventional mbloosen), if you have occurred before, for example, occurred in such a bloodstream.
You in severe blood circulation disorders of the heart (coronary artery disease), arteries of legs or arms (peripheral arterial disease), the cervical disease (vascular disease of the cerebral disease) or brain (cerebrovascular disease), you have recently had a heart attack or stroke.
During treatment with Abseamed, it may occur within the norm of a slight dosisite increase in blood pressure numbers that will return to further treatment.
Your doctor will, if necessary, carry out regular blood tests to control the number of blood samples during the first 8 weeks of treatment.
Iron deficiency, resolution of red blood cells (haemolysis), blood-loss, vitamin B12- or folly deficiency, should be considered and before the start of therapy with abseamed.
Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia after months to years of subcutaneous treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.
If you suffer from erythroblastopenia, it will break your therapy with abseamed and defining how your anemia is best treated.
Therefore, abortions have to be given into a vein (intravenous) if you are treated due to anemia due to kidney disease.
A high hemoglobin value increases the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels and the death of death could be increased.
When increased or increasing calibre, your doctor may consider a interruption of treatment with abseamed up, until the potassium values lie back in the normal range.
If you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clinically obvious coronary artery disease or dust marks, your doctor will ensure that your hemoglobbination does not exceed a particular value.
According to the present knowledge, blood insufficiency patients with chronic kidney disease (renal insufficiency), which are still not dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.
A 2-3-week delay between epoxetine-alfa drugs and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for the assessment of efficacy.
200 your doctor regularly determine your values of red blood material (hemoglobin) and adjust your abseamed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood flow (thrombo event) as possible.
This risk should be very carefully weighed from the treatment with epoxetine alfa if you have an elevated risk of thrombotic vascular events, for example if you have already had thrombal vascular events (e.g. a deep ventional mbosis or pulmonary embolie).
If you are cancer patients, consider that Abseamed like a growth factor for blood cells and can affect the tumor negative under certain circumstances.
If a larger orthopaedic operation is imminent, treatment begins with abseamed the cause of your anemia should be investigated and treated accordingly.
If your values of red blood material (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not receive abseamed because an elevated risk of blood flow formation after surgery.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when you use other medicines / apply or applied recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.
If you take Cicrid porin (means to suppression the immune system) during your treatment with abseamed vapour, your doctor may cause certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cicrid porin.
Laboratory studies have no interaction between epoxetine alfa and G-CSF or GM CSF (G-CSF and GM-CSF) to build the immune system, for example with cancers (chemotherapy or HIV).
Depending on the treatment of your blood (anemia), the dose may be adapted for every four weeks until your condition is under control.
Your doctor will then arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your hemoglobin value.
Once you are set well, you will receive regular doses of seams between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice a week, spread on two equal injections.
Your doctor will then arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and make sure your haemoglobster does not exceed a particular value.
Depending on how the anemia comes to treatment, the dose may be adapted for every four weeks until the condition is under control.
To ensure that, ensuring that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a particular value, the treatment doctor will carry out regular blood tests.
If necessary, treatment time before surgery can be shortened before surgery, a dose of 300 i.e. / kg to 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery.
However, if your doctor is appropriate for this, you can also learn how to splitting yourself under the skin itself.
Heart, heart attacks, brain bleeding, stroke of cerebral palepiderless, arterial Thromblooses, pulmonary arteries, vascular epidermis, pulmonary fibrosis and blood cots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment.
Eyelids and lips (Quincke oils) and shock allergic reactions with symptoms such as cribingling, redness, itching, heat-feeling, and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases.
Erythroblastopenie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Specific caution when using Absevened is required").
After repeated bleeding, it may occur independently of the treatment with Abseamed - to a blood flow formation (thrombotic vascular events).
Treatment with Abseamed may result in increased risk of blood prop after surgery (post-operative thrombal vascular events) when your starting point is too high
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or if you notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.
If a syringe from the fridge has been taken and room temperature (up to 25 ° C), it must either be used or discarded within 3 days.
Aclasta is used for the treatment of the following diseases: osteoporosis (a disease which makes the bone brittle) both in women as well as in men.
It is applied in patients with a high fractional risk of risk (bone break), including in patients who had suffered a straumatic vintment as it drops out; • Morbus Paget the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.
In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip-correction should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) oral or injection in a muscle.
The administration of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen (means against inflammation) just after the application of Aclasta can result in the three days after infusion symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.
To treat the Morbus Paget, Aclasta must only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.
Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is as in the zometa, a part of the data material was attracted to the review of Aclasta.
In the first study, nearly 8 000 older women were involved with osteoporosis and it was investigated the number of vertebrates and hips over a period of three years.
The second study involved 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years which had been recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures were examined over a period of up to five years.
At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.
The main indicators for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that builds a bone substance) in the blood once again normalized or reduced by at least 75% compared to the initial value.
In the study involving older women the risk of vertebrates in patients under Aclasta (without any Osteoporosis accounts) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70%.
In comparison of all patients under Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis) the risk of hips was reduced by 41%.
In the study involving males and women with hip-correction 9% of patients under Aclasta had a questionnaire (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients with placebo (139 from 1 062).
Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.
Aclasta must not be used in patients that are possibly excessive (allergic) against Zoledronylic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.
As in all Bisphosphonates, patients in Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteodeficiency (extinction of bone tissue) in the jaws.
The manufacturer of Aclasta provides clarifying material for physicians, which contains evidence of osteoporosis, as well as the similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug may be explained and pointed out, when they should apply to the doctor.
In April 2005, the European Commission granted the Novartis Europharm Limited approval for the establishment of Aclasta in the European Union.

Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk for fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hilarching.
The patient information package should be provided, and the following nuclear messages include: • The packets of contraindications in pregnancy and in breastfeeding women • require adequate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When focused on medical or nursing aid
Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women in men with increased risk for fractures, including in patients with a recently inquered low-traumatic clutture.
For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in males one intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.
In patients with a low-traumatic hilarment, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).
For the treatment of Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Morbus Paget.
After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta a long pension period in patients have been observed (see Section 5.1).
In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).
In patients with a recent low-traumatic kegel-correction, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 i.e. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.
The frequency of symptoms, which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the gift of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.
Patients with kidney function (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine-Clearance < 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as a limited clinical experiences for this patient group.
Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.
Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because data are missing for uncertainty and effectiveness.
Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinine-Clearance < 35 ml / min) for patients with only limited clinical experiences.
A pre-existing hypokalemia is before the start of therapy with Aclasta to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).
Because of the rapid submission of the effect of Zoledroneic acid on the bone structure, a transitory hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum is usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).
In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).
Cancers, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene, should be obtained from a use of bisphosphonates a dentification with reasonable pre-relief dental treatment.
For patients who require dental access, no data are available if the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecologists in the jaw area.
The clinical assessment by the treatment physician should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefits of risk assessment.
The frequency of symptoms, which occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the gift of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen shortly after the use of Aclasta (see section 4.2).
The prevalence of adverse events reported in patients who received Aclasta was increased (1.3%) (51%) (51%) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).
In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, Horizon - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the totality of provisions between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.
Very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1,000) unwanted drugs effects are listed in table 1.
Kidney function Zoledroneic acid was associated with kidney function, which is associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase of kidney cancer) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure in connection.
The variation of the creatinine-Clearance (measured each year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure, as well as a restricted kidney function in the clinical trial of osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.
A temporary increase in serum-creatins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta patients compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.
Based on the evaluation of the laboratory results, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuations in a large clinical study, treated patients compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.
All patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip-correction and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).
In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent keepers, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).
Local reactions after administration of Zoledronylic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).
Osteonekrosen in the jaw area was accidental primarily in cancer patients, via osteonecrosen (primarily in the jaw area) reported with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronylic acid.
Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental.
7 study with 7,736 patients with osteodeficiency in the jaw area at an area of Aclasta and in a placebo treated patients.
In case of an overflow that leads to a clinical-relevant hypokalemia, can be reached by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intravenous infusion of calcium gluconat.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (BMD) or a BMD T score for the Schenkelheck ≤ -2.5 with or without any indication of an existing fluidities.
Effects on morphometric fluxes Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebrates (see Table 2).
Aclasta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebrates compared to placebo patients (p < 0.0001).
Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk for hip fractures.
Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar vertebra, hips and the distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly compared to all ages (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).
9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine increased by 6.7%, of the total thigh around 6.0%, the steering angle of 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.
Bone histology at 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients who were treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic bone.
A micro-computerized (µCT) analysis showed in patients treated with Aclasta to placebo an increase of the trabecular bone volume and obtaining the trabecular bone architecture.
Bone structure marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of the type I- collagen (b-CTx) in serum samples were measured in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodically interval during the study period.
Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.
P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.
B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value in 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.
The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured by routinely, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 - 125,000, oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.
The overall mortal was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.
Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in the Horizon RFT study increased the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo-treatment the BMD on the totals and scrapers at all points of time.
The Aclasta therapy resulted in the placebo-treatment for 24 months to increase the BMD by 5.4% in the total air and 4.3% at the cockatop.
Clinical efficacy in males In the Horizon RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.
The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures amounted to 7.5% in Aclasta-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.
In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta was reduced to the percentage change in the progression of the lumber vertebrae-BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.
Clinical efficacy of treatment with Morbus Paget des bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirming, particularly light up to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6x to 3,0fold-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronylic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparative studies.
In combination with the combined results, a similar decrease in the pain relief and pain relief was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronate.
Patients who were classified at the end of the six months main study on the therapy were classified (on the therapy), could be taken into an obituary phase.
Patients who took part in the follow-up study was 141 of the patients who attended the follow-up study compared with 71 members of patients treated with Risedron, compared with 71 who were treated with craedronate in the middle duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.
Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes persevering infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronylic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.
After that, the plasma torch increased rapidly to < 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and < 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase, no more than 0,1% of the maximum value.
Rapid-phase of disappearance from the great cycle of half-time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ h 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with an terminale Elimination shale-life t ½ γ 146 hours.
The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent quick absorption in the bones and excretion of the kidneys.
In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the prescribed dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.
The total body Clearance is independent from the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.
Extension of the infusion-time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).
A reduced Clearance by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledronylic acid is not metabolic because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, non-dependent inhibitor of the P450-
Special patients (see section 4.2) of the Zoledronylic acid correlated with the creatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and at the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).
This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney disorder until down to a creatinine-Clearance until 35 ml / min does not require Dosission of the Zoledronic acid.
Due to severe kidney disorder (creatinable Clearance < 30 ml / min) only limited data are not possible for this population.
Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.
In studies in dogs were single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.
Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was determined with intravenous dose of Zoledronylic acid in 3 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to 6 times in 3 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of the human therapeutic exposure referred to the AUC, corresponding to AUC).
In long-term studies with repeated application of accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.
The most common clinical trials with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dosages, a fertilization, which reflects pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.
In rats, one observed a teratogenicity with dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as an external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and the skeleton of skeletal.
There were no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects although the maternal toxicity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum-calcium levels.
If the medicine is not directly used, the user is responsible for the preparation period and conditions before the application; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C and 8 ° C are not exceeded.
Aclasta is delivered as a package with a bottle as packing unit or as a bundle package consisting of 5 packages, each containing a bottle.

Zoledronylic acid is a representative of a subclass that is called bisphosphonate, and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Morbus Paget of the bone.
Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, primarily estrogens, which are made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men.
In the Morbus Paget the bone structure takes place fast, and new bone material is subordinated, which makes bone material weaker than normal.
Aclasta works by reforming the bone structure, thereby making a normal bone formation and ensures that the bone is restarted again.
If you are in dental treatment or use a dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.
When using Aclasta with other drugs. please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use other medicines / apply or applied recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.
For your doctor, it is especially important to know if you are using medicines that damage the kidneys.
When using Aclasta together with food and beverages, you are worried that you may take enough fluid according to your doctor's instructions before and after the treatment with Aclasta.
Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, which is given to you by your doctor or care specialists in an infusion.
If you recently have broken the hips, it is recommended to take the administration of Aclasta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip.
Morbus Paget The usual dose is 5 mg, which is given to you by your doctor or care specialists in an infusion.
Since Aclasta seems for a long time, you may also need a further dose for a year or longer.
It is important to follow these instructions closely to that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after infusion.
With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can act longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.
If the administration of Aclasta was missed, you will immediately agree with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new date.
Before terminating treatment with Aclasta Falls you are considering the treatment with Aclasta considering taking your next doctor's min and discuss it with your doctor.
Side effects associated with the first infusion is very frequent (with more than 30% of patients), but after the subsequent infusion but less frequently.
Fever and chills, muscle, joint pain, headache, occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.
At the moment it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should notice if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.
Physical signs due to a low calcium concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or crawling or deaf feeling, especially in the area around the mouth.
Flu, sleeplessness, tiredness, critique, pain pain, nausea, skin pain, skin pain, skin rash, syringing, skin rash, sweat, itching, skin rash, syringing, syringing, syringes, skin rash, skin rash, skin rash, skin rash, skin conditions and thirst.
Persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaws were reported mostly in patients who were treated with bisphosphonates because of other illnesses.
Allergic reactions, including rare cases of respiratory problems, caults and angioedema (such as swelling in the face, tongue or throat) was reported.
Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff, if one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not listed in this manual information.
If the medicine is not directly used, the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C are not exceeded.
In patients with one before recently, low-traumatic hips was recommended, the infusion of Aclasta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fracture.
Before and after administration of Aclasta patients have to be sufficient for patients with fluid; this is particularly important in patients who received diuretic therapy.
Because of the rapid introduction of the effect of Zoledroneic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokalemia can develop, the maximum is usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta.
In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta.
In patients with one before recently, low-traumatic hips, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000, i.e. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended to infusion of Aclasta.
If you require further information about your illness or their treatment, please read the pack of packing (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
ACOMPLIA is additionally applied to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity (body mass index - BMI) of 30 kg / m ² or above or are overweight (BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above) and beyond or more.
In addition, four trials have been carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which ACOMPLIA was employed in comparison to placebo as an support of the smoking.
The studies on the setting of the smoking showed no uniform results, so the effect of ACOMPLIA was difficult to intervene on this application area.
What risk is associated with ACOMPLIA? he is the most common side effects of ACOMPLIA, which were detected during studies (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients), Nausea (nausea) and infections of the upper respiratory system reported adverse effects associated with ACOMPLIA reported side effects.
It may also be applied to patients who suffer from an existing serious depression or treated with antidepressants, since it can cause the risk of depression and cause problems with a small minority of patients superficidal thoughts.
Caution is provided with simultaneous application of ACOMPLIA with medication such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (medicines for fungal infections), rite avir (a remedy for use in HIV- infection), Telithromycin or Clarithromycin (antibiotics).
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the effectiveness of ACOMPLIA with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
Drug may be applied to patients who need it from health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons (by providing reconnaissance packages for patients and physicians), and around the Arz
In addition to diet and motion for treatment of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg / m ²) or overweight patients (BMI > 27 kg / m ²), which are beyond one or several risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidemia (see Section 5.1).
ACOMPLIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to misleading data regarding the effectiveness and uncertainty.
La depressive disease or mood changes with depressive symptoms were reported in up to 10%, suicidal thanks to up to 1% of patients who received Rimonabant (see Section 4.8).
If Rimonabant may not be applied in depressive disorders, unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case exceeds the risk (see section 4.3 and 4.8).
It also in patients who are concerned - in addition to obesity - no visible risks can occur, depressive reactions can occur.
Relatives or other sedentalers) indicate that it is necessary to monitor the new symptoms of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur. ln
• Elder patients' effectiveness and uncertainty of Rimonabant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown enough.
Patients with an cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or stroke, etc.) before less than 6 months, studies with Rimonabant were completed.
Rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St John's wort) is believed to be the simultaneous gift of potent CYP3A4 inductors for the plasma concentration of Rimonabant
SSE survived important patients as well as patients with obesity, and in addition to 3800 patients in other indications.
The following table (Table 1) shows the adverse adverse effects of placebo-controlled effects in placebo-controlled studies in patients who were treated to weight loss and for the treatment of retinal diseases.
If the incidence was statistically significantly higher than the corresponding placebo (for unwanted effects ≥ 1%) or if they were clinically relevant (for unwanted effects < 1%). ng With the evaluation of side effects, the following characteristics shall be considered:
Very frequent (≥ 10%); frequently (≥ 1, < 10%); occasionally (≥ 0.1, < 1%); rare (≥ 0,01, < 0.1%); very t lä
In a tolerant study, in which a limited number of individuals were given up to 300 mg, only slight symptoms were observed.
Patients had a BMI ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BMI > 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dyslipidemia.
N weight reduction after one year stood for ACOMPLIA 20 mg of 6.5 kg, relative to the initial value, compared to 1.6kg for the placebo group (difference -4,9 kg CI95% -5.3; -4,4, p < 0.001).
Patients who were treated with ACOMPLIA 20 mg, and 1.2 kg in the placebo group (difference between -3,8 kg; CI95% -4,4, -3,3; p < 0.001).
After 2 years the difference in the total weight reduction between ACOMPLIA and placebo -4,2 kg (CI95% -5,0%; -3,4, p < 0,001).
9 weight reduction and further risk factors in studies in patients without diabetes, in which a mixed population of patients with
Under Rimonabant 20 mg, an average waste of triglycerides was seen by 6.9% (initial triglycerides 1.62 mmol / l) compared to an increase of 5.8%.
In a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes (Serenade), the absolute change of the HbA1c value (with an initial value of 7.9% for both groups) after 6 months -0.8 in Rimonabant 20 mg and -0.3 below placebo
The percentage of patients who reached a HbA1c- value of < 7% was 51% in the Rimonabant Group and 35% in the placebo group.
The difference between the average weight change between the 20 Mg- and the placebo group was 3.8 kg (CI95% 5.0, -2.6 p < 0.001).
Improvement of the HbA1c value in patients who had eaten Rimonabant 20 mg were approximately 50% caused by direct effects of Rimonabant and about 50% due to the weight reduction.
2 hours achieved, the Steady State Plasmaspens were achieved after 13 days (Cmax = 196 ± 28.1 ng / ml; Cengh = 91,6 ± 14,1 ng / ml; AUC0-24 = 2960 ± 268 ng.h / ml).
The influence of food: he subjects who received Rimonabant either in the treasury state or after a low-fat meal, in the case of food supply a 67% increased Cmax or by 48% increased ng AUC.
Patients with black skin color allows up to 31% less cmax and one at 43% lower AUC than patients of other ethnic populations.
N populationspharmacroinetic analyses (age range 18- 81 years) is estimated that a 75- year-old patient is a 21% higher cmax and one at 27% higher AUC than a 40-year-old
5.3 Evidence of clinical data for safety he undesirable effects that have not been observed in clinical trials, but they were considered possibly relevant in animals after exposure in human therapeutic areas, as potentially relevant for clinical use:
In some cases, however, in all cases, the beginning of convulsions with process-related stress has to be associated with animals.
Has been given Rimonabant over a longer period before pairing (9 weeks), which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rimonabant, so no undesired effects observed for fertility or cyclamen.
The influence of Rimonabant on the pre- and postnatal development was studied at rates in dosages of up to 10 mg / kg / day.
In a study of rats for pre- and postnatal development caused an exposure with Rimonabant in utero and using lactose no changes during learning behavior or in memory.

Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Services Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanarztant (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the use of the medicine.
Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can't be used in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a cancer medicine) can be applied together with other cancer medicine (dualtherapy).
It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.
In combination with a sulphonyl harnant or insulin, the previous dose of sulphonylharnal or insulin can be preserved with the onset of acetylemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonylharnal or insulin.
This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized better and the blood sugar level is reducing, enabling type 2 diabetes better.
In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetate was studied in Tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl harnant, in addition they received either acetone or placebo for up to 3.5 years.
In the studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glyceral hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted.
Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.
At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of the addition to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylharnant showed a 0.94% reduction, while the additional cure from placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.
In a small study in which the combination of acetone and insulin were examined at 289 patients, the patients who received acetone in addition to insulin, a decrease in the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo.
The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to stimulants).
Acting must not react in patients, which may react sensitively to pioglitazone or one of the other components, even with patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirror - acidration).
It was decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (in the sole use) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not displayed.
In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing Actos in the European Union.

Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and with which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility is not suitable (see section 4.4).
For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.
In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.
Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.
Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.
A cardiac Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease was carried out.
In this study, an increase in heart failure showed, however, which led not to an increase in mortality in the study.
In patients with increased output of liver enzymes (ALT > 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of the liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.
If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are the liver-enzymatic values as soon as possible.
If a patient developed symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymatic values.
The decision, whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone continued to be continued, should be led to the presence of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.
In clinical trials with pioglitazone, dosing-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be stirring by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.
As a result of a hematology, under the therapy with pioglitazone, a slight reduction in intermediate haemoglobon (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).
Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits in patients under sulfonylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).
As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two-way combination therapy with a sulfonylharnstoff or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglycemia.
After the market launch, under the treatment of thiazolidindions, including pioglitazon, has been reported on an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular demic.
It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but a ordnative doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular dems if patients may report on disturbances of vision; a suitable ophthalmic severance should be considered.
In a summary analysis of messages undesired events in terms of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials have been treated with more than 8,100 patients with pioglitazone for a period of up to 3.5 years.
The reckoned fracture incidence was 1,9 questionnaires per 100 patient-years treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years with women who were treated with a comparative medicine.
In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fraktures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 rates per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.
The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or that occurs, the treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).
Studies on the examination of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, Phenomenoumon and metformin.
Interactions with medicines referred to by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, Cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductasinhibitors are not expected.
Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazone by the 3 times.
The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a lowering of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.
This is due to the treatment with pioglitazone that reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for ficially growth.
Very frequent > 1 / 10; frequently > 1 / 100, < 1 / 10; rarely > 1 / 1000, < 1 / 1000; rare > 1 / 10000, < 1 / 1000; very rare < 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not invalable).
These lead to a temporary change in the turbulence and the reindexes of the lens, such as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.
In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege occurred over three times the upper limit of the norm range, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.
In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of a heavy heart failure was 1.6% higher than with placebo when Pioglitazon bzw were more than placebo.
Since the launch market has rarely been reported on heart failure in Pioglitazon, but more frequently if Pioglitazone in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure was used.
There was a summary analysis of messages undesired events in randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative surgical groups.
In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PROACTIVE study, Fraktures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.
Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day after seven days have no symptoms occurred.
Pioglitazone seems to act on activating specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferative recurring receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.
It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose consumption in the case of insulin resistance.
A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the period until leaving the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).
At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c < 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of patients (compared with 50% of patients receiving Gliclazid).
In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin exposure, to Pioglitazone or placebo were randomized.
In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the middle HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared with the patients who continue to have insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in which was treated with pioglitazone group was observed.
In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinine-quota compared to baseline values.
The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small, dated 18 weeks analysis of type 2 diabetic.
In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and marginally, but clinical not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.
In clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, total plastic glycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.
Compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels while metformin and Gliclazid was observed.
In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postponents of triglyceride levels, both with effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.
In the PROACTIVE trial, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised to receive an existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for either Pioglitazone or placebo.
After oral application, Pioglitazone is readily absorbs, with the top concentrations in fixed pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.
Based on this basis, M-IV's contribution to its effectiveness in about the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.
In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, Phenomenoumon and metformin.
The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).
After oral application of radioactive marking of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, markers was mainly found in the thread (55%) and a lower extent in the harn (45%).
The average plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and those of the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.
The plasma percentage of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, however, the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent is similar.
In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkey match the repeated appointment of Plasmaine augmentation with hematology, anaemia and reversible heart hypertrophie.
This is due to the treatment with pioglitazone that reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for ficially growth.
In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of the urinary epithelium was induced.
In a animal model of family-tempered polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions resulted in an increased frequency of colonids.

In another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with each Pioglitazone or Gliclazid.
In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinine-quota compared to baseline values.
In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postponed triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the tryglerid absorption, and also on the hepatic Tryglicense-synthesis.
Although the study was missing the objective of their primary endpoint, such a combination of the overall mortal, non-lethal coronary syndrome, stroke amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, put results near that with the intake of Pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk risks associated with the intake of pioglitazon.

In total, 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin in total, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.
In the study, the concentration of a substance (glyphylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted.
Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror that suggests that blood sugar levels were similar to as much as other human insulin.
Actraphane should not be used in patients that are possibly excessive (allergic) on human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.
In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the complete list is the list of packages).
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that the advantages of Actraphane weigh over the risks associated with diabetes.
In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S an authorization of the establishment of Actraphane in the European Union.
Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a fast initiating effect will be desired with a longer lasting effects.
Injection moulds must be used under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.
Patients whose blood glucose levels have improved considerably by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia-warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.
Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin-type (fast-phase, long-phase insulin.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin delivery) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA against insulin of animal origin) can result in that a change of dosage is required.
If switching to Actraphane in patients an Dosisadaptation is required, this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.
Some patients, at which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a shift from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin.
Prior to travel, which should go beyond several times of time, the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his physician, as such trips can lead to other times or taken to other times.
The doctor therefore has to consider potential interactions in the therapy and his patients always ask for other drugs.
4. hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-sufficient diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.
Severe hypoglycemia may lead to consciousness and / or seizures, and end with temporary or lasting disturbances of brain function and even death.
Disorders of the nervous system Gelegulation - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar levels can be associated with complaints related as acute painful reropathy and usually irreversible.
5. intensifying the insulin treatment with a rupruptive improvement of blood glucose levels, but may be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.
Diseases of skin and skin cell tissue accidental - Lipodystrophy At the injection point can be created a lipodystrophy when failed to switch the insertion within the injection range.
General conditions and complaints at the administration location in accidental treatment during insulin treatment may occur local hypersensitivity actions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection point).
Diseases of the immune system Gelegaria - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbances, angiogenic agents, low blood pressure, and fainting / fainting.
Hypoglycemia can however be progressively developed: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or glucose food.
Diabetics should therefore always have grapes, sweets, cookies, or sugar fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness are treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid person or by glucose that will be intravenously by the doctor.
The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum torque is reached within 2 to 8 hours, and the overall operation time is up to 24 hours.
Resorption The Resorption profile is justified in this, that it is a combination of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.
A range of divisions (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were moved into consideration; none of the metabolites made by the split is active.
Based on conventional studies for safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity, for carcinogenic potential and to reproductive quality, the preclinical data do not recognize a particular dangers for the human being.
It is recommended - after the Actraphane flow bottle was taken from the refrigerator - allow the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is used according to the manual for the first use.
Some patients, at which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a shift from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin.

12 The hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-sufficient diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.
13 An intensive use of insulin treatment with a rupruptible improvement of blood glucose concentrations may, however, be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.
The terminal half-time (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of adsorption than a measure of elimination of the insulin (insulin has a length of ½ of only a few minutes).
It is recommended - after the Actraphane flow bottle was taken from the refrigerator - allow the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is used according to the manual for the first use.

This document is a summary of the European Public Financial Report Report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Humanarztant (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.
The arztably effective element in Actrapid, insulin human (rDNA), is produced with the process of so-called "recombinant technology":

Actupid should not be used in patients who may be oversensitive to insulin human (DNA) or any of the other components.
In addition, the doses of Actupid might be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar.
In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S an authorization of Actrapid within the European Union.
If two types of insulin are mixed, the amount of the rapidly-effective insulin must first be reared, then the amount of insulin sought insulin.
3. if change to Actrapid for patients an Dosisadaptation is required, this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.
Prior to travel, which should go beyond several times of time, the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his physician, as such trips can lead to other times or taken to other times.
5 General disorders and complaints at the appointment of funds in local hypersensitivity interaction during insulin treatment may occur local hypersensitivity actions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection point).
Diabetics should therefore always have grapes, sweets, cookies, or sugar fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness are treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid person or by glucose that will be intravenously by the doctor.
A clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyperglycemia (blood sugar over 10 mmol / l) with 204 diabetic and 1344 non-diabetic patients who induced greater surgical procedure induced Normoglycaemia (blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 mmol / l) reduced mortality by 42% (8% vs. 4.6%).
The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum torque is reached within 1.5-3.5 hours, and the overall operation time amounts to about 7-8 hours.
Children and adolescents The pharmacokinetic profile of Actupid was studied in a smaller number (n = 18) diabetic children (aged between 6 and 12 years) and adolescents (aged between 13 and 17).
The data is limited, however, the assumption that pharmacokinetic profile is similar in children and adolescents from adults.
Infusion systems with Actrapid in concentrations 0.05% sodium chloride, 5% D-glucose and 10% D glucose with 40 mmol / l potassium chloride are used for use of infusion-bags for 24 hours at room temperature for 24 hours.
11 If due to Actrapid for patients a dose of dose is required, this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.
Prior to travel, which should go beyond several times of time, the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his physician, as such trips can lead to other times or taken to other times.
13 General disorders and complaints at the appointment of funds in local hypersensitivity interaction during insulin treatment may occur local hypersensitivity actions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection point).
Diabetics should therefore always have grapes, sweets, cookies, or sugar fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness are treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid person or by glucose that will be intravenously by the doctor.
Children and adolescents The pharmacokinetic profile of Actupid was studied in a smaller number (n = 18) diabetic children (aged between 6 and 12 years) and adolescents (aged between 13 and 17).
The intravenous application of Actupid made of fabrication or cartridges should be an exception and only occur in situations where there are no trace bottles.
If switching to Actrapid for patients an Dosiscustomization is required, this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion.

Remove the connection lid. • Desire the rubber sleeve using a medical tug • Use your injection pocket straight and firmly on Actrapid Novolet (figure A) • drag the large outer cap of the injection nadel and the inner cap of the injector pin ab.
Proceed as follows, to avoid the injection of air and to ensure proper dosage: • Keep Actupid Novolet with the injector to top • Klock you a few times with the finger easily against the cartridge.
If air bubbles are present, this makes them up in the cartridge upwards, turn the cartridge to top right in the direction of the pledge (Figure B), while the injections are still pointing upwards, press the push button into (Figure C) • Now you have to drop the drop knob into a drop of insulin injections.
• Put the cap back so far back to the finishing pen that number 0 is opposite to the dosing mark (Figure D), and check if the push button is pressed.
If the push-button is not able to move freely, insulin is pressed from the injection pin • The scale on the closing folder shows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 units.

Adenuric is applied in patients who are already able to have signs of crystallization, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or gasket notes ("stones" that can lead to larger urine crystalline, which can lead to joint and bone damage).
If the urea-acid can be increased after two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per decilite, the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day.
During the first treatment months, still sick cases can still occur; therefore, patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with adenuric nor further medicines for prevention of arthritis.
The medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplant since it was not examined for these groups.
In the first study, participating in the 1 072 patients, the efficacy of three adenuric dosages (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared to placebo (pseudozers) and Allopurinol (another drug for the treatment of hypertension).
In the second study two dosages of Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each with Allopurinol.
In both studies Allopurinol has been used in a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.
The main indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose uretharginine was at least 6 mg / dl. in the last three measurements.
In the first study 48% (126 of 262) patients who received Adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income, and 65% (175 from 269) patients who once daily have a urethuge of approximately 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements.
In comparison, this was 22% (60 of 268) of the patients suffering from Allopurinol and no of 134 patients in the case of placebo.
The most common adverse events of Adenuric (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (Nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.
In particular, in patients with heart disease, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.
The conclusion Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in the lowering of the uproginal fluid in the blood more effective than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of adverse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels.
Treatment of chronic Hyperurikemia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits (including one of the medical records known or present in present greed arthritis).
If the serum pole should still be considered for 2-4 weeks > 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), a dose increase to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily.
In patients with severe kidney function, the efficacy and security have not been fully studied (creatinene Clearance < 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).
Children and young people there are no experiences with children and adolescents, the use of Febuxeat is not recommended in this group of patients.
Organ transplant because there is no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the use of Febuxeat is not recommended in this group of patients (see Section 5.1).
Cardiovascular disease patients with ischaedical heart disease or decompensive heart failure is not recommended for the treatment with Febuxeat (see Section 4.8).
As with other harnacitive pharmaceuticals, it may occur during the treatment of treatment in an acute ginal attack, because by lowering the serumharnacid respectability in the tissue can be mobilised.
B. at maligous diseases and their treatment, Leschi Nyhan Syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases can increase so far that it comes to a diurement in urea.
Liver disease cases during clinical trials of phase 3 were observed light inoccurrences of the liver function with Febuxeat patients (3.5%).
It is therefore recommended to carry out before the start of the Febuxostattreatment and in the further course of clinical findings (see Section 5.1).
Theophylline Zwas performed no interaction studies in Febuxeat, but it is known that the XO inhibit can lead to an increase in theophylline mirror (a inhibiting of theophylline of theophylline was also reported for other XO-shirts).
In subjects, the simultaneous production of Febuxeat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the Febuxostatexposition (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).
In clinical trials the application of naproxen or other NSAR / cox-2 inhibitors were not in connection with a clinically significant increase of adverse events.
Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochloromazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be applied together with colchicin or indometacin, without a dose adaptation for Febuxeat or the other active substance is required.
In a study involving test subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x a mean 22% increase in AUC of Desipramin, a CYP2D6 substrate, which points to a possible weak-scale effect of Febuxeat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.
Antacida It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of an antacid, the magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide contains, the intake of Febuxeat (about 1 hour), and a reduction in Cmax is 32%, but no significant change of AUC causes.
Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not close to the side effects of Febuxeat to pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.
Animal experiments do not leave to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).
Patients should be careful in control of a vehicle, service-serving machines or during exercise of dangerous activities until they can be confident that ADENURIC is not affected their performance.
A numerically higher incidence of the testing of cardiovascular events reported in the overall febradiinol Group in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found, and no correlation with Febuxeat could be detected.
The risk factors in these patients were an arteriosklerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction, or a decompensated heart failure in the patient history.
Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to < 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to < 1 / 1,000), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to < 1 / 1,000) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxeat and which were reported in all Febuxeat treatment groups in total more than once reported.
Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with colchicin. * * In clinical trials have been observed no severe skin rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions.
7 open longtime extension studies in the open longtime extension studies have been treated for 1 year long, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxeat 80 mg / 120 mg.
The events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in the studies of Phase 3 (see Table 1).
The subsequent treatment events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxeat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with a period of exposure of > 1.900 patient years), according to the data.
The subsequent treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses either or with a lower frequency:
Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypesthesia, rash, rash, burst insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, ascent of potassium concentration, erectile dysfunction, ascent of the potassium concentration in the blood, decrease of the lymphocytes, decrease of the number of white blood cells.
Effectiveness of the uronic acid is the end product of the Purinmetabolic syndrome and arises as part of the reactionary hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uronic acid.
Febuxeat is a real, non-selective inhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with a Ki-value for the in vitro inhibition, which is below the nanomolar area.
Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies in phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were carried out with 1.832 patients with hyperglycemia and gout.
The primary efficacy endpoint in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly dimming diacial seal < 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were included in each study.
Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum compatinability to study at the beginning of study of > 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl.
The APEX study showed in regard to the lowering of the serum levels below 6 mg / dl (357 µl / l) (see Table 2 and Figure 1), as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).
The FACT study demonstrated statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.
Patients with serum samples (1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were examined for the analysis. * p < 0,001 versus Allopurinol, # p < 0,001 versus 80 mg
The lowering of the serene diacidiacid value at < 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor's visit in week 2 and maintain permanently via the whole treatment.
509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum samples > 1.5 and < 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.
Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney dysfunctional restriction The APEX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney failure (d. h).
With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patient.
There were no clinically significant differences regarding the percentage of serum concentration of the serum concentrations in patients, regardless of their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney dysfunctions).
Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serumharnacid concentrations of 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl..
The data collected in two years of an open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum samples showed that less than 3% of patients were required in the months of 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients (i.e. more than 97% of patients).
This was associated with a reduction of greed nozzle size, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the gasket notes per month 24.
Increased TSH- values (> 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long-term treatment with Febuxeat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open longterm extension studies (see section 4.4).
In healthy subjects, the maximum Plasmaconzentaciations (Cmax) and the area under the Plasmaconential Time-curve (AUC) of Febuxeat increased simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.
For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in AUC is observed, which is larger than the dosisproportional increase.
After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.
However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage of serum concentration (multiple doses of 80 mg).
Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (VSS / F) of Febuxeat ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.
The Plasmarotein binding of Febuxeat amounts to about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is reached over the concentration range, which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are formed predominantly through CYP1A1, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly formed by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.
After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marking Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose included in urine as an unchanged February (30%), Acylglukuronid of the active ingredient (30%), whose known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and further unknown metabolites (3%).
In addition to the excretion about the urine was also found approximately 45% of the dose in the chair as an unaltered Febuxeat (12%), Acylglukuronid of the active ingredient (1%), whose known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and further unknown metabolites (7%).
Special patients with kidney failure according to taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxeat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function.
The average total of AUC of Febuxeat increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μg / h in the group with severe kidney function.
12 liver failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh Classification B) or medium-severe (Child-Pugh classification) or medium (Child-buffer classification A) or medium-severe (Child-Pugh classification), the Cmax and AUC of Febuxeat and its metabolism is not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.
Alter There were no significant changes in regard to the AUC of Febuxeat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenese, Impairment of Fertility With male rats, was found a statistically significant increase of urea inflationors (transitional papillomas and carcinomas) only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, where 11 times of exposure when people were found.
These findings are considered as a result of a specific Purinmetabolic and Urinary tract and considered not relevant to clinical use.
It has been noted that Febuxeat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day have no effect on the fertilization and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.
In high doses, which were about 4.3- the human therapeutic exposure occurred, maternal toxicity came up with a lowering of the reduction performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats.
Teratological studies in traversal rats with expositions that were about the 4.3-fold and in traversed rabbits with expositions which totaled 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, did not take any teratogenic effects.
Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochloromazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be applied together with colchicin or indometacin, without a dose adaptation for Febuxeat or the other active substance is required.
Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with colchicin. * * In clinical trials have been observed no severe skin rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions.
21 open longtime extension studies in the open longtime extension studies have been treated for 1 year long, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxeat 80 mg / 120 mg.
The primary efficacy endpoint in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly dimming diacial seal < 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were included in each study.
The data collected in two years of an open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum samples showed that less than 3% of patients were required in the months of 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients (i.e. more than 97% of patients).
26 as amended February of February (3%), Acylglukuronid of the active ingredient (30%), whose known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and further unknown metabolites (3%).
Liver functional limitation After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh classification A) or medium-severe (Child-Pugh classification) or medium (Child-buffer classification A) or medium-severe (Child-Pugh classification), the Cmax and AUC of Febuxeat and its metabolites were not significantly reduced compared to subjects with normal liver function.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenese, Impairment of Fertility With male rats, was found a statistically significant increase of urea inflationors (transitional papillomas and carcinomas) only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, where 11 times of exposure when people were found.
The holder of approval for placing on the market has to be certain that a pharmacovigilance system is described as in version 2.0 Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, ready before the medicine is put into traffic, and so long is how the medicine is put into circulation.
An upgraded RMP is to be present to risk management systems for medical practitioners with the next periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
In addition, upgrading of the RMP is required • if new information is required, the pharmacovigilance schedule or activities to risk management are necessary, within 60 days of reaching major milestones (pharmacovigilance or risk reduction) • on the request of the EMEA
In some people, the ureuric acid can accumulate in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that urea is insoluble.
If you maintain the urea concentration by the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the crystallization will be prevented and in this way a reduction of complaints is achieved.
ADENURIC must not be taken when you are oversensitive (allergic) against the substance Febuxeat or one of the other components of ADENURIC.
Tell your doctor before you start with taking this medication, • if you have a heart failure or suffer or at any other heart problem. • if you are due to a high urea concentration in a result of cancerous disease or Lesch-nyhan-syndroms (a rare congenital disease, where too much urethic acid is found in the blood).
If you have an attack in the moment (sudden occurrence of severe pain, sensitivity sensitivity, redness, heat-feeling and articulation), wait until the toxication fall before you start with the treatment with ADENURIC.
This does not have to be with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first treatment weeks or - monate, occur if you are taking ADENURIC.
Your doctor will help you to prevent any other medicines in order to prevent a densiveness or to treat the symptoms (such as pain and articulation).
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when you use other medicines / apply or applied recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.
It is particularly important that you may take your doctor or pharmacists as you may take drugs, use the interactions with ADENURIC and your doctor may need to be superior. • Mercaptopuse (for treating asthma) • Theophylin (for treating asthma) • Warfarin (for treating asthma)
There were no studies on the effects of ADENURIC to traffic noise and the ability to serve machines.
Therefore, please take ADENURIC only after consultation with your doctor if you know, that you suffer from any tolerability to certain sugars.
On the back of the blister pack, the individual weekdays are printed, so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day. • The tablets must be swallowed and can be taken with or without food.
If you have given unintentionally an overdose, please contact your doctor or to the nearest hospital at the nearest hospital.
If you have forgotten the intake of ADENURIC you will get this faster possible, unless the next intake is before.
When you break the intake of ADENURIC, your urea-concentration can again rise again, and your complaints can be worsen, because new rock crystals are able to form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings.
Frequent side effects (more than 1 of 100 treated but less than 1 of 10 treated): • spicuous liver test values • diarrhea • headache • rash • nausea
Rare side effects (more than 1 of 10,000 treated but less than 1 of 1,000 treated): • weakness • nervousness • Durstfeel • heart palpitations
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.

ADROVANCE is used for the treatment of osteoporosis (a disease in which the bones are incubated) in women after menopause, with a risk of low vitamin D levels.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the meal, drink or use of other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).
To avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not take until after the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals, which are approved in the European Union, the company found data from previous studies and published literature.
The company also introduced a study with 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase of vitamin D spies.
After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with ADROVANCE were lower (11%) than those with whom exclusively Alendronate income (32%).
The company also indicated data that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss.
The most common adverse events (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the digestive apparatus such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipence, diarrhoea (ulcera), ulcers, dysphagia, dysphagia (blinded abs) and sour cherries.
In patients with parametric hypersensitivity (allergy) against ageing, vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied.
It may not be used in diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes.
In Yanuary 2007, the European Commission granted Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. on a approval for the approval of ADROVANCE approved in the European Union.
Cap-shaped, white till broken white tablets, marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and "710" on the other side.
ADROVANCE is only with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of drugs (including antacids, calcium and vitaminase supplements) for the day.
The following references are considered exactly to reduce the risk of ösophageal irritation and to decrease adverse events (see section 4.4):
• ADROVANCE should be swallowed after the day only with full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not swallow the tablet into the mouth as a risk of oropharyngeal Ulzera. • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day, which should take place earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical intervention in the upper gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Edema hageal reactions, such as oophagitis, ösophageal Ulzera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by ösophageal striktures, were reported in patients under taking Alendronat (partially these severe and required a hospital instruction).
The doctor should therefore refer to all signs and symptoms that are to point out on possible ösophageal irritation such as dysphagie, pain in swallowing or retrospernal pain or new or unpolluted sodburn the medicine and get medical advice (see section 4.8).
3 The risk of severe adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correct and / or it according to the onset of symptoms that indicate a ösophageal irritation.
It is very important that all dosing instructions to the patient will be passed and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
In large-scale clinical trials with alimronat no increased risk, rarely (after market launch) Magnet and Duodenalulzera, some of them are severe and associated with complications (see section 4.8).
Osteonnecrosis of a pine, usually related to a tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment options are mainly intravenous for bisphosphonate.
There are no data available, the hints indicate whether the removal of a bisphosphonattherapy in patients who need a jaw surgery that reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of pine trees.
The clinical assessment by the treated doctor is crucial for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefits of risk assessment.
Patients should be instructed to assume that they should take a tablet in the next morning after taking a dose of ADROVANCE.
They should not take two tablets on the same day, but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the planned weekday.
Other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism), should be treated with ADROVANCE before the start of therapy.
Alendronat foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the orption of alimronate when they are taken at the same time.
Therefore, patients have to wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Although specific interventions studies were not performed, alimronate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of usually prescribed drugs, without the clinical relevant interactions occurred.
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and therefore, neither during pregnancy, to apply to breastfeeding women.
Animal studies with alimronate have no indication of directly abusing effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.
Osteonekrose of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports are of cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosis.
Nevertheless, abort of calcium calciums appeared up to < 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum - phosphats up to 2,0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.
Alendronat Instead of an oral overdose can hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as magistrate, Sodburn, edesophagitis, Gastritis, or Ulzera.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin through UV light over the conversion of 7-Dehydromes to vitamin D3.
The main effect of 1.25-Dihydroxylic D3 is the increase of intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate as well as the regulation of calcium calcium, the renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.
In severe cases, a lack of secondary hyperparathyreoidism, hypophosphatemia, weakness of the proximal musculature and osteomalazie, thus lead to a further increased risk for storms and bone breakthroughs in osteoporotic individuals.
Bone mineral density) at spine or hips, which lies 2.5 standard deviations under the middle value for a normal, young population, or regardless of the bone density as a suburb pathological Fraktur.
Patients received ADROVANCE in the lower strength (70 mg / 2.800 i.e.) (n = 350) or FOSAMAX (Alendronate) 70 mg once a week (n = 332); additional vitamin D supplement were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment the average serum levels were significantly higher (26%) in the group under ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2.800 i.e.) (56 nmol / l [23 ng / ml]) than in the group under Alendronate alone (46 nmol / l [18.2 ng / ml]).
ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2.800 i.e.) sened significantly after 15 weeks of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum value of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 37.5 ng / l [< 15 ng / ml]) by 62.5% compared to Alendronate alone (12% vs.
Studies with Alendronat once a weekly 70 mg (n = 519) and Alendronat 10 mg daily (n = 370) was detected in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
The effects of alimronate on bone mass and fractures of postmenopausal women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the Fraktur intervention study (FIT: n = 6.459).
In the phase III studies, the middle distances of BMD was 10 mg / day compared to placebo in 3 years by 8.8% at the spine, 5.9% at the spine as well as 7.8% on the Trochanter.
In the group treated with Alendronate Group a reduction of 48% (Alendronat 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) suffered during the proportion of people who suffered one or more fluxes.
In the two-year extension of these studies, the BMD covers the spine and Trochanter continued to keep the BMD of the Female Tower and the entire body has been maintained.
Fit consisted of two plazecontrolled trials, with alimronate daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily) was taken either over 1 or 2 years):
In this study the daily production of alimronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrates by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
Resorption Attracts to a intravenous reference dose, the average oral bioavailability of Alendronate in women 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after persistent fasting and two hours before recording of a standardized breakfast.
The bioavailability increased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.
In osteoporosis of studies, Alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day.
In healthy subjects, the gift of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily) resulted in no clinically significant change in oral bioavailability (increase in average within 20% to 44%).
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Alendronate has distributed temporarily out of 1 mg / kg in antibacterial deposits, but then spread rapidly in the bones or excreted with the urine.
Excretion After the intravenous gift of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substance was eliminated within 72 hours with the urine and no radioactivity was found in the thread.
After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal Clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and the systemic Clearance exceeded not 200 ml / min.
Alendronate is not out of the acid or basal transport system of the kidneys, and therefore it is not accepted that humans have influenced the excretion of other medicines by these transportation systems.
Resorption in healthy adult subjects (females and men) was after the gift of ADROVANCE after persistent fasting and two hours before recording of a meal the middle area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-120 h) for vitamin D3 296,4 ng / h / ml (without taking advantage of endogenous vitamin D3).
The average maximum concentration in serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5,9 ng / ml and median time until reaching the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) 12 hours.
Biotoplasty vitamin D3 is rapidly inhibited to 25-hydroxylic D3 hydroxyxylic acid and then in the kidney to 1.25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form, metabolic.
Separation of radioactive markedly increased vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers was the average excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4%, in the thread after 4 days 4.9%.
Characteristics of patients with clinical studies have shown that the proportion of alimronate, which is not deposited in the bone, excreted through the urine.
Although no clinical data are above, however, it is necessary to calculate that the renal elimination of alendronate as in the animal tests also in patients with reduced kidney function will also be reduced.
Therefore patients with reduced kidney function can be expected to increase slightly higher cumulation of alimronate in the bone (see section 4.2).
Alendronat non-clinical data based on conventional studies on security harmacology, for chronic toxicity, to the genotoxicity and the kanal potential let no particular dangers for the human being.
Studies in rats showed that the gift of Alendronate was due to pregnant rats with the occurrence of Dystokie in the womb that was due to a hypocalcemia.

Patients received ADROVANCE in the lower strength (70 mg / 2.800 i.e.) (n = 350) or FOSAMAX (Alendronate) 70 mg once a week (n = 332); additional vitamin D supplement were prohibited.
Vitamin D3 (the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE) once per week was shown in a 24-week renewal study with 619 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
After 24-week treatment, the average serum levels of 25-hydroxylic D were significantly higher in the 5.600-I.T. group (69 nmol / l [27,6 ng / ml]) than in the 2.800-I.E.-vitamin D3-group (64 nmol / l [25,5 ng / ml]).
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups with hypercalciurie at the end of the 24-week extension.
At a rate of 70 mg, 3.1% of the group had a week of 10 mg, respectively, or 10 mg. daily.
In this study the daily production of alimronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrates by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).
The bioavailability increased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronat one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.
Distribution studies in rats revealed that Alendronate is distributed temporarily out of 5 mg / kg in antibacterial properties, but then distributed quickly into bones or excreted with the urine.
Resource absorption in healthy adult subjects (women and men), according to the gift of ADROVANCE (70 mg / 5.600, i.e.) after persistent fasting and two hours before recording of a meal the middle area below the serum concentration time curve (AUC0-80 h) for vitamin D3 490.2 ng / h / ml (without taking advantage of endogenous vitamin D3).
The average maximum concentration in serum (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng / ml and median time until reaching the maximum serum concentration (Tmax) 10.6 hours.

Adjacke is administered adults with whom a kidneys or liver was transplanted in order to prevent transplantation of transplanted organ by the immune system.
Since Tacrolius and Prograf / Prograft is already used in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft and data from published literature.
Furthermore, the results of a clinical study of 668 patients with kidney transplant were presented, with the use of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.
The main indicators of the efficacy was the number of patients who had been cancelled after a treatment duration of a year (by example, as often a renewed organ transplant or a recovery of dialysis was needed).
In addition, shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and investigated how Advaginal raf is absorbed in the comparison to prograf / programming of the body.
Tremor (tremor), headache, nausea / vomiting, diarrhea (diarrhoea), kidney problems, increased blood sugar level (hyperglycemia), diabetes, increased potassium content of blood (hypercalemia), hypertension (hypercalemia) and insomnia (Insomnie).
In patients with some hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macro-lid (such as erythromycin) or any of the other components may not be applied.
Patients and doctors need to be careful if others (especially some herbal) medicine be taken at the same time with Advaginas, since the Nobleraf dose or the dose of the same drug may be adapted accordingly.
Hard capsules, retarded yellow-orange gelatine capsules, printed in red ink on the light yellow Cape Verde with "0.5 mg" and on the orange cap with "# 647"; they contain white powder.
Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive Therapy and the treatment of transplants, this medication should take place or changes in the immunosuppressive therapy.
Due to clinically relevant differences of Systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant pressure or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.
Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; settings of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the engmaschigen control of one in the transplant medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
In a consequence of an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.
The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of defense and tolerability in the individual and blood level regulations (see below "recommendations"
After transition from Prograf on Advaginas, the Tacrolimus-Talers should be controlled before the transition and over two weeks after conversion.
On Day 4, Systemic exposure, measured as valley mirror, was comparable to kidney disease both in kidney-and-transplanted patients.
Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus-tales are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advaginal raf, to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate recovery phase.
Because Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas can take several days until the Steady State is reached.
If the patient is not allowed to use drugs in the first postoperative period, the tacrolus treatment intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an infusion solution) can be initiated with a dose of ca.
Duration of application for the suppression of transplantation must be maintained in immunosuppression; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified.
Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplant genetic disorders should start with 0,20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.
Further dose-izations can be later necessary, because the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus may change in the course of stabilisation in the patients after the transplantation.
Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant genetic disorders should start with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.
Dosage recommendation - changeover from prograf to Advagraf must have a graft receiver twice daily intake of prographraf. thus, this changeover in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) has related to the whole daily dose to take place.
Kidney and liver transplant After a change of other immunosuppressants on Advaginal raf once daily the treatment with each patient must begin in kidney and liver transplant recommended oral dose for prophylaxis of graft survival.
Heart transplant At adult patients who are inverted on Advagraf, an oral initiation of 0.15 mg / kg / day will take place once a day.
Other transplant caters, although there are no clinical experience with Advaginas at lung cancer, armory transplanted patients in an oral initiation of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, in a oral initiation of 0.10 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplant recipients in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day for use.
Dosiscustomizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood supply mirror in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.
Patients with reduced kidney function The kidney function had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose of dose is not required.
Due to the nephrotic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum levels) is recommended, a calculation of the creatinine and monitoring of the urinary volume).
Conversion of Ciclosporin on Advaginas At the transition from a cicrid porin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is required (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Recommendations to the Talbot in full blood. the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of shocking and tolerability in individual use of solid blood-tactic tackling-levels.
It is recommended to carry frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during the maintenance therapy.
Blood-tales of Tacrolimus should also be tested according to transition from programlimus, Dosiscustomization, changes of immunosuppressive Therapy, or simultaneous application of substances that could change the tacrolimus blood concentration (see section 4.5).
Since Advaginal raf is a drug with a low Clearance, the dose of dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.
The data in clinical trials include that a successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the levels are not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.
In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplants usually occur in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and in transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.
During the subsequent detection therapy of liver, kidney, and cardiac transplant, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.
This has led to serious adverse events, including graft statements, or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.
Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; settings of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the engmaschigen control of one in the transplant medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
5 For treatment of adult patients with graft absorption, proved to be proved by other immunosuppressants as a refractory regiment, there are still no clinical data for retardized formulation.
Prophylaxis of graft patients with adult transplant receivers and graft receivers in child-age are not yet clinical data for retardized formulation Advaginal raf.
Due to possible interactions which may lead to a reduction of the Tacroclimate change in the blood and a weaker of the clinical effects of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), is to avoid any other plant effects during a treatment with Advaginas (see section 4.5).
In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered because the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.
In rare cases, under programyopathy was referred to as cardiomyopathy, chamber or sepia hypertrophie, which is therefore possible also under Advagraf.
Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid load and oils.
As with other immunosuppressants, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.
If patients who are taking the Tacrolimus, symptoms for Pres such as headaches, changed consciousness levels, seizures and vision, should be a radical investigation (e.g.
Since Advaginas satisfy hard capsules, retardized, lactose, patients with a rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-gactose malabsorption is prescribed.
The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as Hemmer or Inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus reduce blood values of Tacrolimus.
Therefore, the tackling blood levels in the same gift can change the CYP3A metabolism, to monitor and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain the same concentration (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
A strongly pronounced interaction was used with antimycotics like ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and foresazole, as well as with the Macroid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV-protein inhibitors (z.
Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly attributable to the elevated oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus due to the inhibiting of gastrointestinal metabolism.
Highly dosed Prednisolon or methylprednisolon how it is used in acute breakdown reactions, increase the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.
Impact of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tactlimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be treated with CYP3A4 due to their metabolism.
Because Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contrabiceps and thus raise the hormonal exposition, which is particularly careful in decisions concerning the receptive measures.
The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazone and can extend their half-value.
The results of a small number of transplants transplants provide no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of unwanted events regarding the course and the result of pregnancy.
In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborns recommends the harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).
It consists of the risk of premature birth (< week 37) and a hypercalemia of the newborns (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:
The secondary profile of immunosuppressants often can be found because of the oderous disease of patients and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.
In the following, the side effects after their frequency in descending order is very common (≥ 1 / 10, ≤ 1 / 10), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, less known (frequency based on the available data cannot be invalable).
Ischemic disorders of the coronary vessels, tachycarat chamber arrhythmia, heart failure, myocardiopathy, chamber hypertrophie, supraventricular arrhythmia, palpitations, anomalies in the ECG, abnormal heart rate and pulse rate
Diarrhea, nausea Gastrointestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal disease, stomatitis and ulceration, aszites, vomiting, pain in the gastrointestinal tract and Abdomen, flatulence, flatulence and pulmonary, loose chair, signs and symptoms in gastrointestinal tract.
Infection and parasitic diseases How known to other high-effective immunosuppressants is treated in patients who are treated with tacrolimus which are often increased to infection (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoale).
Cases of BK Virus associated Nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukocyencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppressant therapy, including therapy with Advaginas.
It was reported on benign or malignant Neoplasty including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the Tacrolimus treatment.
Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high ties of erythrocytes and plasma proteins can be assumed that tacrolius is not dialyzed.
Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects on molecular level should be the effects of tacrolimus through its commitment to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enrichment of the cell within the cell.
This leads to calcalcium dependent inhibition of signal transfer due to T cells and prevents the transcription of a certain series of lymphodgkin genes.
Tacrolimus oppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and g-interferon) as well as the expression of the leukin-2 receptor.
In the first 24 weeks in the Adjacke group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the programme group (N = 234) 29.3%.
Patients survival rates after 12 months were at 89.2% for programming; in the Admission arm 25 (14 women, 11 men) and in the programme arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) deaths.
Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of advaginal sex and Prograf was, each in combination with Mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, compared with 667 de novo kidney transport receivers.
Patients survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for adults and 97.5% for Prograf; in the Admission arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the programme arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) deaths.
The effectiveness and safety of programming, Ciclosporin and Advaginal raf, each in combination with Basiliximab-antibody-antibody, MMF and corticosteroids, compared with 638 de novo kidney transport receivers.
Incidence of therapy after 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy confirmed acute loss or missing follow-up data) amounted to 14.0% in the Advaginal group (N = 214), 15.1% in the programme group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Cicrid group (N = 212).
The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf- Cicrid porin) (95.2% concurrent interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Adolraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (programming language interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for programming vs Ciclosporin.
In the Adjacke arm 3 (men), in the program arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Cicrid arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) deaths.
Published results of primary immunosuppression with Tacrolimus in the form of twice daily from other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognised primary immunosuppressant after pancreas, pneumonia and intestinal transplantations.
In 1775 patients, at 475 patients who undergone a pancreatic transplant, and 630 cases were used as a primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.
In total, the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies showed the observations in the major studies where programming in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients were used to primary immunosuppression.
Lung transplant in a intermediate analysis of a recently performed, multi-center study with oral programming has been reported in 110 patients that received either tacrolimus or cicrid porin.
Even a chronic transplant absorption, the bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).
The survival rate after one year amounted to 80,8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Cicrid group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).
Patients treated with the Tacrolimus patients in 21.7% of cases were obliterated to the emergence of a bronchiolitis in comparison to 38.0% below Cicrid porin (p = 0.025).
The number of cases where Ciclosus had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0.02) as the number of patients who were released by Tacrolimus (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).
The number of cases where there was no acute transplant in which there was 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%), in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).
In a study the frequency of the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterative syndroms were significantly lower with the Tacrolimus patients.
Pancreas A multi-center study with oral programming was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously received pankreas- and kidney transplantation, which received a randomized process Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Cicrid porin (n = 102).
The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently given to reaching the rebate levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5.
Intestinal transplant The published clinical results of a monoCentric study with oral programming as primary immunosuppression showed in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivisceral transplantations) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an upligible survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.
Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone mariner, lower initial doses of tacrolimus which lead to valley mirror between 10 and 15 ng / ml and the newly developed transplant radiation (Abu al-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).
Factors such as low hematocrite level, and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound group of Tacrolimus, or caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the metabolism of the metabolism of the transplantation.
This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic before the excretion, with the excretion mainly via the bile.
In stable patients that were included from prograf (once daily) at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advaginal raf was nearly 10% lower than under programming.
It is recommended to carry frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during the maintenance therapy.
21 For treatment of adult patients with graft absorption, proved to be proved by other immunosuppressants as a refractory regiment, there are still no clinical data for retardized formulation.
Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid load and oils.
In the first 24 weeks in the Adjacke group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the programme group (N = 234) 29.3%.

In total 34 patients from Ciclosine were inverted to Tacrolimus, while only 6 Tacrolimus patients had used another therapy (Bechstein et al., Transplantation 2004; 77: 1221).
Intestinal transplant The published clinical results of a monoCentric study with oral programming as primary immunosuppression showed in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivisceral transplantations) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an upligible survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.

Advances to the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one caused by lack of factor VIII related, congenital blood flow disorder) is used.
Dosage and frequency of the application judge, whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or the prevention of bleeding within surgical procedure.
Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clots problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method produced as "recombinant DNA technology":
It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) brought it to the formation of the human being factor VIII.
Advate is another product approved in the European Union called rebinate, but it is different, so the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.
In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedure.
In the main study, the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood seams were awarded "excellent" or "good."
The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.
Advances must not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) against human clotting factor VIII, mouse, or hamster protein, or any of the other components.
In March 2004, the European Commission informed the Company Baxter AG for the approval of Advantages in the European Union.
Dosage Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy, according to the severity of the factor VIII-Mangels, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical state of the patient.
In the following horrhagic events the factor VIII activity shall not fall under the specified plasma level (in% of the norm or in i.e. i.e. / dl).
Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute influence are removed.
Injection is repeated every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of patients is over.
During the treatment course it is used to control the dose and frequency of injections a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma concentration.
Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, varying in vivo recovery and feature different half times.
3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40, of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.
If the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose, a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibitor.
In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out.
The appointment speed should be addressed after the patient's desire, where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
These inhibitors are always quantified against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.
The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk within the first 20 extrusion stage is the largest and of genetic and other factors.
In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition and common inhibitory development was observed after conversion of a recombinant factor VIII product to another that is observed (humility) inhibitors.
Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
In the largest number of patients ADRs were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), which were all in previously untreated patients who have higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).
Very common (≥ 1 / 10 to < 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to < 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to < 1 / 1,000), very rare (1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invalable).
A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). b) The unexpected waste of blood clots factor VIII in postoperatively (10 - 14 post-operative day) in one patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.
The blood clots was maintained during the whole period and both the factor VIII- Spiegel in plasma and Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post-operative day.
In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 expositions showed a low inhibitory (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).
In addition, the 53 pädiatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavier to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was found after prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.
In previously untreated clinical trial, 5 of 25 (20%) treated patients with ADVATE patients treated inhibitors to factor VIII.
The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.
One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicate an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.
In four patients, the occurrence of Urtikaria, Pruritus, rash and increased number eosinophies granulocytes were reported in several repeated product texts within the study.
7. as with other intravenous products, ADVATE has been reported on hypersensitivity reactions of allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoider reactions (frequency unannounced).
The activated factor VIII works as a factor for the activating factor IX, and accelerates the formation of activated factor X of factor X.
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A (factor value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).
Pharmacokinetic parameters come from a cross-over study with ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or > 10 years and are listed below table 3.
Table 3 summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters of ADVATE in 100 patients with severe and moderate hemophilia A (factor VIII < 2%) PK parameters (Pharmacokinetics)

Therefore, CHMP has decided on the basis of safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.
In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP), that the company takes its application for the approval of Advent by Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.
Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue, which combines other structures in the body, is surrounded and relies).
This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that a gene can carry into the body's cells.
The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself, and therefore no infection can trigger in man.
Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.
The p53 protein produced by the non-defect in the human body existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells, if the DNA cannot be restored.
With Li-Women's cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working correctly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.
The company put data from a study of a study involving the Li-Women's cancer in the field of substructure, in the bones and the brain.
After the CHMP had examined the answers to the questions posed by the company, some questions were still unexplained.
Based on the assessment of the initial documents, the CHMP generates a list of questions that will be sent to the company.
The CHMP's view was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of advent in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits benefits for patients.
The committee further concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the form of administration and the security of the drug.
In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment, nor for people who come in contact with the patient, that is harmful.
The company did not deal with the CHMP whether the consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.
"modified active ingredients," means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released over a few hours.
Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal grinous nose (clogged nose).
For adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water or without food.
The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).
A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be recreated on constipation of the nose.
The main measures were the changes of the severity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.
During the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.
When considering all the hay fever symptoms except the blockage of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze income, above a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.
If only the swelling of the nose has been considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in patients receiving Desloratadin alone.
The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarate (cardiac inability), pharyngitis (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, Insomnie (sleeplessness), Somnolency (drowsiness), sleep disorders, and nervousness.
Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are perhaps excessive (allergic) against Desloratadine, Pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenerous active ingredients or Loratadine (another medicine for allergies) are not used.
Aerinaze can also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (high blood pressure), hyperthyrosis (hyperhypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperfunction of thyroid) or have a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted an authorization of aerating Aerinaze in the European Union.
The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, if whole is to swallow (i.e. without them to bite, to break or cut).
Aerinaze should not be used due to the failure of data for uncertainty and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) not for children under 12 years of age.
The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after defending the symptoms.
It is recommended to limit the application time for 10 days, since during long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take time.
After declining the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, treatment with Desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapy.
Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or in the 2 weeks after the termination of such a therapy.
This is due to alphamimetical activity in combination of pseudoephedrine with other vasocontin, Pergoeyelid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymeterolin, naphazolin, etc.).
Safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient-collective, and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage.
Safety and effectiveness of aeropaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage.
Patients must be informed that treatment with occurrence of hypertension or tachometer or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a reinforcement of the headache) must be removed.
For the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with heart rhythmias • Patients with heart rhythmia • Patients with a myocardial infarction of patients with myocardial infarction in the history, diabetes mellitus, blisters of brass or bronchospasmus in history.
Aerinaze has at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, as antihistamines may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent.
In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, in case of erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, there were no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin.
In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences between the patients were detected, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin who was still not identified, so the interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.
Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate or inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.
The unquestionability of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.
Since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to human beings, and because of the vasoconstrictor characteristics of Pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.
However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases there may be a drowsiness that can lead to an impairment of traffic management or the ability to serve machines.
Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collars) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.
Headache, anxiety, anxiety, muscle tensions, muscle weakness, tantinsufficiency, heart rhythmists, tachration, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, Tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotension.
A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atrophin typical symptoms (mouth dries, pupillenrigid and - dilatation, skin erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).
These include both the hibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human fat cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesion's P-selection on endothelial cells.
In a single dose-study of adults, Desloratadine 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement variables, including the amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with flying.
In controlled clinical trials, at recommended dose of 5 mg, increased frequency of drowsiness was diagnosed compared to placebo.
The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause more likable anomalitic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachometer or manifestation of a CNS arousal.
1,248 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.
In both studies the histamine antagonist effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined based on the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal grrenal swelling), significantly higher than a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.
The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in relation to the deviating effect, determined based on the nasal grind, was significantly higher than a monotherapy with desloratadine above the 2-week treatment period.
The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.
In the context of a single dose-study to the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.
After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine reached 10 days.
In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosisstudy conducted with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four test subjects Desloratadine was badly changed.
A components study study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure to an Aerinaze Tablette.
Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, for toxicity in repeatability, to genotoxicity and Reproductive Toxicity, however, clinical data with desloratadine do not recognize any special dangers for the human being.
The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.
In reproductive treatment studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was in the oral surgery in rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogen.
March 2007 and Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation for authorisation for the application of the pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.
Antihistamines contribute to the alleviating of allergic symptoms by considering that histamine has its own substance, its effect can develop.
Aerinaze tablets lenses symptoms that appear in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or juckling nose, or juckling eyes with simultaneous constipation of nose.
20 Under certain circumstances, you can be particularly sensitive to the mucuous drug Pseudoephedrine, which is contained in this product.
(diabetes), a stensizing gastric ulcer (ulcer, which leads to a tightening of stomach upside or the oesophagus (intestinal clasp), a blister clasp, bronchospels in the patient history (shortness of lung musculature), a prostate increase or problems with liver, kidneys or bladder.
Tell your doctor if using Aerinaze's use in the following symptoms or disorders occur or diagnosed: • hypertension, heart hunting, heart palpitations, nausea and headache, or a amplification of existing headaches.
When taking Aerinaze with other drugs. please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs.
Traffic noise and the loading of machines At use in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aerinaze leads to drowsiness or descending attention.
If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze, you should immediately get your doctor or pharmacists when you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.
If you have forgotten the intake of Aerinaze If you forgot to take a dose in time, get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose to the planned date.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.
Heart hunting, restlessness with increased physical activity, mouth dries, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, drowsiness, headache, sleep disturbances, nervousness, and drowsiness.
Heart palpitations or cardiac arrhythmists, increased physical activity, skin irritation, stomach pain, nose pains, nose pains, stomach pain, stomach pain, sincerity, stomach pain, shivers, contamination of the smell, unobtrusive liver values, agitation, anxiety and irritability.
After the launch of Desloratadine, very rare about cases of serious allergic reactions (breathing, whipping breathing, itching, swelling and swelling) or skin attacks are reported.
Over cases of palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia with increased physical activity, over cases of liver infection and about cases of showy liver values, was also very rare reported.
It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- and 5 mg. processed tablets (pill, which dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion.
For children in the age of one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which in the form of 2.5 ml sirup bzw.
For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml sirup bzw.
Aerial was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adult and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).
The effectiveness was measured by the variation of symptoms (itching, number and size of addling, compromised sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks treatment was determined.
There were further studies presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children unimaginable.
In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius on average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) of 25 to 32%, compared to decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.
In both studies on Urtikaria, the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% treated with placebo treated patients.
Aerius may not be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against Desloratadine, Loratadine or any of the other components.
In January 2001, the European Commission informed the Company SP Europe an authorization of the establishment of Aerius in the European Union.
One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).
There are limited experience from clinical trials regarding the application of Desloratadine in adolescents 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the existing disease and can be resumed after defending the symptoms and when restorations are resumed.
The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended for the patient during the allergies.
Clinically relevant interactions were detected in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets, with erythromycin or ketoconazole (see Section 5.1).
In a clinical-pharmacological study, using Aerius and alcohol have not been reinforced with the higher effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).
However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases there may be drowsiness that can lead to an impairment of persistence or ability to serve machines.
Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.
The most common adverse events reported on the more common than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth-dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).
A clinical study involving 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse effects, which were treated at 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadine and were treated with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.
In a multi-dose study at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.
This includes both the hibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human fat cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesosecüls P-selection on endothelial cells.
In the context of a clinical study of multiple outlets, in the desloratadine a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.
In a clinical-pharmacological study in which Desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the Nunfold of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.
In a single dosing study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg. showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including the amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with flying.
In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving the symptoms such as nioeses, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrivation and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.
In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persiating allergic rhinitis.
Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.
Persizing allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.
As a result of the total scores of the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigating more forms of the Urtikaria, as the underlying pathophysiology has been similar to etiology at different forms and chronic patients can be simpler and simpler.
Since the histamine is a scientific factor in all urticular diseases is expected that Desloratadine is expected to improve the symptoms of Urtikaria in other forms of Urtica; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidance.
In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in improving pruritus and lowering the amount of amount and amount of torches at the end of the first dose.
As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.
Improvement of a reduction of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.
The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.
In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable in patients with generic seasonal rhinitis had been comparable, 4% of patients had higher concentration of Desloratadin.
There are no connection points for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.
However, this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin who was still not identified, so the interactions with other medicines will not be excluded.
Desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate or inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.
In a single dosing study with Desloratadine in a dosing of 7.5 mg taken meals (fetch, calorie-rich breakfast) not to availability of Desloratadin.
The clinical studies conducted with Desloratadine and Loratadin who showed comparative degrees of exposure of Desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadine and Loratadin.
Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity and Reproductive Toxicity, pre-clinical data with desloratadin may recognize no special dangers for the human being.
Color film (includes Lactose Monohydrat, hymeccable, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, indigocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (contains hymless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.
Aerial may be taken independently of meals, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).
The recommended doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data are required to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.
In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies you should play a role in diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests.
About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic Desloratadine is reduced and experienced a higher substrate load (see Section 5.2).
The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are limited to metabolic, is identical to the children that are metabolic.
This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption, or insufficiency of this drug may not be taken.
Clinically relevant interactions were not found within the clinical studies of Aerius tablets, with erythromycin or ketoconazole (see Section 5.1).
In a clinical-pharmacological study, using Aerius tablets and alcohol have not been reinforced with the higher effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).
Overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerial Sirup group similar to the placebo group.
Clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.
In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.
Children aged between 1 and 11, who came to question for an antihistamine therapy, received a daily desloratopsis of 1,25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged 6 to 11 years).
Because of the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin may be extrapolated in adults to the children population.
In the context of a clinical study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine, in a dose of up to 20 mg. daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.
In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadine in a dosing dose of 45 mg daily (the Nunfold of clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval.
In controlled clinical trials, at recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness was diagnosed compared to placebo.
In an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no impairment of psychomotor.
In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, it was not given to the simultaneous taking of alcohol not to an amplification of alcohol-induced damage to increase the drowsiness.
In adult and young patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviation of symptoms such as nioeses, nose secretion and itching of nose, itching, lacrients and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.
As shown on the basis of the total scores of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets decreased effectively through seasonal allergic rhinitis.
In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in improving pruritus and lowering the amount of amount and amount of torches at the end of the first dose.
The spread of this restrictive phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasian (2% adults, 3% children).
Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup forms of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are limited to metabolic disorders.
The load (AUC) by Desloratadine was about 6x higher after 3 to 6 hours, and the Cmax about 3 to 4times higher with an additional half-value of approximately 120 hours.
There are no connection points for clinically relevant active substance Kumulation after a daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.
12 In various single dose studies showed that AUC- and Cmax values of Desloratadin in pädiatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadine syrup in a dose of 5 mg.
However, this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin who was still not identified, so the interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.
Aerius syrup is offered in type III plastic bottles with 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 150, 225 and 300 ml.
Equipped with a rigid, transparent polystyrene measuring scoop, calibrated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml, or with a application injection for preparations for insertion capacity of 2.5 ml and 5 ml (only for the 150 ml bottle).
A dose of Aerius Lyophilisat once daily place in the mouth to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).

Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in addition to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see Section 5.1).
Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius tablets as in patients who were treated with placebo.
In a multi-dose study, used up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.
In two single dose studies, Aerius Lyophilisat was well tolerated; this was documented by clinical laboratory results, medical examinations, vitalmarks and ECG intervals.
In the context of a clinical study with multi-outlets, in the desloratadine, in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was applied for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.
In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the Desloratadine in a dosing dose of 45 mg daily (the Nunfold of clinical dose) was applied for ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.
In controlled clinical trials, at recommended dose of 5 mg, increased frequency of drowsiness was diagnosed compared to placebo.
In a 17 single dose study of adults, Desloratadine 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement variables, including the amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with flying.
In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving the symptoms such as nioeses, nose secretion and itching of nose, itching, lacrivation and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.

Desloratadin among children between 2 and 11 years, which are limited to metabolic, is identical to the children that are metabolic.
This drug contains sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorptionshematic or sucroase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
The overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Desloratadin group similar to the placebo group.
In infants between 6 and 23 months, the most common adverse events were reported on the more common than in placebo (3.7%), fever (2,3%) and insomnia (2,3%).
An additional study was observed in an additional study of 2.5 mg desloratadine to donate any side-effects in patients between 6 and 11 years.
In the recommended doses, the plasma orations of Desloratadin (see section 5.2) were comparable in the children's adults and adulthood.
In controlled clinical trials, at recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness was diagnosed compared to placebo.
In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and
As a result of the total scores of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets decreased effectively due to seasonal allergic rhinitis.
The spread of this restrictive phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasian (2% adults, 3% children).
Since Aerial's solution contains the same concentration on Desloratadine, no bioequivalent study was required and it is expected that they correspond to the syrup and the tablets.
In various single dose studies showed that AUC- and Cmax values of Desloratadin in pädiatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadine syrup in a dose of 5 mg.

In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. of the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) officially announced that the company takes its application for the insurgent of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.
Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.
This is a special kind of accine that might cause a tribe of influenza, which might cause the future pandemic to protect.
A influenza pandemic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus, which can easily spread from man to human, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.
After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the components of the influenza virus (flu virus) as "physically" and forms antibodies against it.
As a result, the immune system will be able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus to this tribe.
The membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, recognises the human body as body-foreign), cleansed, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.
An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).
As a result, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine does not comply with the requirements of the guidelines on the EMEA for pre-Panamanian vaccines.
Should you participate in clinical examination and require further information regarding your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.
If you want more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).
It is used in combination with other antiviral medication for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
For patients who can't swallow the capsules, Ageneral is available as a solution to insert, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.
Agenera should then be prescribed then if the doctor has tested the antiviral medication of the patient previously, and the likelihood has been judged that the virus will appeal to the medicine.
The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Konavir and with other antiviral medication.
In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agregase increases after body weight.
Agenerated is reduced in combination with other antiviral medication the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS, but can cause damage to the immune system, and so that the development of AIDS is related to HIV infections and disease.
Agenerated was studied in combination with other antiviral medication, but without any rite avir, studied in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with protagonists.
The agitation with low-controlled chionavir increased medicinal product was used in 206 adult, which had previously taken protagonists, compared with other protagonists.
Major indicators for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not demonstrable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.
In the studies involving patients who had previously taken no proteasinhibitor had had more patients a virusload of 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Agenerated was less effective than indinavir.
In children, Agenera also reduced the virusload, but of the children who were treated earlier with proteasgiants, were very few to the treatment.
In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasgiants, this was the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protagonists:
In patients with HIV, which was resistant against four other protagonists, there came under Agenera together with Ritonavir, a stronger waste of the virusload after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous proteasinhibitor:
The most common side effects of Agenerated (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).
2 / 3 Amonase should not be used in patients that are possibly excessive (allergic) against Ambabode or any of the other components.
Agenerated is not allowed to be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are declassified as genera and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of harmful health.
As with other medicines for HIV consists of patients who are taking the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoneksis (abdie of bone tissue) or an immunal activation (symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system).
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerated in combination with other antiretroviral medication used in combination with other antiretroviral medication treated HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years over against the risks.
Agenerated is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amponavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of Agenerated in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no proteasinhibitor is not demonstrated.
AGenerasy was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances, since the approval of scientific reasons only limited information.
In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited granted approval for the placing of agitation in the European Union.
Agenerated is in combination with other antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children aged 4 years onwards.
Usually, Agenerated capsules are to be used for pharmacokinetic boopadding of Ambaboo with low doses of Knights (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
The use of Ambaboavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the patient's pre-treatment (see Section 5.1).
The bioavailability of Ambaboo as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution can not be replaceable at a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).
The recommended dose for agitation capsules is 600 mg of Ambaboo twice daily with 100 mg of Kavibaboo twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.
2 If Ageneral capsules are used without the amplifying addition of rite avir (padding), higher doses to be used to be used (1200 mg twice daily).
The recommended dose for agitation capsules is 20 mg of Ambavavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambaboo that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).
Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agregase in combination with low doses of chionavir or other protagonists were not examined in children.
Generase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to the failure of data for uncertainty and effectiveness (see section 5.2).
Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Ageneric capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day, and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions increased to 300 mg twice daily.
The simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Ageneral may not be given simultaneously with medicines containing a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).
Vegetable preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma centrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ambaboo during the taking of Ambaboo (see section 4.5).
Patients should be pointed out that Agenerated or any other antiretroviral therapy is not leading to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.
The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenera does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.
Usually, Agenerated capsules are to be applied together with low doses of chionavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see section 4.2).
Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from a antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver coexistence with potentially fatal course.
For the case of congenital antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of this medicine.
Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic hepatitis-active hepatitis showed a higher frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.
The simultaneous application of Ageneral and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Glukokorticoids, which will be confused about CYP3A4, is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the annex function (see section 4.5).
Because the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is highly recommended by Ageneric platinum with Lovastatin and simplatin because of the increased risk of myrrien including Rhabdomyolysen.
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening adverse events such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of international normalities), are available methods to determine the drug concentration.
In patients who use this medicine simultaneously, Agenera can be less effective for reduced plasma cutting of ammonavir (see section 4.5).
Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ambavir can be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contrasts, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.
If methadone is given at the same time with Ambavavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium traffic symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of knights.
Because of the possible risk of a toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerated solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be treated with caution by certain other patient groups.
Agenerated should be set to 5, if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).
In patients who received antiretroviral therapy, including proteasinhibitors, has been reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.
Many of the patients had other diseases associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.
B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders, associated.
In hemophilia patients (Type A and B), which have been treated with protein inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematoms and hemmarthroes.
At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an antiretroviral therapy (ART) may develop an anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual-opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.
Although a multifactorial transaction is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneksis were reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).
CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude should not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).
CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width of agroar must not be coupled with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma cutting with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.
It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.
In an attempt to compensate the lower plasma protein by dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects observed in the liver.
St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambaboo can be humiliated by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).
If one patient is already taking St. John's wort, Ambavirradial levels and, if possible, examine the virusload and add the St John's wort.
Dosisadjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given along with Ambaboo (see also Eebirenz below).
508% increase, for Cmax, by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambabode capsules (600 mg twice daily).
In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambaboo had been prescribed twice daily and Konavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and inconsistency of this treatment device.
52% lower when Ambaboo (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).
The Cmin value of Ambaboo in plasma, which were achieved in combination of Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Kbaboo twice daily), when Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kavibaboo twice daily.
A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambaboo and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it will be recommended a close surveillance, as the effectiveness and unquestionability of this combination is not known.
There was no pharmacokinetic study used in combination with didanosin combination with didanosin, however, due to the antacidic component of didanosin, however, that the proceeds from Didano in and agitation are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).
Therefore, during the gift of Efavirenz in combination with Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose of dose is required.
The treatment with Emotirenz in combination with Ambaboo and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protests would be low.
The effect of Nevirapine on other protests and existing data suggests that Nevirapine may be sunk the serum concentration of Ambaboo possibly sunk.
If this medication should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced and potentially subtherapeutic plasma concentration.
If this medicine be used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological supervision is to be done as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambaboo and Ritonavir is difficult.
The simultaneous production of Ambaboo and Rifabutin has led to a rise in the plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin in order to increase the side effects associated with Rifabutin.
If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is prescribed along with agregase, at least half of the recommended dose is advised, although no clinical data will be submitted.
Pharmacokinetic studies with agregase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but may be increased the plasma cutting of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration.
The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma at 25% and AUC (0%) compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.
Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, can be used together with agregase, possibly to interaction.
The patients should therefore be toxic to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with genera.
Based on the data of other protagonists, it is advisable that Antacids will not be taken at the same time as Agenera, because it can come to resorption disorders.
The simultaneous application of anti-convulva, known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with ammonavir can lead to a dissemination of the plasma cutting of Ambaboo.
Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, dipine pin, nibpin, nibpin, nibpin, nibpin, nidipine, nidipine, nibpin and diapamil can be increased by Ambaboo, thereby the activity and toxicity of this drug may be increased.
Simultaneous taking with agitation can increase their plasma percentage points considerably and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).
In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol rose by about 86% (90% concurrent intervals 82 to 89%).
Consequently, the simultaneous gift of agregase with kavibaboo is not recommended along with these Glukokorrhoids, unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).
HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4 are pronounced in the plasma concentration of the same administration.
Since Plasmaspiration increases the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a rhubarb olysis, the combined application of this medication is not recommended using Ambaboo.
It is recommended a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of mirrors, as the plasma orations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and tacrolimus may be increased with the same gift of Ambaboo (see section 4.4).
Therefore, Agenera must not be used together with oral-recorded Midazolam (see section 4.3), while using the current application of Agenerated with parenteral midazolam caution.
Data for simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteashibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma torrent of Midazolam to 3-4 times.
If methadone is administered along with Ambaboo, patients should therefore be monitored on opium traffic symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Knights.
Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is no recommendation to adapt like the Ambavir- dose when Ambavavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.
At the same gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulties together with Agenerated is an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) because of the possibility of a weaker or amplification of the antithrombic effect (see section 4.4).
The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contradiction is not predictable, so alternative methods are recommended for contraception.
Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and nortryptilin) is recommended for the same gift of agitation (see section 4.4).
During pregnancy, this medication may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus compared to the pregnancy.
In the milk lakeshed rats, Ambaboo-related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambavavir affects people into breast milk.
A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was given up to the end of the breastplate in the uterus to the end of the lactation of Ambaboo, showed an decreased increase in 12 body weight.
The further development of income, including Fertility and reproductive ability was not impaired by the administration of Ambaboo.
In adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medication were examined.
Most of the side effects associated with the Ageneral treatment were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely led to treatment failure.
Many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with taking Agenera or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or if they are a result of the admiry disease.
Most of the adverse events are taken from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protein inhibitors were not previously treated 1,200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.
Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were weighted by the investigators as well as in connection with the study mediation, and in more than 1% of patients have occurred, as well as the treatment of laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.
The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) with HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fawn fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie of breasts and sovious fat accumulation (stalks).
At 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons treated with Ambaboo in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudin over a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case (spikes) was observed (< 1%).
In the PROAB 3006 study included 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Ambaboo 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs above a median duration of 56 weeks (p < 0,001).
Skin rash were usually slightly until moderately pronounced, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with Ambaboo had to be broken.
Cases of osteonekrose were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).
At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual-opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).
In patients treated with PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerated twice daily together with low-dose chavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients who received Agenera with low-borne pavir, very frequently occurring.
In case of transitions, the patient is observed at signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) when necessary, necessary support measures.
Ambaboo binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins steps with the consequence of a formation, non-infectious viral particles.
The antiviral activity of Ambaboo in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in akut and chronically infected lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as to peripheral blood lymphocytes.
The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) from Ambaboo lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm with infected cells and is 0.41 µm with chronic infected cells.
The connection between the activity of Ambaboo against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.
In the treatment of antiretroviral non-previously treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other rite cavities with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations only rarely observed.
In sixteen years of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who have received 700mg of Fosamprenavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure to be studied until week 48 where 14 isolates were genotypically investigated.
A genotypical analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure had previously appeared within the 59, showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults.

In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamplifavir / 100 mg of Kamponavir twice a day: n = 107), patients with virological predictions were associated with virological failure about 96 weeks, the following Proteasinhibitor mutations:
Based on genotypic resistance testing analysis, Genotypical Interpretation Systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambaboo / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein inhibitor isolates.
The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / kavir, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, I62V, V82A / C / G / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phonic resistance to Fosampleavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).
The conclusions concerning relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to additional data, and it is advised to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyze results of resistance tests.
Based on phylotypic resistance tests, analysis, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypical data on the estimate of activity of Ambaboo / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein inhibitor isolates.
Companies, distributing diagnostic tests tests, have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.
Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ambaboo associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross-resistant against kavibaboo, the sensitivity to the dinavir, Nelchavir and Saquinavir, but generally preserved.
There are currently data to cross-resistance between Ambaboo and other protagonists for all 4 Fosampy Resistors, either alone or in combination with other mutations.
On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients, with amidavavir / kavir (one of 25 isolates), inavir / kavir (one of 25 isolates), inavir / kavir (three of 24 isolates), seed avir / kavir / kavir / kavir / kavir / kavir / kavir (four of 24 isolates).
Vice versa, Ambaboo retains its activity against some other protagonists inhibitor isolates; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.
Early demolition of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can influence the following treatment.
The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerated in combination with kavibaboo 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, together with PI (100 mg twice daily), and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosing rite cavir. "
One hundred sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneral, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.
The primary analysis presented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time adjusted average variable from the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subleeve of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.
The proof of the efficacy of unbundled Agenerated is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.
In the studies, Agenerated solution was used to take and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.
There was no low dosiated rite at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.
After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients in the study included plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration < 10,000 copies / ml and 9% < 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.
19 Based on these data should be considered with the treatment optimisation of the expected benefits of "unbundled" Agenerase. "
After oral administration, the middle duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambaboo is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.
508% increase, for Cmax is lowered by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily).
The administration of Ambaboo with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambaboo 12 hours after dosage (C12).
Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous exposure of the resource absorption is affected.
The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg) and can be mounted to a large distribution volume, as well as a monstrous penetration of Ambaboo in the tissues.
This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Ambavavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.
While the absolute concentration of unbound Ambavavir remains constant, the percentage of free active changes during the dosing interval during the steaming concentration in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.
It is therefore necessary to adable the CYP3A4 or solve a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with carts (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).
The gift of Agenerated capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.
Ambaboo is made from the solution 14% less bioavailability than the capsules; therefore, Agenerated solution and Agenerated capsules are not interchangeable at a milligrammar basis.
Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the impact of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Ambaboo and Ritonavir.
These treatment options lead to Ambaboo plasmodial comparable to those who are blown to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambaboo twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.
In long-term studies for the carcinogenicity with ambavavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benigne hepatocellular adenoma at dosages, which addressed the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1,200 mg of Ambaboo.
The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma was not fully resolved and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear.
However, from the present exposition data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic use, however, yielded little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.
In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse therapy tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphoma test, microkernel test on rats and chromosome aberration to human peripheral lymphocytes was Ambaboo neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.
These liver toxicity can be detected and detected in clinical everyday life through the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.
Previously, clinical trials have been observed no significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerated, nor after the end of treatment.
Studies for toxicity in young animals, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate of animals as well as with Ambavavir animals.
In a systemic Plasmaexposition, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thyroelongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.
24 If Agenerated capsules are used without the amplifying addition of rite avir (boopadding), higher doses to be used to be used (1200 mg twice daily).
The recommended dose for agitation capsules is 20 mg of Ambavavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambaboo that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).
The simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver problems with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening adverse events such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of international normalities), are available methods to determine the drug concentration.
Agenerated should be set to 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).
Increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders.
It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.
508% increase, for Cmax, by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambabode capsules (600 mg twice daily).
The Cmin value of Ambaboo in plasma, which were achieved in combination of Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Kbaboo twice daily), when Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kavibaboo twice daily.
A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambaboo and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it will be recommended a close surveillance, as the effectiveness and unquestionability of this combination is not known.
The treatment with Emotirenz in combination with Ambaboo and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protests would be low.
If this medicine be used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological supervision is to be done as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambaboo and Ritonavir is difficult.
If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is passed together with Ageneral, the dose of rifabutin is advised to at least half the recommended dose of 31 although no clinical data will be submitted.
Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, dipine pin, nibpin, nibpin, nibpin, nibpin, nidipine, nibpin and diapamil can be increased by Ambaboo, thereby the activity and toxicity of this drug may be increased.
In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol rose by about 86% (90% concurrent intervals 82 to 89%).
At the same gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulties together with Agenerated is an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) because of the possibility of a weaker or amplification of the antithrombic effect (see section 4.4).
The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of Ethinylestradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin of Ambaboo by 22% or about 22%.
During pregnancy, this medication may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.
A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was given out of nibulation in the uterus to the end of the lactation of Ambaboo, showed an decreased increase in body weight during negligence.
In adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medication were examined.
In case of transitions, the patient is observed at signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) when necessary, necessary support measures.
The antiviral activity of Ambaboo in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in akut and chronically infected lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.
The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) from Ambaboo lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm with infected cells and is 0.41 µm with chronic infected cells (1 µm = 0.50 µg / ml).
Vice versa, Ambaboo retains its activity against some other protagonists inhibitor isolates; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.
Based on these data, treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pretreated children who are expected to be expected.
While the absolute concentration of unbound Ambavavir remains constant, the percentage of free active changes during the dosing interval during the steaming concentration in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.
It is therefore necessary to adable the CYP3A4 or solve a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with carts (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).
Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible; therefore, the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Ambaboo and Ritonavir.
In long-term studies for the carcinogenicity with ambavavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benigne hepatocellular adenoma at dosages, which spoke to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) exposure to people daily from 1,200 mg of Ambaboo.
The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatozelular Adenomas and Karcinome was not yet confirmed and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear.
However, from the present exposition data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic use, however, had little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.
In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse therapy tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphoma test, microkernel test on rats and chromosome aberration to human peripheral lymphocytes was Ambaboo neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.
Studies for toxicity in young animals, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate of animals as well as with Ambavavir animals.
These results indicate that the metabolism of the metabolism are not fully equipped, so Ambaboo or other critical components of the formulation (z).
In combination with other antiretroviral medication used in combination with other antiretroviral medication used for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children aged 4 years onwards.
The benefit of a "" "" boosterling "" "" spooking solution "" "" was not used with PI pretreated patients with PI pretreated patients. "" "
The bioavailability of Ambaboo as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution can not be replaceable at a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).
The patients should, as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules, using the solution to intervene (see section 4.4).
The recommended dose for agitation solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Ambavir / kg of body weight three times daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of Ambaboo that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).
Additionally, since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous application of agregase solution for insertion and low-dose chavir can be avoided that combination with these patient groups can be avoided.
Although an Dosisance for Ambaboo is not needed for amidavbr, an application of Agenerated solution is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).
Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycol content is Agenerated solution for inducing infants and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.
Simultaneous administration can lead to a petitive inhibiting of this drug and possibly cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects, such as arrhythmias (z).
Patients should be pointed out that Agenerated or any other antiretroviral therapy is not leading to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.
The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenera does not prevent the risk of 47 of an transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.
For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening adverse events such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of international normalities), are available methods to determine the drug concentration.
Agenerated should be set on Duration if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).
Increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age, and with drug-49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders.
In hemophilia patients (Type A and B), which have been treated with protein inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematoms and hemmarthroes.
It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.
508% increase, for Cmax, by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambabode capsules (600 mg twice daily).
Simultaneous taking with agregase, their plasma percentage can increase considerably and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).
On the basis of the data to 54 other CYP3A4 inhibitors, Midazolam was significantly higher than an oral surgery in Midazolam.
The potential risk for people is not well-known. Agenerated solution for insertion may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fetus (see section 4.3).
In the milk lakeshed rats, Ambaboo-related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambavavir affects people into breast milk.
A reproduction study on pregnant rats, which was given up to the end of the breastplate in the uterus to the end of the lactation of Ambaboo, showed an decreased increase in 55 body weight.
In adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medication were examined.
Many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with taking Agenera or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or if they are a result of the admiry disease.
In the treatment of antiretroviral non-previously treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other rite cavities with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations only rarely observed.
Early 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can influence the following treatment.
62 Based on these data should be considered with the treatment optimisation in the children of the expected benefits of "unbundled" Agenerase. "
The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large Vetropy belt and an unildered penetration of Ambaboo from the blood circulation into the tissues.
The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma was not fully resolved and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear.
In a systemic Plasmaexposition, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thyroelongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.

The applicability and duration of the treatment with aldara depend on treating the treatment with aldara up to a maximum of 16 weeks per week. • In case of small basal cell carcinoma, it is up to a week for six weeks, during one or two four-week treatment cycles, with four weeks pause between the treatment cycles, three times a week.
The cream is to be diluted before bedtime on the affected skin surfaces, so that they remain sufficient (about eight hours) on the skin before it is washed away.
In all studies, Aldara was compared to placebo (same cream, but without the active substance). • Aldara was tested in four main studies of 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks.
Major indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete elimination of care. • Aldara was also studied at 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies where the patients were treated six weeks or placebo either daily or five times weekly.
Major indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete separation of tumors after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with actinic keratosis.
In all studies, Aldara was more effective than the placebo. • In all four basic studies, 15% to 52% treated with patients treated with Aldara were treated. • The results of both studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a total reduction ratio of 66% to 80% associated with Aldara patients compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.
The most common adverse events of Aldara (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are reactions to the application site of the cream (pain or itching).
Clinically typical, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic keratosis (AKs) on the face or on the scalp in an immunotherapeutic adult, if the size or the number of lesions are limiting and / or the acceptance of a cryotherapy and other topical treatment options contraindicated or less suitable.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday before bedtime and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin.
The treatment with Imiquimiodine is so long to continue until all visible threads in the genital or perianal area disappeared, or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period.
A break in the treatment described above should be woging if intensive local inflammation occur (see section 4.4) or if there is an infection in the treatment area.
If in follow up after 4 to 8 weeks after the second course of treatment the lesions were only incomplete, a different therapy should be started (see section 4.4).
If a dose is omitted, the patient should carry out the cream as soon as he noticed / her, and then continue with the usual treatment plan.
Imiquimod-cream is applied in a thin layer and drifting in a thin layer with feigns infected skin area until the cream is completely covered.
It should be weakened in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with Imiquimiodine and with a possible deterioration of their autoimmune disease risk.
It should be carried out in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with Imiquimiodine and with a possible organ bumps or Graft-vs-host- reaction.
In other studies, in which no daily pre-authauthorization was carried out, two cases of severe Phimosis and a case with a circumcision are observed.
In a application of Imiquimod-cream in higher than the recommended doses, an elevated risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases were also observed severe local skin irritation that require a treatment necessary and / or to a temporary physical impairment.
In cases where such reactions appeared at the outcome of the urethra, some women had difficulty in the water, which necessitate an accident catheterisation and a treatment of the affected area.
In connection to the application of Imiquimod-creme immediately following a treatment with other cutaneous use of applicated funds for the treatment of external threads in the genital and perianal area, there are no clinical experiences yet.
Limited data indicates an increased rate of incline reductions on HIV-positive patients, Imiquimod-cream has shown in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of feigns, however, lower effectiveness.
The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips, or the hairdressing kit was not examined.
Local front actions are common, but the intensity of these reactions take place in general during the therapy or reactions to the treatment with Imiquimod-cream.
If it is necessary due to the symptoms of the patient or because of the severity of local service actions, a treatment break may be made of several days.
The clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after the repositioning of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment.
Since currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available, with superfizial basal cell carcinomas, other suitable treatments should be moved into consideration.
In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, clinical experiences are not recommended, so the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumors.
Data from an open clinical study indicate that at large tumors (> 7.25 cm2) a lower probability of the response to the Imiquimod therapy.
Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of acute keratosis on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip-area inside the lipstick.
There are only very limited data about the application of Imiquimiodine for the treatment of acute keratoses in anatomic places outside the face and the scalp.
The available data on the actinent keratosis in arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore a such application is not recommended.
Local front actions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after setting the therapy with Imiquimod-cream.
If the local skin reaction to the patient may cause great discomfort or very strong, the treatment can be exposed to a few days.
Data from an open clinical study assumes that patients with more than 8 acts - a lesser complete healing rate referred to as patients with less than 8 lesions.
Because of the immune stimulating properties, Imiquimod can be used with caution for patients who receive an immunosuppressant treatment (see 4.4).
In animal studies, no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fredale development, the removal or postnatal development (see 5.3).
Although neither after even after one-time topical application quantifiable serum levels (> 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.
The most frequently included and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream in relation to adverse events in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the place of the treatment of feigns (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimine patients).
The most frequently reported and considered probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream in the context-standing side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.
The study of 185 with Imiquimod-creme fraaliom patients from a placebo-controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below.
The most common, considered probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-creme in the context of these studies were a reaction at the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimine patients).
The side effects that were listed by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies in phase III with Imiquimod-creme treated patients with acute keratosis are listed below.
According to test plan, evaluation of clinical signs indicate that in this placebo-controlled clinical trials with three-week treatment with Imiquimod-cream frequently came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), extroriation / exhaust (23%) and oils (14%) (see section 4.4).
This according to the assessment of the clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times a weekly treatment with Imiquimod-cream frequently came to severe erythema (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and severe damage and reduction (19%).
In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratosis Alopezie was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment location or in the surrounding area.
The insignificant one-off intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgias and fever.
The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of > 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.
In a pharmacokinetic examination following the topical application of Imiquimod, the concentrations of the alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected.
In 3 approvals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete excitation of the feign treatment in an Imiquimine treatment is far superior to placebo-treatment.
In a total of 60% of the total of 119 patients with Imiquimod treated patients suffering from the flow of fat; this was with 20% of the 105 treated patients with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):
A complete press release could be achieved in 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared with 5% of 161 treated male patients (95% CI):
The effectiveness of Imiquimod in five times per week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfizial basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.
The data from an open, uncontrolled study after four years of present data show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated clinically and this remained for 48 months.
The effectiveness of Imiquimod near three times a week in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.
Patients had clinically typical, visible, discreet, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic lesions within an related 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.
The results from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrent rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.
The approved indicator outwarts, actinent keratosis and superfizielles basal cell carcinoma occur in paediatric patients generally not up and were therefore not examined.
Aldara Cream was investigated in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimiodn = 576, placebo n = 313).
In these studies, the efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).
A minimum systematic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.
The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totaling 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application of the face (25 mg, 1 bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bag) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bag).
The calculated half-time period was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.
The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimiodine was low in patients at the age of 6 - 12 years, and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute keratpants or superfixed basal cell carcinoma.
In a four-month study of paint toxicity in rat-rat, cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Milz-weight; a study performed for four months in the mouse that had no similar effects in the mouse.
A two-year trial for carcinogenicity in mice during three days per week induced no tumors at the application site.
The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod is only one low systemic absorption from the human skin and does not mutate, is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure as very low.
The tumors appeared in the mice group treated with the effective free cream, previously used in a larger number than in the control group with less UC.
It can damage other people as well, even if these same symptoms have hurt you like you. − When one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not listed in this manual information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.
● blob (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitalia (genital organs) and the anus (after), a superficial, slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.
When it remains untreated, it may lead to disorders, particularly in the face - hence, is an early recognition and - treatment important.
Aktinic Keratosis are rough areas of the skin, which occur in humans, which were exposed to much of solar radiation during their previous life.
Aldara should only be used in flat actinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor decided that Aldara is for you the most suitable treatment.
Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body, the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinent keratosis or the infection with the appropriate responsible virus.
O If you already used Aldara cream or any other similar preparations before you begin using the treatment. o informing your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o informing Aldara cream only if the treatment area after a previous medioccured or operative treatment abcured. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips and nasal mucosa.
If you do not wash the cream through rinse with water, do not put the cream as your doctor prescribing your doctor. o. if you do not care cream as your doctor prescribe you with a bandage or patches. o Falls reactions to the treated place which gives you strong discomfort, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.
Once the reactions are deducted, you can continue the treatment. o informing your doctor if they have no normal blood image
If these daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, with increased occurrence of skin irritation swelling, fertilizers, skin, or difficulties can be calculated from the foreskin.
Apply Aldara cream not in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), the cerebrox (uterine) or inside the anus (after).
Taking other drugs serious problems with your immune system, you should not use this medicine for no more than one treatment cycle.
If you have sexual intercourse during infection with feigns in the genital heart, treatment with Aldara cream is to carry out the sexual intercourse (not before).
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when you use other medicines or recently used, even if it is not prescription drugs.
Breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream not, since it is not known whether Imiquimiodine is overcoming into breast milk.
The frequency and duration of the treatment are different at feet, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis. (see specific instructions for each application area).
Apply a thin layer of aldara cream on the clean, dry skin place with the inclines and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely covered.
Men using feign under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area below (see section 2) What do you need to consider before the application of Aldara cream? ").
Please speak to your doctor or pharmacists when you feel the impression of Aldara too strong or too weak.
A sufficient amount of Aldara cream has spent 6 weeks each week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.
Very common side effects (with more than 1 of 10 patients expected) common side effects (less than 1 of 10 patients to expect) severe side effects (less than 1 of 1000 patients) very rare side effects (less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected)
Tell your doctor / your doctor or your pharmacist / your pharmacist immediately if you don't feel comfortable during the application of Aldara cream.
If your skin is strongly responding to treatment with Aldara cream, you should not continue using the cream, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacists.
A low number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infection; it can affect you faster a blue fleck or can cause dejection.
Tell your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.
In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas where you applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).
Mostly, it is a lighter skin reaction, which will sound from approximately 2 weeks after adjusting the treatment.
Occasionally some patients have observed changes at the application location (wound, inflammation, swelling, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.
Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes at the application location (blood, inflammation, fainting, fainting, deflecous nose, flu or flu), inflammation, irritation, swelling of the eyelids, redness, facial skin, ulcers, pain, weakness, weakness or chills.
Aldurazyme is used to treat patients with secured diagnosis of a mudysaccharitin I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).
This means that certain substances (glyceraminoglyphs) are not dismantled in most organs in the body and to damage them.
The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can appear: enlarged liver, stiff joints that make movements difficult, reduced pulmonary volume, heart and eye diseases.
Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.
The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or a clinic with revitalising appliances, and patients will require appropriate drugs to prevent allergic reaction.

In the study mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, it was also measured its effectiveness (with regard to reducing the concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).
In children under five years, Aldurazyme reduced the concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study.
The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), pain pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.
Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.
Aldurazyme may not react sensitively to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not to be applied.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is updated every year all new information that may be known, check and update this summary.
The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who keep Aldurazyme concerning reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.
In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval for the Company Genzyme Europe B.V. offering authorization of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.
Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammals (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).
Aldurazyme is indicative of the long-term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mudysaccharitin I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).
Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.
The initial index rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient is wearing it, increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.
The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme for adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.
Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.
With Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion reactions that are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).
For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be supervised, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment where revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.
Due to the clinical phase 3 study, virtually all patients IgG antibodies are to form against laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment commence.
Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).
As little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break-up, due to the theoretical risk provisions, a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautious after a disruption of treatment.
60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyherka) to minimize the potential occurrence infusion reactions.
In case of a light or medium-infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.
In the case of a single, severe infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused by means of antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen.
Infusion is used to reduce the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.
3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.
Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.
Animal experiments do not allow to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Since there were no data on newborns which were exposed to Laronidase on breast milk, is recommended to breastfeeding during treatment with Aldurazyme.
Clinical trials in clinical trials were mainly used as infusion reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).
Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme that were observed during the phase 3 study and an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently listed in the following chart: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to < 1 / 10).
In some patients with severe MPS I-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in the history there were also severe reactions, including bronchospasmus, breaths and facial oils (see section 4.4).
Children unwanted pharmaceuticals in connection with Aldurazyme that were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe failure and treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.
100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.
Most patients occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment with a server version, with a severe failure rate mostly within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).
Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or until an early retirement from the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients without a radioimmune response (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients, with which it had never been at the server version.
Patients with lack of low-antibody levels referred to a robust reduction in the gag mirror, while in patients with high antibodies, a variable reduction of Gag in the harn was observed.
Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutral-level effect on the enzymatic physical activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in the harn.
The presence of antibodies seemed unwanted in connection with the incidence of undesired drug transactions, even if the occurrence of undesired drug reaction typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.
The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrats and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymes.
After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymphoosomes, the most likely above Manni-6 phosphat- receptors.
Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients (age 6 to 43).
Although patients were recruited for the study identified the whole disease spectrum, the majority of patients had the mean phenotype and only one patient found the severe phenotype.
Patients were recruited as they were recruited by less than 80% of the expected value (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value; and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 metres.
The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute line in the 6-minute walk test.
All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where it received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.
After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients with improved lung function and the inability to be shown in the following table.
The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.
The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.
Of the 26 patients with a hystanders before treatment amounted to 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.
Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of gag levels in the Harn (µg / mg creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.
Regarding the heterogeneous disease, between the patients who were combined with the use of a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes in patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%), had no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).
A year-old phase 2 study was performed in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years (16 patients with severe decline in form and 4 in middle course form).
In four patients the dose of increased GAG- mirrors was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.
In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) determined according to the Z Score for this age group (< 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with middle course form indicate a normal mental development speed, while in the older patients with severe failure form just limited or no progress in cognitive development.
In a phase 4 study tests on pharmacoyme dosing scheme from various aldurazyme dosing scheme on the gag mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test were carried out.
100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.
The Dosiderschema with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may have patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion. however, it is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing scheme is equivalent.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will assess any new information that will be available, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug may be updated.
The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients.
Based on conventional studies for safety spmacology, toxicity in unique gift, toxicity in repeatability and reproduction, the pre-clinical data do not recognize a special dangers for the human being.
Since no tolerability studies were performed, this drug may not be mixed with other drugs, except those listed below 6.6th.
If the ready-ready-ready preparation is not immediately used, this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, unless the dilution under controlled and validated aseptic conditions were carried out.
5 ml concentrate on the production of a solution in a side bottle (Typical I-glass) with stoppers (silicone-chlorbutyl rubber) and sealing (aluminum) with topping cap (polypropylene).
10 Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Je after body weight of the individual patients initially determine the number of diluent turnable bottles.
Within the given time, the proprietor of the approval for the placing of the study has given the following programme programme to form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit risk relationship.
This register will be treated in longer term security and efficacy-related information that have been treated with Aldurazyme as well as data to the natural progence of the disease in patients without this treatment.
In patients who suffer from MPS I is an enzyme called α -L-Iduronidase, which splits certain substances in the body (glycosaminoglyphs), either in low quantity before or this enzyme is missing completely.
If you are allergic (sensitive) to one of the components of Aldurazyme or if you have an severe allergic reaction to Laronidase.
An infusion reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4 "Which side effects are possible").
In use of Aldurazyme with other drugs. please inform your doctor if you are using medicines that contain chloroquin or Procain because a possible risk of a diminished effect of Aldurazyme exists.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken any other medicines or recently taken, including non-prescription drugs.
Hints for handling - dilution and application The concentrate on the use of an infusion solution must be diluted before the application and is provided for the intravenous application (see information for physicians and medical specialists).
Initial Infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient is wears that, every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.
In some patients with severe MPS iso-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in previous history, however, serious reactions occurred, including bronchospasmus, respiratory, and facial oils.
Very frequent (occurrence of more than 1 of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash or joint pain, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • drowning pulse • Hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the infusion unit
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will provide any new information available, rate per year, and if necessary, the packing unit will be updated.
If the ready-ready-ready preparation is not immediately used, this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, unless the dilution under controlled and validated aseptic conditions were carried out.
Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Je after body weight of the individual patients initially determine the number of diluent turnable bottles.
Alimta is used along with Cisplatin (other medicines for cancer) if the cancer is not reproducible "(malignant cancer) and" maligne "(malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic" non-small cell lung cancer, which does not grasp the squamous cells.
Alimta is used in patients who were not treated before, in combination with Cisplatin and in patients who previously had already received other chemotherapies that have previously applied to several therapy.
To reduce side effects, patients with Alimta should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and receive injections of vitamin B12.
If Alimta is administered along with Cisplatin, before or after the gift of Cisplatin, an "antiemeal medicine" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency).
In patients whose blood image changes, or any other side effects occur, treatment should be set up, set down or reduced the dose.
Thus, the active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.
The conversion of Pemetrexed in its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.
For the treatment of maligning Pleuramesotheloma Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease.
Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer were the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug versus cancer).
Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (other medicines for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.
Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cisplatin.
In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival compared with Alimta 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months in docetaxel.
In both studies, patients in which cancer were not attack epithelial cells, when Alimta caused longer survival compared to the comparative medicine.
In September 2004, the European Commission approved the Company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. offering authorization of Alimta in the entire European Union.
Each side bottle has to be saved with 4,2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml.
The corresponding volume of the necessary dosshism is taken from the bottle, and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).
ALIMTA is displayed in combination with Cisplatin, in combination with cisplatin, in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).
ALIMTA in Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma except for outstanding drive epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).
The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle.
The recommended dose of Cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of Pemetrexate infusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle.
In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF was administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment course.
To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the Pemetreboxed gift and the day after the treatment a corticosteroid is given.
During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetreboxed, at least 5 doses have to be folic acid, and the intake must be continued during the period of therapy and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.
Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third beam cycle.
In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created prior to each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombozygotic count.
The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to the upper limit.
At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose of dose must be held by the nodrs of blood balance or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predige- hending treatment cycles.
According to the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which apply to ALIMTA as a monotherapy or combination with cisplatin.
These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 blood.
Should patients develop non-adhesological toxicity of 3 (except neotoxicity), the therapy should be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient remains the value before treatment
Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be broken when in patients after 2 dosing products, an haemological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity is 3 or 4 or 4 or 4 neurotoxicity.
Clinical trials have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over, in comparison to patients aged 65 years, an increase of adverse events.
ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to unsufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness.
In clinical trials, patients with a creatinine-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need dose adjustments needed to go beyond for all patients recommended Dosisizations.
Data in patients with a creatinine-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).
However, patients with a liver failure of > the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- boundary value and / or transaminase values of > the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or > 5.0 times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) are not specifically studied in studies.
Patients must be monitored in relation to the Knoefmarketers and must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophelper has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte result has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.
A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutropencode, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).
A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and nithological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was recommended if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.
Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetre-treated patients must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophyllactic measure on reducing toxicity (see section 4.2).
Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (creatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous taking of non-steroid antiphlogic (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindful of 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).
All patients who are intended for treatment with Pemetrexed is required to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-term therapy for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).
Many patients where these events occur, appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.
Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid collection in the transcellular space, there should be a drainage of the effusion in front of the Pemetrexed treatment.
5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving Pemetrexed occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.
For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenued live vaccine (excluding yellowfever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).
Since the possibility of an irreversible damage of reproductive ability exists through Pemetreboxed, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginn insisted to obtain advice on sperm.
In patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroid antiphlogiska (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) resulted in a reduced pemetre-separation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.
Therefore caution applies if patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) contains high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.
Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindful of 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).
Since there are no data regarding the actionary potential as piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.
The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulties and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of INR (International standardization ratio) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anticoagulation.
There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed during pregnancy, but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected during an application during pregnancy severe birth defects.
Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful cleaning of the farm for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).
Since the possibility of an irreversible damage of reproductive ability exists through Pemetreboxed, men should be pointed out before the treatment start, advice on the spermaconservie- lockout.
It is not known whether Pemetrexed to breast milk and unwanted effects when embroidered acid can not be excluded.
The following table shows the frequency and severity adverse effects that were reported in > 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized Cisplatin as a monotherapy.
Side effects: very common (≥ 1 / 10 and < 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 and < 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 and < 1 / 1,000), very rare (< 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on the available data from spontaneity reports not invalable).

Clinically relevant CTC toxicity related to < 1% (occasionally) of patients were randomized Pemetrexed, included supraventricular arrhythmias.
The clinically relevant laboratory toxicity of 3 and 4 was similar to the results of three different Pemetrexed monotherapies (n = 164) of phase 2, except neutropenie (12.8% compared with 5.3%) and an increase in alanintransaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).
These differences are probably returned to differences in the patient population, since the Pha- se 2 studies have both chemically-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal output values of the liver function tests.

Clinically relevant toxicity related to ≥ 1% and ≤ 5% (frequently) patients were randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, included:
Clinically relevant toxicity related to < 1% (occasionally) of the patients were reported that were endowed to Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, included:
Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascultic occupations and transitory attacks were administered in clini- studies with pemetreboxed, which is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance, occasionally reported.
Clinical trials have been reported in patients with Pemetrexed treatment cases of Coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perfoal, intestinal Neksis and Typhlitis).
Clinical trials involving Pemetrexed treatment were occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratorily insufficiency.
There was reported cases of acute kidney failure in Pemetrexed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.4).
Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were irradiated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).
ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antiquat that interrupts its effect by interrupting the logical metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.
In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed is interfered with several Attack points, by blocking the thymidylatrease (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folliant key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.
EMPHACIS, a multicentine, randomized, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA and Cisplatin treated patients with malignant Pleuramesotheliom, that with ALIMTA and Cisplatin treated patients with clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients who were only polluted with Cisplatin.
The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received testing medicine in the treatment arms (randomized and treated).
A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoe) in connection with the maligning Pleuramesotheliom in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the sole Cispla- tin-arm (218 patients).
The differences between the two treatment arms were obtained through a improvement of lung function parameters in ALIMTA / Cisplatin-arm and a deterioration of lung function in the time of the control arm.
A multicenter, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA to docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy, with ALIMTA patients (Intent to Treat Population n = 283) and of 7.9 months treated with docetaxel treated patients (ITT n = 288).
An analysis of the influence of the histology to the treatment effect on the overall survival of ALIMTA patients with NSCLC; 95% CI = 0,61-1,00, p = 0.047), used in patients with squamous cell histology (n = 172, 6.2% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018).
Limited data from a separately randomised, controlled phase 3 study shows that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for pemetre-mixed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) are similar to docetaxel.
The efficacy analysis of the PQ population are consistent with the analyses of ITT population and support non-superiority of ALIMTA Cisplatin combination versus gemcitabine Cisplatin combination.
Mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of gemcitabine Cisplatin (adjusted HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.94 - 1,15) for the combination ALIMTA Cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI = 25.0 - 31,4) for the combination of gemcitabine Cisplatin.
Analysis of the influence of NSCLC histology on survival showed clinically relevant sub-differences according to histology, see table below.
CI = Intent interval; ITT = Intent-to-Treat; N = Size of the total population a statistically Significant for non-perplexity, with an overall concurrent interval for HR (= Hazard ratio) clearly under the non-sublection limit of 1,17645 (p < 0,001).
Patients who were treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin, required fewer transactions (16.4% versus 22.3%, p < 0,001), erythrocytes transport (1.8% versus 4.5%, p = 0.002).
Also patients (10.4% versus 18.1%, p < 0,001), G-CSF / GM-CSF (3.1% versus 6.1%, p = 0.004), and iron preparations (4.3% versus 7.0%, p = 0.021).
The pharmacokinetic features of Pemetrexed according to the gift of monotherapeutics were examined at 426 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg / m ² in infusion sites across a period of 10 minutes.
Pemetrexed is eliminated mainly in the urine and 70% to 90% of the prescribed dose are refound within 24 hours after the use of the urine.
Pemetrexed has a total of 91.8 ml / min and the semi-precious time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney cancer (creatinine-Clearance 90 ml / min).
In a study involving beagle dogs that had received intravenous Bolus injections for 9 months, testicular changes were observed (Degree ration / necrosis of seminiferous epithelial cells).
Unless otherwise applied, the storage times and conditions after the preparation of the application and conditions should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C, unless otherwise, the preparation / dilution has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Solve the contents of 100 mg / ml sodium sprayer (9 mg / ml) without preservative added, resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml Pemetrexed.
The resulting solution is clear and the coloring is enough of colourless to yellow or greenish yellow, without compromising the product quality.
Each side bottle has to be saved with 20 ml 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml.
23 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving Pemetrexed occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.

In the week prior to use of ALIMTA and approximately every 9 weeks (according to 3 cycles of the treatment with ALIMTA) you will also receive an injection of vi- tamin B12 (1000 mcg).
In this use formation a side effect is described as "very common" this means that it was reported from at least 1 of 10 patients.
If a minor effect is described as "frequently" this means that it reports from at least 1 out of 100 patients, but reported less than 1 of 10 patients.
If a minor effect is described as "occasionally", this indicates that they were reported of at least 1 of 1000 but less than 1 of 100 patients - de.If a minor effect described as "rarely" means that it was reported from at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients.
Fever or infection (often): if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above, sweating or other signs of infection (because you may have less white blood cells than normal, which is very common).
If you feel tired or weak, look quickly in shortness of breath or blossom (because you may have less hemoglobin as normal, which is very common).

The resulting solution is clear and the coloring is enough of colourless to yellow or greenish, without compromising the reduction quality.
It is used for overweight adults with a body massage index (Body Mass Index - BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in connection with a low-calorie, fat-produced diet.
Patients who take alli can take no weight loss after 12 weeks, should apply to their doctor or pharmacists.
If these enzymes are inhibited, they can't dismantle some fats in the food, thereby resulting in the food for about a quarter of the fats.
In a third study, alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.
In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who have 60 mg. a year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.
In the study with alli patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, patients could not be observed for the patient's relevant weight loss.
The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) oily spots on after, fliatus (winds) with bowel movements, chair rang, fetal / oily chair, finish oils (torches), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.
It must not be used in patients who are treated with ciculporin (to prevent transplanting patients) or with drugs such as warfarin for preventing blood clots.
It may not be used in patients who are absorbed in a long-term malabsorption syndrome (with which non-sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract) or to Cholestase (liver disease) suffer from pregnant or pregnant mothers.
In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited granted approval for the establishment of orlistat GSK in the European Union.
Alli is indexed for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) indexes and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypotheorical, fatty fish produced diet.
Alli must not be applied among children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety.
Since orlistat is minimally readily absorbs, elderly and / or kidney function is not necessary for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.
• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Detection of pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Equal treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulation (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)
The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase when alli is taken together with a low-fat burning meal or low-fat diet.
Since weight reduction in diabetes with an improved metabolic control could be, patients who should consult a drug against diabetes before the start of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist, because the dosage of antidiabetic may be adapted.
Patients, alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased Cholesterinspiegel, should ask their doctor or pharmacists if the dosage should be adapted to this drug.
It is recommended to meet additional fluctuation periods in order to prevent any failure of oral contraceptions in the case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).
Both in a study to interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Cicrid porin, a reduction of Cicrid is observed.
In use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulation in combination with orlistat might affect the Quick-values (international standard Ratio, INR) (see section 4.8).
Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins in the standard area.
However, patients should be recommended before bedtime, a supplementary multivitamin supplement must be taken to ensure adequate vitaminase (see section 4.4).
After the gift of a single dose Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers that simultaneously received orlistat, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.
Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and related with the pharmacological effects of the medicine, as absorption of taken fat is prevented.
The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.
The skins are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10, < 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1,000) and very rare (< 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invalable).
The prevalence of certain side effects, which were noted after the market launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unwanted size.
† It is plausible that the treatment with alli to convert alli in terms of possible and actual gastrointestinal side effects can lead.
Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multi-level doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without being significant clinical findings.
During the majority of reported cases reported by orlistat overdoation, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.
Based on examinations on human and animal, the effects on human and animal may be derived from a fast reversing of systemic effects that are attributable to orlistat's properties.
The therapeutic effect is set up in the lumens of the stomach and the upper fertilizer, by coalente ties to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and Panamanian Lipasen.
Clinical trials was derived from clinical trials that 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day, absorption of approximately 25% of the food fatty acids.
Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalory, fatty fish produced diet.
The primary parameters, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomization), was assessed as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of course (table 1) and as a proportion of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).
Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the largest weight loss in the first 6 months occurred.
The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).
The average change of the LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).
The average change was -4,5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value: 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).
Plasma percentage of non-metabolised orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral surgery of 360 mg of orlistat (< 5 ng / ml).
7 In general, non-sporadic orlistat could not only sporadic orlistat in plasma and at very low concentrations (< 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any indication of a cumulation.
In a study involving adipous patients, which was administered at least systemic absorbated dose, M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 based on the breakdown of the N-Formyl group) were identified, resulting in nearly 42% of the total plastic surgery.
Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity, canogenicity potential and reproduction, the precepatic data cannot be seen in human subjects.

Alli is used for weight reduction and is used for over 18 years with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 or above. alli should be used in conjunction with a low-fat and low-calorie diet.
The BMI helps to determine if you have a normal weight in relation to your body size, or are overweight.
Even if these disorders unnecessarily lead you feel uncomfortable, you should still ask your doctor to check out a control checkout.
For each of 2 kg body weight you can lose as part of a diet, you can lose an additional kilogram with the help of alli.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken any other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.
Cicrid porin is used according to organ transplantations, in severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases. • Warfarin or other drugs that have a blooddilute effect.
Oral receptionate detergents and alli • The effect of oral contractive means for pregnancy-contracting (pill) is weakened by circumstances or repealed if you have strong diarrhoea (diarrhea).
Please apply before taking alli to your doctor or pharmacists when you take: • Amiodarone for the treatment of heart rhythmias. • Acarbons to treat diabetes.
Ask your doctor or pharmacists when you take alli and if you're using medicines for high blood pressure, because the dosage may be adapted to high cholesterol because the dosage may be adapted.
How to define your calory targets and fetuses, you can learn more information on the blue pages in section 6.
If you have a meal or meal no fat, take no capsule. alli can only act if the food contains fat.
If you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal, which contains too much fat, do risk-related guides (see section 4).
In order to accustom your body to the new eating habits, begin in front of the first capturing with a low-calorie-fat diet.
Nutrition show sheets are effective, as you can accomplish at any time, what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits.
To ensure your target weight, you should set two daily objectives in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.
• Alloy fatty acid in order to reduce the probability of malnutrition-related guides (see section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.
Remember to ask your doctor if you are not familiar with physical activity. • Stay while taking and after completion of alli physically active.
• alli must not be taken longer than 6 months. • If you can find no reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
Under circumstances, you must end the taking of alli. • At a successful weight loss, it is not about to turn the diet and return to the old habits.
• When less than one hour has passed since the last meal, take the intake of capsule after. • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal, take no capsule.
Blood vessels with and without oily outlet, sudden or increased chair (and soft faeces) are due to the action mechanism (see section 1).
Severe allergic reactions • serious allergic reactions take you to the following changes: severe shortness, welds, skin rash, itching, swelling in the face, heart rate, circulatory collapse.
29 Very common side effects These can occur in more than 1 of 10 people that are alli. • flatulence (flatulence) with and without oily exit • Weibel chair informing your doctor or pharmacists when one of these side effects will be amplified or significantly impaired.
Frequent side effects These can occur in 1 of 10 people that are alli are taking. • stomach (stomach) pain, • Incontinence / fluid chair • increased chair • Beklemmings informing your doctor or pharmacists when one of these side effects will be amplified or significantly impaired.
Effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur. • Increase of certain Liver Enzymes • Effects on blood clots in patients who are using warfarin or other blood-diluted (anticoagiating) medicines.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.
The most common adverse events are related to the effectiveness of the capsules, thereby resulting in increasing fat from the body.
These side effects occur usually within the first weeks after treatment begins, since you have not yet been consistently reduced to the fat content in the diet.
With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits: • Begin a few days or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fetal diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and about the size of the portions you usually take.
If you know exactly how much you eat, the probability that you will exceed your fat limit. • share your recommended fat quantity evenly on your daily meals.
Save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal, not to take them in form of low-fat main court or a complete dessert, like you may occur in other programs for weight loss. • Most people with those accompanying them will learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet.
• Store medicines for children unaccessible. • Do not store alli in order to protect the contents from moisture. • Do not hold the container tightly closed to protect the content from moisture. • The bottle contains two white-sealed containers with silicagel which serve to keep the capsules dry.
If you don't swallow this at any case. • You can run your daily dose alli in the blue transport box (shuttle) which each pack is enclosed.

Overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of emergence of various severe illnesses such as: • high blood pressure • diabetes • heart disease • cerebrooarthritis • osteoarthritis, with your physician about your risk for these illnesses.
A durable weight loss, for example, by improving the diet and more movement, can prevent the removal of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health.
Choose meals which contain a wide range of nutrients, and learn to feed permanently healthy.
Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as indication of the packaging of food. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day.
Note the tables below in this section. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal.
Which quantity for you is suitable, take the below information provided by the number of calories that is suitable for you. • Due to mode of mode, compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial.
When you take the same amount of fat as previously, it can mean that your body can't process these amount of fat.
By respecting the recommended fat intake, you can maximize the weight loss and reduce the probability of malnutrition-related privileges. • They should try to gradually take off gradually.
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight and continuously about 0.5 kg per week, without frustrations and disappointments.
The more active you are, the higher is your recommended calorie intake. • "Geringe physical activity" means that you can burn daily 150 kcal daily, e.g. by 3 km walk, 30- to 45-minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.
• For a lasting weight loss, it is necessary to put realistic cold and fat targets and keep it. • Useful is a diet application with data to calori- and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.
The alli program to support the weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calori- and fettredues to feed and be physically active.
In combination with any type of cut-off program to support the weight loss, you can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and reach your target weight.
Aloxi is applied to chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as in chemical therapies (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).
The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic treatment).
The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information.
This means that the substance means the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.
Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.
In chemical therapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi alone showed no vomiting (132 from 223), compared with 57% associated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).
In chemical therapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi alone showed no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).
In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).
In March 2005, the European Commission informed the Company of Helsinki, Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an authorization of bringing aloxi funds across the European Union.
Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate-etogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.
The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced through a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a given Corticosteroids.
Since Palonosetron can extend the colon tape, patients with anamnesty or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored after injection.
However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable with the same gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or which tend to have an extension.
In connection with a further chemotherapeutic gift, Aloxi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy, nor to prevent any treatment of nausea and vomiting.
In clinical trials, Palonosetron uninhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).
In a clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steam-state- concentration oral metoclopramids of an CYP2D6 inhibitors.
In one population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous production of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (dexametidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, iinidine, serapaline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.
Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnancy, unless it is considered as needed by the treatment doctor.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly stood by Aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstacpation (5%).
Very rare cases (< 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.
In the group with the highest dosage, similar skies of adverse events appeared in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.
There were no dialysis studies conducted because of the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not an effective treatment with a Aloxi- exaggeration.
In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-value 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-value 7.3 hours) received intravenously on day 1 without a dexamethason intravenous.
In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 mcg Palonosetron received patients compared to 32 mg of Ondante that were given to day 1 intravenously.
Results of trials with moderately-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy have been summed up in the following tables.
In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable to the effects of Ondanlla and Dolasetron.
According to the findings of the clinical investigation, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ionricular De- and Repolarisation involved ionic channels and extend the duration of the action point.
The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EKG-effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.
Resorption After intravenous administration follows a initial decrease in Plasmaconzentorations a slow Elimination from the body with an average season half-value of about 40 hours.
The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in the total dose range of 0,3- 90 m / kg in socially and cancer patients.
After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 high-cell carcinoma (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.
Out of pharmacokinetic simulations that at once daily, intravenous intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron reaches a value of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher after one-time intravenous administration; however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher.
Approximately 40% are eliminated from the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have compared to Palonosetron beyond less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.
In-vitro studies for metabolised have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.
Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made as unchangeable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.
After a one-one intravenous Bolusine projection at the heart of the whole body, the full-body levels was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.
Although patients with severe liver function disorders, the terminale elimination period and the average systematic exposure with Palonosetron increases, but reducing the dose is not justified.
In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered sufficient on the maximum of human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a small relevance to clinical use.
10. clinical trials are indications that Palonosetron can only block ion channels only in very high concentrations of ion channels that can extend at the ventricular De- and Repolarisation.
High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neopsis (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, ornierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.
The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the used high dosages and da Aloxi for unique use is determined, the relevance of these results is minimal.
The holders of this authorization, the European Commission must inform the plans for placing on the market in the framework of this decision.
• If one of the adverse events may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information, please inform your doctor.
• Aloxi is a clear, colorless injection solution for injection into a Vene. • The substance (Palonosetron) belongs to a group of drugs that may cause nausea and vomiting. • Aloxi is used to prevent nausea and vomiting which may occur in connection with chemotherapy for cancer.
21 For application of Aloxi with other drugs. please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines / apply or applied recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.
Pregnancy If you are pregnant or trying to be pregnant, your doctor will not give you Aloxi unless it is clear.
Ask before taking all drugs to your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or believe in getting pregnant.
In some very rare cases it came to allergic reactions to Aloxi or burn or pain at the insertion location.
As aloxi looks and contents of the package Aloxi injection solution is a clear, colorless solution and is available in a package with 1 pouml of glass, which contains 5 ml of the solution.

In June 2006, the Committee for Human Immunology (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the failure of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution.
This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferone-A with the same arztably effective element that is already approved in the EU (also called "" "" reference agent "" ""). "" "
Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-called) hepatitis C (a virus infection caused by a virus infection).
A microscopic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood standard.
It is produced by a yeast to stimulate a gene (DNA) to stimulate this to the formation of the active ingredient.
The manufacturer of Alpheon laid data on the comparison of Alpheon with Roferone-A (active structure, composition, and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and effectiveness in Hepatitis C).
In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients.
The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).
(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or Distribution of this document is Authorised for non business, only the EMEA is. what were the greatest concerns caused by the CHMP to dispose the approval for placing on the market?
Furthermore, concerns were indicated that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the marketable drugs.
The number of patients with Hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferone-A, was similar in the clinical trial.
After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retardant with more patients than with the reference agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.
Apart from this, the test was used in the study to investigate the question, in which the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.
It may be used for the treatment of impetigo (one with crust-running skin infection) and small infected Lazerations (Riss- or chiabated), scutations and sewn wounds.
Altargo should not be used to treat infections, demonstrably, or presumably by methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo does not affect this type of infection.
Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the treatment area should not be more than 2% of the body surface.
If the patient is not addressing the treatment for two to three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient and draw alternative treatments in consideration.
It works through blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.
Major indicators of the effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was removed after the end of treatment.
119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients were treated to placebo.
In the treatment of infected hounds, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates showed: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups were addressed to the treatment.
In these two studies, however, it has found that Altargo has been caused by treatment of abscesses (vanity cases in body tissues) or infections, which have been provoked or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.
The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation in the contractor.
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo in short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections caused by the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, scents or palsy wounds.
In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an authorization of the establishment of Altargo across the European Union.
Patients, with which there is no improvement in two to three days, should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).
In case of a sensitisation or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is abolished, the ointment carefully detect and an adequate alternative therapy of infection are started.
Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infection where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).
In clinical trials in secondary uninfected wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.
Alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.
The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.
Due to the low plasma percentage, which have been achieved when humans have been achieved for topical use of skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).
3 For the current gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin salbe on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.
Due to the minor system exposure to topical application in patients, Dosiscustomizations are not required if topical retriapamulin was used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.
Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive treatments and are inadequate regarding a statement of effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Retapamulin Salbe should be only applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear, and the use of Retapamulin is to be preferable to an systemic antibiotic.
At the decision whether the breastfeeding continued / finished or terminated with Altargo, it is between the use of breastfeeding for infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.
In clinical trials at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which used Altargo, the most frequently reported adverse effect on the administration, which concerned about 1% of patients.
Mode of mode retinapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from the fermentation of clitochus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).
The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding station of the 50s subdivision of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the obligations of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.
The data indicates that the association of ribosomic protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-bonds and the PeptidyltransferaseCentre.
By binding on this binding, Pelromutiline transfer the peptidyltransfer, partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomic subunits.
Should be based on the basis of the local prevalent resistance to the use of Retapamulin at least some Infection forms, an advice should be targeted by experts.
There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.
In case of failure to treatment in S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.
Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin Salbe was charged with occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.
Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary ininfected wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.
The sampling took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.
However, the maximum individual systemic uptake of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.
Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).
In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.
In-vitro review on genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-microkerntest for in-vivo test chromosomal effects.
There was neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to the people (topical application to 200 cm2):
In an embryotoxicity study on rats the oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (declining weight of fetus and delayed ossification) were detected.
The holder of the permit must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system is present, as in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation order (version 6.2), and works before the product is marketed as long as the product is marketed.
The holder of approval for the domestic office is obligated to perform detailed detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the application order, as well as all additional updates by the RMP, which will be agreed with the CHMP.
As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medical use," the updated RMP will simultaneously be submitted to the next periodic Safety Update Report.
Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated place, you should end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.
Do not apply any other salts, creams, or lotions on the area that is treated with Altargo, if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor.
It must not be applied in eyes, mouth or mouth, in the nose or in the female genital area.
If the ointment is out of view on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor to advice if complaints occur.
After filling the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterilised bandage or a gazing tape, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.
It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag, which contains 0,5 grams of salt.
Amidrix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (illnesses that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.
The Ambirix is applied to an existing vaccine, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose.
For this reason, Ambirix is only allowed if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the existing vaccine can be taken at the end of two doses.
If a refreshment dose against hepatitis A or B is required, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.
Vaccines have "contribute to the immune system (the body's natural defense system)," as it can fight against illness.
After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies.
Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix Adults and who has been approved in 1997 for Twinrix Children since 1997.
The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same illnesses, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given an existing vaccine.
Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data used to support the application of Twinrix adults, also as proof for the use of Ambirix.
The main indicators for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody after the last injection.
In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.
Amnesty conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B.
The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix looks like a sixth and a 12-month distance between the injections.
The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, redness, redness, fatigue (fatigue) and irritability.
Amidrix may not react sensitively to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).
In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologís.a. an authorization of the surrounding area of Ambirix in the entire
The standardization plan for the basic base with Ambirix consists of two vaccine doses, whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.
If a refresher is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalents vaccine or with a combination vaccine.
The anti-hepatitis - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HLW) virus and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size, according to the vaccination with the respective monovalents vaccine.
It is not fully assured, whether immunogeneous individuals who have addressed a hepatitis A- vaccination is a protective chimney as protection, as it may also be protected by immunological memory as well.
3 As with all injection substances, the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction should be immediately available after the gift of the vaccine appropriate options of medical treatment and monitoring.
If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
In case of havalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody being achieved so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required.
Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration may result in a suboptimal pulse result, these injections should be avoided.
However, amrombocytopenie or blood coagulation disorders can be injected, however, amusing subcutaneous injections, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.
If Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azellular Pertus- and Haemophilus influenza virus (DTPA-IPV / Hib), or a combined Masern- Mumps-Röttle vaccine was given, was the immune response to all antigens sufficient (see Section 5.1).
Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly sufficient immune response is achieved.
In a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 vaccinations of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, mateness, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable with the frequency, which was observed in previous Thiomersale- and preservative inoculation.
In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.
In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans-combination vaccine.
Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and activity on a computed basis per vaccine ambient amrix, but not on a computation basis per person.
Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 57% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects as a result of a dose of 3-cans-combination vaccine.
According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had gotten ambushings had been vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.
However, the frequency of matriness was similar (i.e. about the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received amusrix compared with 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-cans-combination vaccine).
The frequency of impregnated pain and matridity was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with a 3-cans inocschema.
In a comparison study of 1-11 year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reaction and general reactions were comparable to the ambition associated with the 3-cans-combination vaccine with a 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
However, after the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a little more common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, reports.
The proportion of vaccines that have caused serious side effects during the 2 doses of vaccinations, with ambition or during the 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, was not different.
In clinical trials involving vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years were the serum-conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 abort dose (i.e. in month 7).
The serum conversion rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 aborted dose (i.e. in month 7).
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, there were 142 two doses ambirix and 147 the standard combined fuel with three doses.
At 289 people whose immunogeneity was compensated, the serum samples (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with the amidst of the 3-dose of hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose.
The immune response, which have been reached in a clinical comparison study of 1- to 11-year-olds within a month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), listed in the following table.
In both studies, the vaccine received either a 2-cans inocschema with amamrix or a 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
For individuals who were at the time of the basic idea between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immunisation with amatrix in the 0-6 months vaccination.
The immunal reaction against both antigens was comparable to the vaccine of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.
In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination upside to the 0-12 months vaccination.
If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year is at the same time the dripping of a combined diphtheriac, Tetanus-, azellular Pertusis-, inactivated Poliomyelitis (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.
A clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, showed similar Seroprotors and Seroconvergence as well as for the former formulation.
The vaccine is to investigate any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes in both cases and / or physical visible changes.
Pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state of state release of a state laboratory, or one of this purpose, authorized lab performed.

The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foodstuffs and drinks, but can also be transferred by other ways, such as swimming in the waters decontaminated waters.
You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.
As with all vaccines, ambusrix cannot fully protect against an infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.
If you are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick / feel at the time of the vaccination), an inoculation cannot prevent a disease.
Any protection against other infections caused by the liver, or cause symptoms that are similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.
• If your child once showed an allergic reaction to Ambirix or some part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).
An allergic reaction can be uttered by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the recommended administration of the second vaccination).
A possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination is given to you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.
Instead, he will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).
The second vaccination dose of this vaccine will be administered with reduced content of effective content, usually a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against the vaccination series before termination of the vaccination.
Sometimes, amidrix are injected with severe blood clots, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • if you are weakened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / its own immune system / is / or if you / your child undergo to a hemalysis / or undergo.
Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals can't be sufficient, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on the vaccination.
21. ask your doctor if you are taking your child further medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated / has been given / has been given or Immunglobulins (antibodies) is planned / has been planned in the near future.
However, it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.
If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as possible limbs.
If Ambirix are at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be enough.
It is usually not given to be pregnant or lactating women, except it is urgently needed to be vaccinated for hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have seen an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).
If you miss the agreed date for the second inoculation, talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible.
♦ very frequent (more than 1 case per 10 impregnated doses): • pain or discomfort at the insertion or redness • Maternity • headache • loss of appetite

Other side effects, days or weeks after the inoculation with comparable combinations of hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 doses) are reported:
These include local or extensive precipitation, the itching can be or blistering, swelling of the eyes and the face, a value of breathing or swallowing, sudden blood pressure and loss of loss.

Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and available in packs of 50 without needles.
Based on the data, which has become known since issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP agreed that the benefit of the benefit ratio for Ambirix remains positive.
However, da amrix are only limited in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited to the low patient position.
Ammonaps may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defective or hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonitions) in history.
Ammonaps is divided into several single doses of meals - swallowed by food or over a gastrostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach-leading hose) or a nose probe (with the nose into the stomach-leading hose).
It was not a comparative study because Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a hypothalate medicine, i.e. without active substance).
Ammonaps may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, liquid effects, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps prevented in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle to high ammonials.
"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "extraordinary conditions" "" "because of the disease of the disease only limited information on this drug." ""
The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme deficiency already in newborns (within the first 28 days).
In patients with a late-party form (incomplete enzyme defective, which is manifest after the first life of life), an indication of the use when in the history a hyperspacial encephalopathy exists.
For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with gorges, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.
The daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.
According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.
In patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamase is the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.
Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.
AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with gorcking disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera, if the tablets are not able to get into the stomach immediately.
Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) containing sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.
Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore insufficiency in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and oedetion in clinical states only with caution.
As a metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with external caution.
The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).
During the subcutaneous gift of phenylacetic to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of the neurons and resulted in a increased loss of neurons.
It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.
It could not be noted if Phenylacetate is out of the human breast in the breast milk and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS was contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).
In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE), and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.
The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, < 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
An likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old anorealist patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose tin, severe hypokalemia, Panzyenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.
A case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month-old small child with a healthy single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).
These symptoms go with accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed dosistive neurotoxicity with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.
Phenylacacetate is a metabolic active compound which conjugated by acetylamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.
Phenylacetylene is comparatively similar to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.
5 patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat is produced between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.
It is important that the diagnosis was granted early and treatment immediately, to improve survival for survival and clinical outcome.
The prognosis of the earliest symptoms of the disease with occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infested, and the disease led to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking-free analoga within the first year of life.
Due to havalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetic), proteins reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first life of life) diagnosed with 80%.
In patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate came with many to many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.
In patients with a late-ogeneous form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of ornithintranteratocyylase deficiency), which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and reduced diet permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a diet reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.
Even existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition occur.
It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacacetate which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.
The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were treated according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in sober-related healthy adults, hemoglobal metabolism and liver cirrhosis according to individual charges and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).
The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients following intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.
After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma percentage (phenylbutyrat) were detected.
In the majority of patients with urea fatigue or hemoglobbinopathy was detectable after various doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, no phenylacetic in plasma.
In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma concentration were five times higher than the first gifts.
Excretion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated production phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.
According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clastogenic effects in rats no clastogenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).
AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral, infants and children who can't swallow any tablets, or patients with gorcking disorders) or over a Gastrostomieschi or a nostride.
According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.
The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.
In patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamase is the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.
AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) containing sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.
If rat necessities were exposed to the birth of phenylacetic (active Metabolic lit by Phenylbutyrat), it came into lesions in the pyramids of the cortex.
An likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old anorealist patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose tin, severe hypokalemia, Panzyenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.
Phenylacetylene is comparatively similar to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess weight
On the basis of research on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat produces between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.
Existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition occur.
After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations were detected by phenylbutyrat.
During the duration of durability, the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.
In this case the small measuring scoop 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.
If a patient must have received the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).
In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver preparations are missing, so they can not exterminate the sticky waste products, which can accumulate after consumption of proteins in the body.
When using laboratory studies, you need to inform the doctor that you are using AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.
When using AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs.
During the lactation time you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS, as the medicine could go over to breast milk and damage your baby.
In rare cases confusion, headache, flavours, reverse the hearing, disorientates, memory deficits and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.
If you find one of these symptoms at oneself, please contact your doctor or contact your hospital emergencies in the introduction of a corresponding treatment.
If you have forgotten the intake of AMMONAPS, take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal.
Changes of blood images (red blood cells, white blood cells, throatocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, uncomfortable skin rash, rash, kidney dysfunctions, weight gain and abnormal laboratories.
Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.
You may not use AMMONAPS after switching on the box and the extent of "usable up to" given expiry date no longer.
Like AMMONAPS look and contents of the AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish colour and oval shape, and they are equipped with the embossing "UCY 500."
30 If there are laboratory studies, you need to notify the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.
When using AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs.
You should take AMMONAPS distributed in same single doses or via a stomach feeble (hose, runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach) or a nose probe (hose, which is led by the nose into the stomach).
31 • Take a heaped measuring scoop Granules. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a measuring reed above the edge of the knife to remove surplus granulate. • Take the recommended number of measuring scoop Granules from the container.
Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in chest basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "St- Hebung" (an abnormal measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).
If angiox is used to prevent clots in patients who undergo a PCI is administered a higher dose and infusion can be continued up to four hours after surgery.
This can contribute in patients with angina or palms to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.
Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared with the conventional combination of heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI compared.
While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube, which remains in the Arterie to prevent a shutter), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.
The treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - during the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment.
In patients who undergo a PCI was angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparine, except for serious bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparine.
Angiox may not be used in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) or any of the other components.
It must not be applied in patients who recently had a blood pressure, as well as with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.
The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) came to the conclusion that angiox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a midable replacement for Heparin.
In September 2004, the European Commission announced the Medicines Company UK Ltd. an authorization of angiox in the entire European Union.
Treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI) is scheduled for emergency access or if early intervention is scheduled.
The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.
If one PCI is performed in further sequence a PCI should be given, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.
After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.
Directly before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.
The recommended dosage for angiox in patients with a PCI is comprised of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.
The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.
If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be done.
In order to reduce the occurrence lower ACT values, the constitutional and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the Bolusdosage rapidly intravenous intravenous.
Once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg of infusion is administered correctly.
In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), the one PCI is treated (whether using Bivalirudin versus ACS or not), a lower incidence rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.
If the ACT-value is 225 mg / kg, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is to be dismayed and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt.
In patients with moderate kidney disease, which included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which included for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin Bolus without Dosisadaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.
3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR < 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).
Treatment with angiox takes 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous gift of untreated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous gift of low-molecular heparin.
• more known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other hemoraneous hemoraneous hemoraneous hemoraneous hemophilia. • severe kidney disease and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR < 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients
Patients are carefully monitored in relation to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).
Even if in PCI-patients under Bivalirudin, most bleedings on arterial points can occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during the treatment of principle of bleeding.
In patients who are using Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin should be considered to be a monitoring of the INR value (international normalised ratio) to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalirudine reaches the treatment existing prior to the treatment.
Based on the knowledge of an anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregated shemmer), this active ingredients may be increased.
In any case the combination of Bivalirudin aggregated aggregates or anticoagulcipes are the clinical and biological hemogstaseparameter in any case regularly.
The experimental tests are inadequate regarding the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, inadequate or postnatal development insufficient (see section 5.3).
4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either untreated Heparine or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.
In both the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups associated with heparin, there were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.
Severe bleeding were defined after ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding, as defined in table 2.
Both slight and heavy bleeding occurs less frequently than in groups associated with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).
An ACUITY was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in a diameter of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood pressure, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood pressure, Reoperation due to a blood circulation, application of blood products for transfusion.
More, less frequently observed blood circulation, which occurred with more than 0,1% (occasionally), "others" puncture, retroperitoneal, gastromares, ear, nose or neck.
The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study involving Bivalirudine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.
In both the Bivalirudine group as well as in the comparison groups associated with heparin, there were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.
Both light and heavy bleeding occurs less frequently than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.
The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are listed in table 6 in table 6.
In case of transitions, treatment with bivalirudine immediately break off and the patient engmaschig in relation to monitor signs of bleeding.
Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinocor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as at the animonenbindenting region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.
The bonds of Bivalirudin at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin turn up the bond of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby creating the function of the active center of thrombin regenerates.
In addition, bivalirudine induced thrombocytopenie / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) had come to inducing no thrombocytes-reaction.
In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dosis- and concentration-dependant anticoagulation effect that is proved by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.
If a PCI was performed on the following in the case, an additional Bolus of 0,5mg / kg of Bivalirudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.
In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI).
Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the start of angiography (at the time of Randomanization) or the PCI.
In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients required an angiography within 72 hours, evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.
About 77% of patients had recurrent Ischaemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent surgery in 72 hours of angiography.
The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-tage- and the 1 yearly-point for the total population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol (prior to angiography or before the PCI), are displayed in spreadsheets 7 and 8.

The 30-day results, based on four and triple-endpoints of a randomized double-blind study with more than 6,000 patients underwent a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.
Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided information about the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.
The pharmacokinetic features of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coral intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.
It is expected that Bivalirudine as Peptide has a catabolic in its amino acid-components with subsequent re-exploitation of amino acids in the body-pool.
The primary metabolit, resulting from the split of the Arg3-Pro4-binding sequence of Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.
Elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with an terminale half-value of 25 ± 12 minutes.
Based on conventional studies for safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity, or reproduction, pre-clinical data do not recognize a particular dangers for the human being.
Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at a exposure to 10-degree of clinical steady state plasma) restricted to overshoot pharmacological effects.
Side effects following a longer-term physiological burden than reaction on a non-homoostatic coagulation were not comparable to those in clinical use, even with very much higher dose, not observed.
Provided in the production of the ready-to-use solution 17 not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.
Angiox is a fright rocking powder in single dose of type 1-glass to 10 ml, sealed with a butyl rubber plug and sealed cap out of pressed aluminium.
5 ml. of water for injection purposes are given into a side bottle of angiox and slightly inclined until everything has been completely dissolved and the solution is clear.
5 ml. are taken from the side bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0,9%) in an injection solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalirudin.
The holder of the approval for the domestic product is to be led to the studies and pharmacovigilance activities, as agreed in version 4 of the risk management plan (RMP) and presented in module 1.8.2 the approval for placing on the market, and each successive changes of the RMP, which was agreed by the CHMP.
According to CHMP Guideline to risk management systems for medical care, the revised RMP should be submitted to the next periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
• Patients with breast pain due to a heart disease (acute coronary syndrome - ACS) • patients who are operated on the treatment of disclosures in blood vessels (angioplasty and / or percutaneous coral angioplasty - PCI).
• She pregnant or assume that you could be pregnant? they plan to become pregnant with you at the moment.
There were no investigation of the effects on traffic noise and the ability to serve machines, but you know that the effects of this medication is only short-term.
Should a bleeding occur, the treatment with angiox is aborted. • Before the injection or infusion, you will inform your doctor about the possible signs of allergic reaction.
Such reactions are rarely (they occur in less than 1 of 1000 patients treated). • A particularly careful surveillance is performed if you supply a radiation therapy for the vessels that receive the heart with blood (this treatment is called beta- or gamma-brachytherapy). • The dose that you will receive from your body weight and from the kind of therapy you receive.
• 0.1 mg / kg of body weight than injection followed by an infusion (tropical shed) with 0,25 mg / kg body weight means a tenth of one millimetre of the drug for each kilogram of body weight; 0,25 mg / kg of body weight per hour means a quarter of a millimetre of the drug for each kilogram of body weight per hour.
More likely if angiox is administered in combination with other gerinned or antithrombal medication (see section 2 "At the application of angiox in other drugs").
These are occasional side effects (less than 1 of 100 treated patients). • Thrombosis (blood clots) that could lead to serious complications such as heart failure.
This is a random side effect (less than 1 of 100 treated patients). • pain, bleeding and bruising from the puncture (after a PCI treatment).

Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes, requiring treatment with insulin.
Apidra is subcutted subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or is administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.
Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot produce sufficient insulin control of glucose (sugar) in the blood or process the insulin.
Insulin lulisin differs a very low level of human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter mode has more than a short-effective human insulin.
Apidra was used in the application in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.
In type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effectively in the body, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.
The main indicators for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glyphylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.
In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% at insulin lispro.
In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% compared to six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human level insulin.
Apidra must not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) against insulin injections or any of the other components, or in patients who suffer from a hypoglycemia.
The cans of Apidra must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose levels.
In September 2004, the European Commission approved the Company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the establishment of Apidra in the entire European Union.
Apidra is administered as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or Deltamuskels or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.
Due to the reduced glucose monitoring capacity and the diminished insulin injections, the insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be diminished.
Any change of the active force, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand.
3 A inadequate dosage or treatment of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin paid diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these states are potentially life threatening.
Adjustment of one patient on another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.
The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active account of the insulin-related insulin profile and can therefore change to transformation of the treatment scheme.
To the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, oral antidiabetic, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifine, propoxylic, saliperate and sulfonamide antibiotics.
Additionally, the symptoms of sympatholytics such as fraudulous, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserves can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adrenergen counterfences.
Animal experiments on Reproductive Toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
It is unknown whether the insulin injectors are exaggerated in human breast milk but generally, insulin does not occur in the mother's milk, nor is it resorised to oral application.
In the following, the clinical trials listed in clinical trials are listed, grouped by system organs and are frequent: ≥ 1 / 10, < 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10, < 1 / 1,000; very rare: < 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1,000; very rare: < 1 / 10,000, < 1 / 1,000; very rare: < 1 / 10,000.
Cold - silent, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.
Lipodystrophy Will fails to alternate the injection of injections within the injection range, in a row a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.
Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be treated using a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an equivalent person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a physician.
After a glued projection, the patient should be supervised in a hospital in order to determine the cause of cause severe hypoglycemia and similar episodes.
Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose in the liver.
Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the mode of operation is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.
In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lulisations showed a dose of proportional gluing effect, and at 0.3 A / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose tolerance effect, precisely as human insulin.
Insulin lulisin has twice as fast efficiencies, such as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose tolerance effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.
The data was clearly stated that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postdenial glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal.
Insullulisin 2 minutes before the meal was grounded, a better post-denial control was given as a human normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal.
If insullulisin 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control like in human normal insulin is given (see Figure 1), is achieved.
Insulin lulant in the gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal has been given in comparison to human level, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human level, 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).
After the beginning of the meal, insulin luliseth was given at the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was 2 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).
