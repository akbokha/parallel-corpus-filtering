it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Ac@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ments ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients lack a normal mood ( periods of abnormal high @-@ spirit ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Ab@@ ol@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased ag@@ itation or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral medication is not possible .
in both cases the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablets in patients , which make the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are using other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in smaller measurements than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter affects to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin brings a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were compared to placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol in another study , to prevent the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo in a different study compared to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ ists was enrolled in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours compared .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body re@@ adily absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to interv@@ ene ( decreases ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented us up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Ab@@ ol@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions decreased in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also effective as placebo perceived their symptoms of rest@@ lessness and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( constant motion ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , tum@@ ble hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the conclusion that led to the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injec@@ tion@@ ists in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ian episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission approved the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an auth@@ orization of the establishment of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate to serious ep@@ is@@ al episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , mainly man@@ ic episodes , and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justi@@ fiable ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ tic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ours belong to mental disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or following an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder does not have increased su@@ ici@@ ality risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ oten@@ sion ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

if treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients who occur signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns or imp@@ aired high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be depos@@ ited , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
thus , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of sei@@ zu@@ res or states that are related with sei@@ zu@@ res in relation to caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients associated with psych@@ oses that were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to placebo .
there was , however , in one of those studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for undes@@ i@@ rable vas@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
Hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
in general , a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is observed and an un@@ healthy li@@ fel@@ ine is observed and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system is caution , when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with out@@ lay side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resignation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers an effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common use of high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations arise from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should exceed potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , must have similar effects , and therefore , similar dose reductions should be performed .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose of absor@@ bing therapy before the start of the companion .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zene ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to inadequate data security to humans and due to the concerns of reproductive studies in the animal studies , this medication may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against them , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ ath@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ thia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was placebo in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in a different long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were detected , did not mean medical significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo treated patients .
among the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ies and sei@@ zu@@ res , adverse mortality of dementia cases , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ated over@@ do@@ si@@ es were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ og@@ li@@ z@@ ole in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ v@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ flow of benefits , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder has the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine di@@ 4- , ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
during the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ d@@ us and at the pl@@ um .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week , 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities of patients who have a response to study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement aspects , defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks on stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was below 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ ole Group and 57 % in placebo .
in an ov@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a placebo @-@ superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ z@@ ole over to placebo no superior efficacy .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a placebo effect in week 3 and a maintenance effect , which was comparable to the lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also proved a compar@@ ative share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission in the mania , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not appear on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy at therapeutic Ser@@ p@@ ole . compared to monopol@@ y symptoms in comparison to Mon@@ otherapy , with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion in certain patients that had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before Rand@@ om@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up to placebo particularly in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar withdrawal .

the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients had no sexually depend@@ ant effects .
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of a smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic features of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw on their metabolic capacity .

Hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study of healthy volunteers an effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder has the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an ov@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ z@@ ole over to placebo no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Exceptional It was found as a result of the removal of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral surgery from 25 to 125 mg / kg ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of people based on people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rabbits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold in the medium @-@ scale Ste@@ am State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of anxiety and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ian episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a oral therapy is not appropriate .
once there is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole can be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the absorption and minim@@ ize vari@@ ability , injection is recommended to the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under b@@ yp@@ assing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be ordered depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or ac@@ utely @-@ therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to interv@@ ene .
there are no investigation regarding the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with am@@ ic@@ ir@@ cul@@ inity and behavi@@ oral disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ian episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines additionally needed to be considered necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations of the safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tion@@ ists are not present for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical pois@@ oning ( due to mal@@ ice or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ oten@@ sion ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hypertension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ arian : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ luft
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness failure and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed and an un@@ healthy li@@ fel@@ ine is observed and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , intensity of Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) in a study which was intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ ated in healthy volunteers ( 15 mg dose ) and intra@@ mus@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist is fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid @-@ block@@ ers , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can result with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , must have similar effects , and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose of absor@@ bing therapy before the start of the companion .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined after the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) as possible ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was placebo in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were detected , did not mean medical significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo treated patients .
among the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ies and sei@@ zu@@ res , adverse mortality of dementia cases , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and at@@ titudes and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ oral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed middle improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes , or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ tives , a similar effectiveness in relation to total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be observed due to a reduced patient population .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week , 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities of patients who have a response to study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol 73 % in both groups .
current values of measurement aspects , defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an ov@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .

in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in certain patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up to placebo particularly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar withdrawal .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours following intra@@ muscular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously produced an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drug ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between pharmac@@ euticals as time as to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients , the silent or prior to the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ pers in the blood .
the Committee for Human Immun@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with whom the first treatment could not be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines are not necessary to reduce adverse reactions to other medicines in contrast to other medicines .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company Abra@@ sives Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted permission to privati@@ ze Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not displayed in standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ per &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
at sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to inter@@ rupt until a better level 1 or 2 is achieved , and at all the following cycles must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to excessive imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no clinical studies conducted with patients suffering from kidney function , and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjust@@ ments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to un@@ sufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic @-@ forming of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be essentially different pharmac@@ ological features than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ per rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with serious liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a unique Abra@@ x@@ ane was not detected in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient @-@ collective are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or kidney disease or lung disease .
if patients occur after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with common anti@@ em@@ eal and con@@ sti@@ ff@@ icient funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be practic@@ ed at pregnant or women in a bu@@ oy@@ ant age , which does not practice an effective receiver of contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible .
women in common age should use a reliable reference method for up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised during and up to six months after the treatment of no child .
male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm hospital , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and dizziness ( frequently ) , which can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
these are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III clinical trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most remarkable h@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 speci@@ fies the side effects that occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ drug that promotes mer@@ ging the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular indi@@ genes and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bit of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the Trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plas@@ mac@@ om@@ components in the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this enhanced tran@@ sen@@ do@@ cking transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ogen receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( op@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the range of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two cat@@ ar@@ dy @-@ blind studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were randomised in a random@@ ized Phase III comparison study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ ent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ measurement of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for metast@@ asis and 19 % for met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy grade 3 evaluated .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy for abor@@ tion on Bas@@ eline , due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the effect position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 In the recommended clinical dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ enta has increased to a multi @-@ phase mod@@ ulation .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or crossover network of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients suffering from late solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of soluble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than according to a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily reduced to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was 4 % of the given total dose of less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to a vast non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
however , over 75 years of age , however , only a few data are available , because only 3 patients took part in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and before light light protected by 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed up a biological medicinal product is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood fer@@ encing factors which occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be led under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be done by the patient or their car@@ eg@@ i@@ ment@@ son , provided they have received a reasonable manual .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ ay in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the Iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency consists of iron weight , and iron supplement should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems can cause an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by means that the body does not suff@@ ice to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was placed as an injection into a V@@ ene in the context of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared to the reference agent .
all of the patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were either placed on se@@ ven@@ ding or remain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
major indicators for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25 @-@ 29 .
in addition , the company reported the results of a study in which the effects were examined by the skin inj@@ ected abor@@ tions with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients who suffer from kidney problems caused An@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were placed on ab@@ se@@ amed were obtained in the same degree as for those patients who continue to keep E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast , patients who continue to keep E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure which may occasionally cause symp@@ tom of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , side @-@ violent head@@ aches and confusion .
se@@ ven@@ ding may not be applied in patients that are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that these are caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) has reached the conclusion that the medicine has been achieved for ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which ab@@ uses ab@@ se@@ amed , is inform@@ ational for medical specialists in all Member States information , including information about the security of the drug .

HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are applied to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ tic program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
bacterial symptoms and fol@@ kl@@ ets can vary depending on the age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease insur@@ rection is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins in order to avoid more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in an patients individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in above or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) can be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is increased by 25 % .
the patients should be supervised to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ es@@ thetic symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance outlets than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance outlets than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on the age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) can be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the patients should be supervised to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of mi@@ tig@@ ation symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the vertical intake increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 kg / kg should be maintained three times per week or 450 people / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the vertical intake of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 i.e. / kg three times per week .

however , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ite value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the vertical intake increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 @-@ 39 % ) , with which the pre @-@ car@@ ing deposits of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative should be required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ tic program , we started to have large iron reserves before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .

Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurr@@ ence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of loss , the reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need of trans@@ fu@@ sions should be determined and the custom@@ ary causes for non @-@ speaking ( ice , fol@@ d@@ acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium @-@ loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is lower , considering the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes ) , and if no other cause is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined , and an investigation of the bone mar@@ ch@@ marks to diagnose a PR@@ CA diagnosis .

the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit of risk reduction in the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ trop@@ ic procedure should be , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa treatment , the cause of an@@ emia is investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go a larger elec@@ trop@@ hic procedure should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an under@@ lying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an output of an al@@ er@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl is an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled studies , ep@@ och@@ ine was not demonstrated that they improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tional risk of risk ( bone break ) , including in patients who had suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic v@@ int@@ ment as it drops out ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip @-@ correction should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can result in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is as in the zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was attracted to the review of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hips over a period of three years .
the second study involved 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years which had been recently under@@ gone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicators for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds a bone substance ) in the blood once again norm@@ alized or reduced by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study involving older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any O@@ steopor@@ osis accounts ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving males and women with hip @-@ correction 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients that are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as in all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ o@@ deficiency ( extinction of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw@@ s .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clari@@ fying material for physicians , which contains evidence of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug may be explained and pointed out , when they should apply to the doctor .

treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently in@@ qu@@ ered low @-@ trau@@ matic cl@@ ut@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in males one intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hil@@ ar@@ ment , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long pension period in patients have been observed ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic ke@@ gel @-@ correction , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data are missing for uncertainty and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) for patients with only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid submission of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid on the bone structure , a tran@@ sit@@ ory hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum is usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene , should be obtained from a use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a denti@@ fication with reasonable pre @-@ relief dental treatment .
for patients who require dental access , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ologists in the ja@@ w area .
the clinical assessment by the treatment physician should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefits of risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the prevalence of adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 % ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the tot@@ ality of provisions between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drugs effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid was associated with kidney function , which is associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase of kidney cancer ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure in connection .
the variation of the cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured each year before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure , as well as a restricted kidney function in the clinical trial of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory results , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ations in a large clinical study , treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip @-@ correction and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent ke@@ epers , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the ja@@ w area was acci@@ dental primarily in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the ja@@ w area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .

in case of an over@@ flow that leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be reached by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any indication of an existing flu@@ idi@@ ties .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric flu@@ xes A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly compared to all ages ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , of the total th@@ igh around 6.0 % , the steering angle of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic bone .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to placebo an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and ob@@ taining the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone structure mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were measured in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic@@ ally interval during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value in 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured by rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 - 12@@ 5,000 , oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ al was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D on the tot@@ als and scra@@ pers at all points of time .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a therapy resulted in the placebo @-@ treatment for 24 months to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in the total air and 4.3 % at the cock@@ at@@ op .
clinical efficacy in males In the Horizon R@@ FT study , 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was reduced to the percentage change in the progression of the lum@@ ber verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confir@@ ming , particularly light up to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
in combination with the combined results , a similar decrease in the pain relief and pain relief was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified at the end of the six months main study on the therapy were classified ( on the therapy ) , could be taken into an ob@@ itu@@ ary phase .
patients who took part in the follow @-@ up study was 141 of the patients who attended the follow @-@ up study compared with 71 members of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron , compared with 71 who were treated with cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in the middle duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes per@@ sever@@ ing in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma tor@@ ch increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase , no more than 0,1 % of the maximum value .
rapid @-@ phase of disappearance from the great cycle of half @-@ time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ h 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with an termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation sh@@ ale @-@ life t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent quick absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
extension of the in@@ fusion @-@ time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not metabolic because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , non @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patients ( see section 4.2 ) of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and at the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder until down to a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance until 35 ml / min does not require Dos@@ is@@ sion of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
due to severe kidney disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ able Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are not possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs were single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was determined with intraven@@ ous dose of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 3 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to 6 times in 3 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure referred to the AU@@ C , corresponding to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common clinical trials with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a fertili@@ zation , which reflects pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ icity with dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as an external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and the skel@@ eton of skel@@ etal .
there were no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects although the maternal toxic@@ ity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg due to the lowest serum @-@ calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , primarily est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place fast , and new bone material is sub@@ ordin@@ ated , which makes bone material we@@ aker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by re@@ forming the bone structure , thereby making a normal bone formation and ensures that the bone is rest@@ art@@ ed again .
if you are in dental treatment or use a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is additionally applied to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond or more .
in addition , four trials have been carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was employed in comparison to placebo as an support of the smoking .
the studies on the setting of the smoking showed no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to interv@@ ene on this application area .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? he is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were detected during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory system reported adverse effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects .
it may also be applied to patients who suffer from an existing serious depression or treated with anti@@ depress@@ ants , since it can cause the risk of depression and cause problems with a small minority of patients superf@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .

the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the effectiveness of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
drug may be applied to patients who need it from health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and motion for treatment of obesity ( BMI ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which are beyond one or several risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to mis@@ leading data regarding the effectiveness and uncertainty .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Services Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can &apos;t be used in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a cancer medicine ) can be applied together with other cancer medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ al or insulin can be preserved with the onset of acet@@ yl@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ al or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be utili@@ zed better and the blood sugar level is reducing , enabling type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ate was studied in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either acet@@ one or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ al hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the addition to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction , while the additional cure from placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of acet@@ one and insulin were examined at 289 patients , the patients who received acet@@ one in addition to insulin , a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ ants ) .
Ac@@ ting must not react in patients , which may react sensi@@ tively to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even with patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirror - aci@@ d@@ ration ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for placing Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white till whi@@ tish , round , ar@@ ched and wear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and with which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility is not suitable ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiac Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in heart failure showed , however , which led not to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of the liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are the liver @-@ enzy@@ matic values as soon as possible .
if a patient developed symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ matic values .
the decision , whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one continued to be continued , should be led to the presence of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be stirring by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ atology , under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a slight reduction in intermediate ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ on ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ way combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after the market launch , under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , has been reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ mic .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but a ord@@ n@@ ative doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ms if patients may report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of vision ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic sever@@ ance should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ red events in terms of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials have been treated with more than 8,@@ 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for a period of up to 3.5 years .
the reck@@ oned frac@@ ture incidence was 1,9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 rates per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or that occurs , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the examination of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ omen@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines referred to by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ ici@@ ally growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbul@@ ence and the re@@ inde@@ xes of the lens , such as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege occurred over three times the upper limit of the norm range , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the frequency of a heavy heart failure was 1.6 % higher than with placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w were more than placebo .
since the launch market has rarely been reported on heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure was used .
there was a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ red events in randomised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative surgical groups .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , Fra@@ k@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day after seven days have no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to act on activ@@ ating specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ative recur@@ ring rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose consumption in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the period until leaving the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients ( compared with 50 % of patients receiving G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin exposure , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo were random@@ ized .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continue to have insulin ; a reduction of insulin delivery in which was treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decline in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ quota compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small , dated 18 weeks analysis of type 2 diabe@@ tic .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and mar@@ gin@@ ally , but clinical not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .

compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d was observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the sober tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pon@@ ents of tri@@ glyc@@ eride levels , both with effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE trial , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were randomised to receive an existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy for either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is re@@ adily absor@@ bs , with the top concentrations in fixed pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to its effectiveness in about the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ omen@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radioactive marking of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , mark@@ ers was mainly found in the thread ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and those of the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma percentage of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , however , the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent is similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkey match the repeated appointment of Plas@@ ma@@ ine aug@@ mentation with hem@@ atology , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ ici@@ ally growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epi@@ theli@@ um was induced .
in a animal model of family @-@ temper@@ ed poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ oni@@ ds .

the reck@@ oned frac@@ ture incidence was 1,9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 rates per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .

in total , 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin in total , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that suggests that blood sugar levels were similar to as much as other human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients that are possibly excessive ( allergic ) on human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the list of packages ) .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) has reached the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane weigh over the risks associated with diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S an auth@@ orization of the establishment of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ ating effect will be desired with a longer lasting effects .
injection moul@@ ds must be used under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose levels have improved considerably by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin @-@ type ( fast @-@ phase , long @-@ phase insulin . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin delivery ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin of animal origin ) can result in that a change of dosage is required .
if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients an Dos@@ is@@ adaptation is required , this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients , at which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a shift from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
prior to travel , which should go beyond several times of time , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to other times or taken to other times .
the doctor therefore has to consider potential inter@@ actions in the therapy and his patients always ask for other drugs .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ sufficient diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia may lead to consciousness and / or sei@@ zu@@ res , and end with temporary or lasting distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .

hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can however be progres@@ sively developed : • Easy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or glucose food .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grapes , sweets , cookies , or sugar fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with loss of consciousness are treated with a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid person or by glucose that will be intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum torque is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the overall operation time is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is justified in this , that it is a combination of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a range of divisions ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were moved into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites made by the split is active .
based on conventional studies for safety sp@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity at repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , for carcin@@ ogenic potential and to reproductive quality , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize a particular dangers for the human being .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle was taken from the refrigerator - allow the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is used according to the manual for the first use .
some patients , at which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a shift from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who are already able to have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ ask@@ et notes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to larger urine cryst@@ alline , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the u@@ rea @-@ acid can be increased after two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , still sick cases can still occur ; therefore , patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for prevention of arthritis .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , participating in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( p@@ seu@@ do@@ zers ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hypertension ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol has been used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ure@@ th@@ arg@@ inine was at least 6 mg / d@@ l. in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) patients who once daily have a ure@@ th@@ u@@ ge of approximately 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no of 134 patients in the case of placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the conclusion Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the u@@ pro@@ g@@ inal fluid in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly di@@ mming di@@ aci@@ al seal &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were included in each study .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum comp@@ at@@ in@@ ability to study at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed in regard to the lowering of the serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study demonstrated statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ ene di@@ aci@@ di@@ acid value at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintain permanently via the whole treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functional restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney failure ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of serum concentration of the serum concentrations in patients , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations of 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l. .
the data collected in two years of an open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum samples showed that less than 3 % of patients were required in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gre@@ ed no@@ zzle size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ ask@@ et notes per month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long@@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zent@@ aci@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ ential Time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage of serum concentration ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ ma@@ rot@@ ein binding of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed predominantly through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly formed by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ opause , with a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the meal , drink or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company found data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also introduced a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D sp@@ ies .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE were lower ( 11 % ) than those with whom exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate income ( 32 % ) .
the company also indicated data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the digestive apparatus such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ence , diar@@ rhoea ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( blind@@ ed abs ) and sour cherries .
in patients with param@@ et@@ ric hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against ageing , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied .
it may not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .

the following references are considered exactly to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and to decrease adverse events ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed after the day only with full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not swal@@ low the tablet into the mouth as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day , which should take place earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the clinical assessment by the treated doctor is crucial for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefits of risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to assume that they should take a tablet in the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
they should not take two tablets on the same day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the planned week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the or@@ ption of al@@ im@@ ron@@ ate when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interventions studies were not performed , al@@ im@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without the clinical relevant inter@@ actions occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore , neither during pregnancy , to apply to breast@@ feeding women .

Ad@@ jac@@ ke is administered adults with whom a kidneys or liver was transplan@@ ted in order to prevent transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t were presented , with the use of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicators of the efficacy was the number of patients who had been cancelled after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and investigated how Ad@@ vaginal raf is absorbed in the comparison to progra@@ f / programming of the body .
tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mor ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hypertension ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) .
in patients with some hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicine be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ inas , since the Nob@@ le@@ raf dose or the dose of the same drug may be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive Therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ ts , this medication should take place or changes in the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of System@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ t pressure or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; settings of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ igen control of one in the transplan@@ t medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjust@@ ments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of defense and toler@@ ability in the individual and blood level regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations &quot;
after transition from Progra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ inas , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ers should be controlled before the transition and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , System@@ ic exposure , measured as valley mirror , was comparable to kidney disease both in kidney @-@ and @-@ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vaginal raf , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate recovery phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient is not allowed to use drugs in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ l@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of application for the supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t genetic disorders should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
further dose @-@ iz@@ ations can be later necessary , because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may change in the course of stabil@@ isation in the patients after the transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t genetic disorders should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - change@@ over from progra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have a gra@@ ft receiver twice daily intake of progra@@ ph@@ raf . thus , this change@@ over in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) has related to the whole daily dose to take place .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change of other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants on Ad@@ vaginal raf once daily the treatment with each patient must begin in kidney and liver transplan@@ t recommended oral dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft survival .
heart transplan@@ t At adult patients who are inver@@ ted on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , an oral initi@@ ation of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day will take place once a day .
other transplan@@ t cat@@ ers , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ inas at lung cancer , arm@@ ory transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initi@@ ation of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day for use .
Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood supply mirror in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function The kidney function had no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose of dose is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels ) is recommended , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ inas At the transition from a c@@ ic@@ rid por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the Tal@@ bot in full blood . the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of sho@@ cking and toler@@ ability in individual use of solid blood @-@ tac@@ tic tac@@ kling @-@ levels .
it is recommended to carry frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ es of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be tested according to transition from progra@@ m@@ lim@@ us , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive Therapy , or simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vaginal raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , the dose of dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials include that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the levels are not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually occur in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and in transplan@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent detection therapy of liver , kidney , and cardiac transplan@@ t , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft statements , or other side effects , which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; settings of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ m@@ asch@@ igen control of one in the transplan@@ t medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft absorption , proved to be proved by other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants as a re@@ frac@@ tory regim@@ ent , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft patients with adult transplan@@ t recei@@ vers and gra@@ ft recei@@ vers in child @-@ age are not yet clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation Ad@@ vaginal raf .
due to possible inter@@ actions which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ climate change in the blood and a we@@ aker of the clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , is to avoid any other plant effects during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ inas ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered because the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under progra@@ m@@ y@@ opathy was referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sep@@ ia hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which is therefore possible also under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid load and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for Pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision , should be a radical investigation ( e.@@ g .
since Ad@@ vag@@ inas satisfy hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lact@@ ose , patients with a rare her@@ edit@@ ary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption is prescribed .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , the tac@@ kling blood levels in the same gift can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , to monitor and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain the same concentration ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was used with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and fores@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ protein inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly attributable to the elevated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the inhibit@@ ing of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dosed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on how it is used in acute breakdown reactions , increase the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
impact of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ t@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be treated with CY@@ P3@@ A4 due to their metabolism .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ bic@@ eps and thus raise the hormon@@ al ex@@ position , which is particularly careful in decisions concerning the recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and can extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ ts transplan@@ ts provide no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of un@@ wanted events regarding the course and the result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns recommends the harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
it consists of the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the secondary profile of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants often can be found because of the o@@ der@@ ous disease of patients and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of BK Virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leuk@@ ocy@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ inas .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant Ne@@ op@@ last@@ y including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high ties of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its commitment to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the cell within the cell .

in total , the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies showed the observations in the major studies where programming in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents were used to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ t in a intermediate analysis of a recently performed , multi @-@ center study with oral programming has been reported in 110 patients that received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or c@@ ic@@ rid por@@ in .
even a chronic transplan@@ t absorption , the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year amounted to 80@@ ,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ rid group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently given to reaching the reb@@ ate levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ Centr@@ ic study with oral programming as primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an up@@ li@@ gible survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite level , and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the metabolism of the metabolism of the transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabolic before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile .
in stable patients that were included from progra@@ f ( once daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vaginal raf was nearly 10 % lower than under programming .

advances to the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one caused by lack of factor VIII related , con@@ genital blood flow disorder ) is used .
dosage and frequency of the application judge , whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or the prevention of bleeding within surgical procedure .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method produced as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) brought it to the formation of the human being factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is another product approved in the European Union called re@@ bin@@ ate , but it is different , so the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedure .
in the main study , the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood se@@ ams were awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advances must not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII , mouse , or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission informed the Company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for the approval of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the European Union .
dosage Dos@@ age and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy , according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gels , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following h@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity shall not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or in i.e. i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute influence are removed .
injection is repeated every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of patients is over .
during the treatment course it is used to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma concentration .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and feature different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 , of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose , a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out .
the appointment speed should be addressed after the patient &apos;s desire , where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always quanti@@ fied against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 extru@@ sion stage is the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and common inhibit@@ ory development was observed after conversion of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another that is observed ( hum@@ ility ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
in the largest number of patients A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were all in previously untreated patients who have higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected waste of blood cl@@ ots factor VIII in post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post @-@ operative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained during the whole period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma and Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavier to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was found after prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients treated in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors to factor VIII .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicate an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product texts within the study .
7 . as with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency un@@ announced ) .
the activated factor VIII works as a factor for the activ@@ ating factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( factor value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the approval of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be considered a positive rating , but considered positive , but considered that the safety profile should be closely monitored by the following grounds :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company takes its application for the approval of Adv@@ ent by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue , which combines other structures in the body , is surrounded and reli@@ es ) .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that a gene can carry into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus &quot; that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself , and therefore no infection can trigger in man .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow cancer cells to re@@ produce the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Women &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working correctly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company put data from a study of a study involving the Li @-@ Women &apos;s cancer in the field of sub@@ structure , in the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers to the questions posed by the company , some questions were still un@@ explained .
based on the assessment of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s view was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of adv@@ ent in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits benefits for patients .
the committee further concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the form of administration and the security of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment , nor for people who come in contact with the patient , that is harmful .
the company did not deal with the CH@@ MP whether the consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified active ingredients , &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al gr@@ in@@ ous nose ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be recre@@ ated on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measures were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all the hay fever symptoms except the block@@ age of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze income , above a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose has been considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( cardiac in@@ ability ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis ( loss of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders , and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients who are perhaps excessive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for allergies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ function of thy@@ roid ) or have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( cereb@@ ral bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted an auth@@ orization of aer@@ ating Aer@@ in@@ aze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , if whole is to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to bite , to break or cut ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used due to the failure of data for uncertainty and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after def@@ ending the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time for 10 days , since during long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time .
after decl@@ ining the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or in the 2 weeks after the termination of such a therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combination of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ eyel@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ er@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ collective , and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
safety and effectiveness of aer@@ op@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment with occurr@@ ence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ ometer or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of the headache ) must be removed .
for the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with heart rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction of patients with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history , diabetes mell@@ itus , bli@@ sters of brass or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze has at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in case of ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , there were no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences between the patients were detected , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who was still not identified , so the inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate or inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the un@@ question@@ ability of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to human beings , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases there may be a drow@@ sin@@ ess that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic management or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , decreased mental attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ars ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ roph@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth dri@@ es , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human fat cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ ion &apos;s P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose @-@ study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement variables , including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at recommended dose of 5 mg , increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was diagnosed compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause more lik@@ able anom@@ ali@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined based on the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al gr@@ ren@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in relation to the devi@@ ating effect , determined based on the nas@@ al gr@@ ind , was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine above the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose @-@ study to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine reached 10 days .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study conducted with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four test subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly changed .
a components study study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in after the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to an Aer@@ in@@ aze Tabl@@ ette .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ mac@@ ology , for toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , however , clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not recognize any special dangers for the human being .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive treatment studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the oral surgery in rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen .
March 2007 and Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the author@@ isation for author@@ isation for the application of the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the alle@@ vi@@ ating of allergic symptoms by considering that hist@@ amine has its own substance , its effect can develop .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets lenses symptoms that appear in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose , or ju@@ ck@@ ling eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of nose .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 m@@ g. processed tablets ( pill , which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion .
for children in the age of one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml si@@ rup bz@@ w .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml si@@ rup bz@@ w .
A@@ erial was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adult and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the variation of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , com@@ promised sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks treatment was determined .
there were further studies presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the syrup , the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children un@@ imagin@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us on average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) of 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies on Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % treated with placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission informed the Company SP Europe an auth@@ orization of the establishment of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials regarding the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the existing disease and can be resum@@ ed after def@@ ending the symptoms and when rest@@ or@@ ations are resum@@ ed .
the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended for the patient during the allergies .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , using A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol have not been reinforced with the higher effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases there may be drow@@ sin@@ ess that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of per@@ sist@@ ence or ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported on the more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse effects , which were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and were treated with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human fat cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ os@@ ec@@ ül@@ s P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study of multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the N@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 m@@ g. showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as ni@@ o@@ eses , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ vation and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and per@@ si@@ ating allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ zing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as a result of the total scores of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investig@@ ating more forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology has been similar to eti@@ ology at different forms and chronic patients can be simpler and simpler .
since the hist@@ amine is a scientific factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve the symptoms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria in other forms of Ur@@ tica ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidance .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the amount of amount and amount of tor@@ ches at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of a reduction of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable in patients with generic seasonal rhin@@ itis had been comparable , 4 % of patients had higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no connection points for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who was still not identified , so the inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate or inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dos@@ ing of 7.5 mg taken meals ( fet@@ ch , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) not to availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin who showed compar@@ ative degrees of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity at repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may recognize no special dangers for the human being .

A@@ erial may be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data are required to support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es you should play a role in diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is reduced and experienced a higher sub@@ strate load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are limited to metabolic , is identical to the children that are metabolic .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption , or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug may not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found within the clinical studies of A@@ eri@@ us tablets , with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , using A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol have not been reinforced with the higher effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ erial Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ op@@ sis of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged 6 to 11 years ) .
because of the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults to the children population .
in the context of a clinical study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dos@@ ing dose of 45 mg daily ( the N@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was diagnosed compared to placebo .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was not given to the simultaneous taking of alcohol not to an ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced damage to increase the drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and young patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ o@@ eses , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ents and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total scores of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased effectively through seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the amount of amount and amount of tor@@ ches at the end of the first dose .
the spread of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the syrup forms of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are limited to metabolic disorders .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ x higher after 3 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with an additional half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours .
there are no connection points for clin@@ ically relevant active substance Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who was still not identified , so the inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us syrup is offered in type III plastic bottles with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ysty@@ rene measuring sco@@ op , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml , or with a application injection for preparations for inser@@ tion capacity of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once daily place in the mouth to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to the application , the Bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ations to be taken from without damage .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in addition to ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of acc@@ ine that might cause a tribe of influenza , which might cause the future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect .
a influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus , which can easily spread from man to human , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the components of the influenza virus ( flu virus ) as &quot; physically &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will be able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus to this tribe .
the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , recognis@@ es the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , cleans@@ ed , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine does not comply with the requirements of the guidelines on the EMEA for pre @-@ Panam@@ anian vaccines .

for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ general is available as a solution to insert , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ a should then be prescribed then if the doctor has tested the anti@@ viral medication of the patient previously , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood has been judged that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of K@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ reg@@ ase increases after body weight .
A@@ generated is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medication the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , but can cause damage to the immune system , and so that the development of AIDS is related to HIV infections and disease .
A@@ generated was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , but without any rite avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with protagon@@ ists .
the ag@@ itation with low @-@ controlled chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicinal product was used in 206 adult , which had previously taken protagon@@ ists , compared with other protagon@@ ists .
major indicators for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not demon@@ stra@@ ble concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or had had more patients a vir@@ us@@ load of 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ generated was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but of the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ gi@@ ants , were very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ gi@@ ants , this was the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other protagon@@ ists :

the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication treated HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years over against the risks .
A@@ generated is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of A@@ generated in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or is not demonstrated .
A@@ Gener@@ asy was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , since the approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited granted approval for the placing of ag@@ itation in the European Union .
A@@ generated is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ generated capsules are to be used for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ p@@ adding of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o with low doses of K@@ nights ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution can not be re@@ plac@@ eable at a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ itation capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o twice daily with 100 mg of K@@ avi@@ b@@ abo@@ o twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If A@@ general capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of rite avi@@ r ( p@@ adding ) , higher doses to be used to be used ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ itation capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ reg@@ ase in combination with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protagon@@ ists were not examined in children .
gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the failure of data for uncertainty and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day , and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions increased to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ general may not be given simultaneously with medicines containing a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma cent@@ rations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o during the taking of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generated or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not leading to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generated capsules are to be applied together with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver co@@ existence with potentially fatal course .
for the case of con@@ genital anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis @-@ active hepatitis showed a higher frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ general and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which will be confused about CY@@ P3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the anne@@ x function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly recommended by A@@ generic platinum with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ pl@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ rr@@ ien including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of international norm@@ alities ) , are available methods to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who use this medicine simultaneously , A@@ gener@@ a can be less effective for reduced plasma cutting of ammon@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be altered the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ sts , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium traffic symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of k@@ nights .
because of the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene glyco@@ l content of the A@@ generated solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be treated with caution by certain other patient groups .
A@@ generated should be set to 5 , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , has been reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .

in hem@@ ophi@@ lia patients ( Type A and B ) , which have been treated with protein inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual @-@ opport@@ un@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial transaction is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic latitude should not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of ag@@ ro@@ ar must not be coupled with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma cutting with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma protein by dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o can be humili@@ ated by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if one patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ radi@@ al levels and , if possible , examine the vir@@ us@@ load and add the St John &apos;s wort .
Dos@@ is@@ adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( see also E@@ eb@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ de capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o had been prescribed twice daily and K@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and in@@ consistency of this treatment device .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min value of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o in plasma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of K@@ b@@ abo@@ o twice daily ) , when Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ b@@ abo@@ o twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it will be recommended a close surveillance , as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ ability of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ aci@@ dic component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ o in and ag@@ itation are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , during the gift of E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose of dose is required .
the treatment with E@@ mot@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protests would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine on other protests and existing data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may be sun@@ k the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o possibly sun@@ k .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced and potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration .
if this medicine be used together , caution is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision is to be done as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous production of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin has led to a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin in order to increase the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is prescribed along with ag@@ reg@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although no clinical data will be submitted .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ag@@ reg@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but may be increased the plasma cutting of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma at 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 % ) compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be used together with ag@@ reg@@ ase , possibly to interaction .
the patients should therefore be toxic to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with gener@@ a .
based on the data of other protagon@@ ists , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ acids will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a , because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with ammon@@ avi@@ r can lead to a dis@@ sem@@ ination of the plasma cutting of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ pine pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ b@@ pin and di@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o , thereby the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug may be increased .
simultaneous taking with ag@@ itation can increase their plasma percentage points considerably and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ current intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of ag@@ reg@@ ase with k@@ avi@@ b@@ abo@@ o is not recommended along with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 are pronounced in the plasma concentration of the same administration .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ration increases the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medication is not recommended using Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o .
it is recommended a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of mirrors , as the plasma or@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased with the same gift of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with oral @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while using the current application of A@@ generated with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma tor@@ rent of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium traffic symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of K@@ nights .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation to adapt like the Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose when Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the same gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties together with A@@ generated is an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the same gift of ag@@ itation ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medication may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us compared to the pregnancy .
in the milk lak@@ esh@@ ed rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r affects people into breast milk .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was given up to the end of the breast@@ plate in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o , showed an decreased increase in 12 body weight .
the further development of income , including Fer@@ tility and reproductive ability was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o .
in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medication were examined .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ general treatment were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely led to treatment failure .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a result of the ad@@ mir@@ y disease .
most of the adverse events are taken from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with protein inhibit@@ ors were not previously treated 1,200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were weigh@@ ted by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study medi@@ ation , and in more than 1 % of patients have occurred , as well as the treatment of laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) with HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ wn fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of breasts and so@@ vi@@ ous fat accumulation ( stal@@ ks ) .
at 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a median duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sp@@ ik@@ es ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .

skin rash were usually slightly until moderately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o had to be broken .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual @-@ opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .

the conclusions concerning relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is advised to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyze results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ yl@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , analysis , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the estimate of activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
companies , distribut@@ ing diagnostic tests tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross @-@ resistant against k@@ avi@@ b@@ abo@@ o , the sensitivity to the din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ ch@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r , but generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and other protagon@@ ists for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ y Resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , with am@@ id@@ av@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , seed avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r / k@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o re@@ tains its activity against some other protagon@@ ists inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early demo@@ lition of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can influence the following treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ generated in combination with k@@ avi@@ b@@ abo@@ o 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , together with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) , and nucle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ing rite cavi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ general , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time adjusted average variable from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ le@@ eve of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ generated is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ generated solution was used to take and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ ated rite at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients in the study included plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data should be considered with the treatment optim@@ isation of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration , the middle duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max is lowered by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous exposure of the resource absorption is affected .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be mounted to a large distribution volume , as well as a mon@@ stro@@ us penetration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o in the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active changes during the dos@@ ing interval during the ste@@ aming concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
it is therefore necessary to ad@@ able the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or solve a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with car@@ ts ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 , and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generated capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generated solution and A@@ generated capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the impact of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment options lead to Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o plas@@ modi@@ al comparable to those who are b@@ lown to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ oma at dos@@ ages , which addressed the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1,200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ oma and carcin@@ oma was not fully resolved and the relevance of these observed effects is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , yiel@@ ded little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse therapy tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromosome aber@@ ration to human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be detected and detected in clinical everyday life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , clinical trials have been observed no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ generated , nor after the end of treatment .
studies for toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate of animals as well as with Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a systemic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly higher ( rabbits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ ro@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ generated capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of rite avi@@ r ( boo@@ p@@ adding ) , higher doses to be used to be used ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ itation capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of international norm@@ alities ) , are available methods to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ generated should be set to 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .

a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it will be recommended a close surveillance , as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ ability of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ mot@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protests would be low .
if this medicine be used together , caution is required ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision is to be done as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is passed together with A@@ general , the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is advised to at least half the recommended dose of 31 although no clinical data will be submitted .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ pine pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ b@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ b@@ pin and di@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o , thereby the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug may be increased .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ current intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
at the same gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties together with A@@ generated is an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o by 22 % or about 22 % .
during pregnancy , this medication may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was given out of ni@@ b@@ ulation in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o , showed an decreased increase in body weight during neg@@ ligence .
in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medication were examined .
in case of transi@@ tions , the patient is observed at signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µm with infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o re@@ tains its activity against some other protagon@@ ists inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , treatment optim@@ isation should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children who are expected to be expected .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active changes during the dos@@ ing interval during the ste@@ aming concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
it is therefore necessary to ad@@ able the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or solve a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with car@@ ts ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 , and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ oma at dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to people daily from 1,200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o .
the under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ular Aden@@ omas and Kar@@ cin@@ ome was not yet confirmed and the relevance of these observed effects is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , had little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse therapy tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromosome aber@@ ration to human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate of animals as well as with Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r animals .
these results indicate that the metabolism of the metabolism are not fully equipped , so Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution can not be re@@ plac@@ eable at a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , using the solution to interv@@ ene ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ itation solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous application of ag@@ reg@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion and low @-@ dose ch@@ avi@@ r can be avoided that combination with these patient groups can be avoided .
although an Dos@@ is@@ ance for Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o is not needed for am@@ id@@ av@@ b@@ r , an application of A@@ generated solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glyco@@ l content is A@@ generated solution for induc@@ ing infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a peti@@ tive inhibit@@ ing of this drug and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generated or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not leading to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of 47 of an transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .

on the basis of the data to 54 other CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am was significantly higher than an oral surgery in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for people is not well @-@ known . A@@ generated solution for inser@@ tion may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lak@@ esh@@ ed rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r affects people into breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was given up to the end of the breast@@ plate in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o , showed an decreased increase in 55 body weight .
in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medication were examined .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a result of the ad@@ mir@@ y disease .

the applic@@ ability and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on treating the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a up to a maximum of 16 weeks per week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , it is up to a week for six weeks , during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks pause between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is to be dil@@ uted before bed@@ time on the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain sufficient ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to placebo ( same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
major indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete elimination of care . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated six weeks or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
major indicators for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In all four basic studies , 15 % to 52 % treated with patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a were treated . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a total reduction ratio of 66 % to 80 % associated with Al@@ dar@@ a patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application site of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is so long to continue until all visible threads in the genital or peri@@ anal area disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the treatment described above should be wo@@ ging if intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if there is an infection in the treatment area .
if in follow up after 4 to 8 weeks after the second course of treatment the les@@ ions were only in@@ complete , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should carry out the cream as soon as he noticed / her , and then continue with the usual treatment plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and dri@@ fting in a thin layer with f@@ eig@@ ns infected skin area until the cream is completely covered .

it should be carried out in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and with a possible organ bum@@ ps or Gra@@ ft @-@ vs @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ auth@@ orization was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a circumcision are observed .
in a application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , an elevated risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed severe local skin irrit@@ ation that require a treatment necessary and / or to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions appeared at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the water , which necess@@ itate an accident cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
in connection to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous use of applic@@ ated funds for the treatment of external threads in the genital and peri@@ anal area , there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicates an increased rate of incl@@ ine reductions on HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of f@@ eig@@ ns , however , lower effectiveness .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ dressing kit was not examined .
local front actions are common , but the intensity of these reactions take place in general during the therapy or reactions to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the symptoms of the patient or because of the sever@@ ity of local service actions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after the re@@ positioning of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available , with super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , other suitable treatments should be moved into consideration .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , clinical experiences are not recommended , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that at large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of the response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip @-@ area inside the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ic places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis in arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local front actions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reaction to the patient may cause great dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be exposed to a few days .
data from an open clinical study assumes that patients with more than 8 acts - a less@@ er complete healing rate referred to as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
because of the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be used with caution for patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
in animal studies , no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ red@@ ale development , the removal or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after even after one @-@ time top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most frequently included and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to adverse events in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the place of the treatment of f@@ eig@@ ns ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine patients ) .
the most frequently reported and considered probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context @-@ standing side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 2@@ 8.1 % .
the study of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme fra@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , considered probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme in the context of these studies were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine patients ) .
the side effects that were listed by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies in phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
according to test plan , evaluation of clinical signs indicate that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ tr@@ ori@@ ation / exhaust ( 23 % ) and oils ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to the assessment of the clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe damage and reduction ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment location or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ significant one @-@ off intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gi@@ as and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination following the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected .
in 3 appro@@ vals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete exc@@ itation of the f@@ eig@@ n treatment in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treatment is far superior to placebo @-@ treatment .
in a total of 60 % of the total of 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients suffering from the flow of fat ; this was with 20 % of the 105 treated patients with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete press release could be achieved in 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times per week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od near three times a week in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discreet , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within an related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ comfortable scal@@ p or face .
the results from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indicator out@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients generally not up and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum systematic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aling 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application of the face ( 25 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was low in patients at the age of 6 - 12 years , and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ pants or super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of paint toxic@@ ity in rat @-@ rat , cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a study performed for four months in the mouse that had no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year trial for carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during three days per week induced no tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only one low systemic absorption from the human skin and does not mut@@ ate , is a risk for people due to the systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the mice group treated with the effective free cream , previously used in a larger number than in the control group with less U@@ C .
it can damage other people as well , even if these same symptoms have hurt you like you . − When one of those listed side effects may significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice effects that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

in the study mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( with regard to reducing the concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , pain pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react sensi@@ tively to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is updated every year all new information that may be known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who keep Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me concerning reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval for the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. offering auth@@ orization of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative of the long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ d@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial index rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient is wearing it , increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions that are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be supervised , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are to form against lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment commen@@ ce .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break @-@ up , due to the theoretical risk provisions , a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ her@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a light or medium @-@ in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused by means of anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
in@@ fusion is used to reduce the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
animal experiments do not allow to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended to breast@@ feeding during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
clinical trials in clinical trials were mainly used as in@@ fusion reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the phase 3 study and an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently listed in the following chart : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the history there were also severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breath@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted pharmac@@ euticals in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe failure and treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment with a server version , with a severe failure rate mostly within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or until an early retirement from the study ) were found in 13 / 45 patients without a radio@@ immune response ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients , with which it had never been at the server version .
patients with lack of low @-@ antibody levels referred to a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror , while in patients with high antibodies , a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutral @-@ level effect on the enzy@@ matic physical activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed un@@ wanted in connection with the incidence of undes@@ i@@ red drug transactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ i@@ red drug reaction typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ ho@@ os@@ omes , the most likely above Mann@@ i @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients ( age 6 to 43 ) .
although patients were recruited for the study identified the whole disease spectrum , the majority of patients had the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient found the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited as they were recruited by less than 80 % of the expected value ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value ; and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 metres .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute line in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with improved lung function and the in@@ ability to be shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ yst@@ anders before treatment amounted to 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of g@@ ag levels in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ inine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease , between the patients who were combined with the use of a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , had no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a year @-@ old phase 2 study was performed in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years ( 16 patients with severe decline in form and 4 in middle course form ) .
in four patients the dose of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined according to the Z Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with middle course form indicate a normal mental development speed , while in the older patients with severe failure form just limited or no progress in cog@@ nitive development .
in a phase 4 study tests on pharmac@@ o@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing scheme from various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing scheme on the g@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test were carried out .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the Do@@ si@@ der@@ sch@@ ema with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may have patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fusion . however , it is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing scheme is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will assess any new information that will be available , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies for safety sp@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data do not recognize a special dangers for the human being .
since no toler@@ ability studies were performed , this drug may not be mixed with other drugs , except those listed below 6.@@ 6th .

within the given time , the propriet@@ or of the approval for the placing of the study has given the following programme programme to form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit risk relationship .
this register will be treated in longer term security and efficacy @-@ related information that have been treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data to the natural pro@@ g@@ ence of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ ph@@ s ) , either in low quantity before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
in use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other drugs . please inform your doctor if you are using medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken any other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
hin@@ ts for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate on the use of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before the application and is provided for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical specialists ) .
initial In@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient is we@@ ars that , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS iso @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in previous history , however , serious reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory , and facial oils .
very frequent ( occurr@@ ence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash or joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • drow@@ ning pulse • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion unit
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information available , rate per year , and if necessary , the packing unit will be updated .
if the ready @-@ ready @-@ ready preparation is not immediately used , this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , unless the di@@ lution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions were carried out .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e after body weight of the individual patients initially determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent turn@@ able bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) if the cancer is not re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble &quot; ( malign@@ ant cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not gr@@ asp the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who were not treated before , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously had already received other chem@@ o@@ therapies that have previously applied to several therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients with A@@ lim@@ ta should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ eal medicine &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes , or any other side effects occur , treatment should be set up , set down or reduced the dose .
thus , the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ig@@ ning Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ el@@ oma A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer were the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug versus cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( other medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients in which cancer were not attack epi@@ theli@@ al cells , when A@@ lim@@ ta caused longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the Company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. offering auth@@ orization of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each side bottle has to be saved with 4,2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ sh@@ ism is taken from the bottle , and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , in the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for outstanding drive epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed gift and the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , at least 5 doses have to be fo@@ lic acid , and the intake must be continued during the period of therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third beam cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ got@@ ic count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held by the no@@ d@@ rs of blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predi@@ ge@@ - h@@ ending treatment cycles .
according to the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 blood .
should patients develop non @-@ adh@@ es@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 ( except ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy should be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient remains the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ ing products , an ha@@ em@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity is 3 or 4 or 4 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over , in comparison to patients aged 65 years , an increase of adverse events .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to un@@ sufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need dose adjust@@ ments needed to go beyond for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations .
data in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver failure of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - boundary value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically studied in studies .
patients must be monitored in relation to the Kno@@ ef@@ mark@@ eters and must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ per has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te result has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ rop@@ en@@ code , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was recommended if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ treated patients must be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ lac@@ tic measure on reducing toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous taking of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ ic ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ ful of 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ term therapy for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occur , appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre@@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection in the trans@@ cellular space , there should be a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed live vaccine ( excluding yel@@ low@@ fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive ability exists through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted to obtain advice on sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) resulted in a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ separation with the result of increased occurr@@ ence of side effects .
therefore caution applies if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) contains high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ ful of 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the ac@@ tionary potential as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed during pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected during an application during pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful cleaning of the farm for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive ability exists through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice on the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vi@@ e- lock@@ out .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to breast milk and un@@ wanted effects when embroi@@ dered acid can not be excluded .

patients who take all@@ i can take no weight loss after 12 weeks , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t disman@@ tle some fats in the food , thereby resulting in the food for about a quarter of the fats .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who have 60 m@@ g. a year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , patients could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) o@@ ily spots on after , fli@@ atus ( winds ) with bo@@ wel movements , chair rang , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , finish oils ( tor@@ ches ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .

the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurr@@ ence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat burning meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes with an improved metabolic control could be , patients who should consult a drug against diabetes before the start of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic may be adapted .
patients , all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage should be adapted to this drug .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ation periods in order to prevent any failure of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tions in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study to inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ rid por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ rid is observed .

most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standard area .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time , a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement must be taken to ensure adequate vit@@ amin@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers that simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and related with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine , as absorption of taken fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the skins are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
the prevalence of certain side effects , which were noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ wanted size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i to convert all@@ i in terms of possible and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects can lead .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ level doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without being significant clinical findings .
during the majority of reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ ation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on examinations on human and animal , the effects on human and animal may be derived from a fast revers@@ ing of systemic effects that are attributable to or@@ list@@ at &apos;s properties .
the therapeutic effect is set up in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper fertilizer , by co@@ al@@ ente ties to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and Panam@@ anian Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived from clinical trials that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fatty acids .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 , prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fatty fish produced diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss in the first 6 months occurred .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied to chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemical therapies ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic treatment ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information .
this means that the substance means the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chemical therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi alone showed no vomiting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared with 57 % associated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemical therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi alone showed no vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission informed the Company of Helsinki , Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , an auth@@ orization of bringing alo@@ xi funds across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced through a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on tape , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able with the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or which tend to have an extension .
in connection with a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic gift , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy , nor to prevent any treatment of nausea and vomiting .
in clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ inhi@@ bited the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ am @-@ stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds of an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous production of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , i@@ ini@@ dine , ser@@ ap@@ al@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is considered as needed by the treatment doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse reactions were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly stood by Alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ stac@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar sk@@ ies of adverse events appeared in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted because of the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment with a Alo@@ xi@@ - exagger@@ ation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on day 1 without a dex@@ am@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ous .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ te that were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of trials with moderately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy have been sum@@ med up in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the effects of On@@ dan@@ lla and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of the clinical investigation , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved ion@@ ic channels and extend the duration of the action point .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows a initial decrease in Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zent@@ or@@ ations a slow Eli@@ min@@ ation from the body with an average season half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the total dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 m / kg in soci@@ ally and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 high @-@ cell carcin@@ oma ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations that at once daily , intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reaches a value of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated from the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron beyond less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ ised have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made as un@@ changeable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ one intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ine projection at the heart of the whole body , the full @-@ body levels was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function disorders , the termin@@ ale elimination period and the average systematic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but reducing the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient on the maximum of human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a small relevance to clinical use .
10 . clinical trials are indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels only in very high concentrations of ion channels that can extend at the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ sis ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , or@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the used high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi for unique use is determined , the relevance of these results is minimal .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Immun@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the failure of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should res@@ emble a biological medicinal product called R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A with the same arz@@ t@@ ably effective element that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ called ) hepatitis C ( a virus infection caused by a virus infection ) .
a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast to stimul@@ ate a gene ( DNA ) to stimul@@ ate this to the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon laid data on the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and effectiveness in Hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate of 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adju@@ sting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business , only the EMEA is . what were the greatest concerns caused by the CH@@ MP to disp@@ ose the approval for placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns were indicated that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the market@@ able drugs .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial .
after adju@@ sting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant with more patients than with the reference agent ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was used in the study to investigate the question , in which the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it may be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ust @-@ running skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ab@@ ated ) , sc@@ ut@@ ations and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , demon@@ stra@@ bly , or presumably by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go does not affect this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the treatment area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not addressing the treatment for two to three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient and draw alternative treatments in consideration .
it works through blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
major indicators of the effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was removed after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated to placebo .
in the treatment of infected ho@@ unds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates showed : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were addressed to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused by treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( vanity cases in body tissues ) or infections , which have been prov@@ oked or probably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation in the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections caused by the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , sc@@ ents or pal@@ sy wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . an auth@@ orization of the establishment of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients , with which there is no improvement in two to three days , should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tis@@ ation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is abol@@ ished , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully detect and an adequate alternative therapy of infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infection where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary un@@ infected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plasma percentage , which have been achieved when humans have been achieved for top@@ ical use of skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 For the current gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the minor system exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required if top@@ ical retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive treatments and are inadequate regarding a statement of effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be only applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear , and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be prefer@@ able to an systemic antibiotic .
at the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / finished or terminated with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is between the use of breast@@ feeding for inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported adverse effect on the administration , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode of mode retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from the fermentation of cl@@ it@@ och@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding station of the 50s sub@@ division of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the obligations of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
the data indicates that the association of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ic protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bonds and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
by binding on this binding , P@@ el@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line transfer the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ic sub@@ units .
should be based on the basis of the local pre@@ valent resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some Inf@@ ection forms , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was charged with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary in@@ infected wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic up@@ take of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro review on genetic mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kern@@ test for in @-@ vi@@ vo test chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fer@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to the people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) :
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats the oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development of development ( decl@@ ining weight of fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) were detected .

am@@ id@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( illnesses that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
the Ambi@@ rix is applied to an existing vaccine , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only allowed if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the existing vaccine can be taken at the end of two doses .
if a refresh@@ ment dose against hepatitis A or B is required , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vaccines have &quot; contribute to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense system ) , &quot; as it can fight against illness .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and who has been approved in 1997 for Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same illnesses , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given an existing vaccine .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data used to support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicators for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibody after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
am@@ nesty conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix looks like a sixth and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , redness , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
am@@ id@@ rix may not react sensi@@ tively to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ í@@ s.@@ a. an auth@@ orization of the surrounding area of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic base with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccine doses , whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refresh@@ er is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccine or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ LW ) virus and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size , according to the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccine .
it is not fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ous individuals who have addressed a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination is a protective chim@@ ney as protection , as it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory as well .
3 As with all injection substances , the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction should be immediately available after the gift of the vaccine appropriate options of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ v@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody being achieved so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration may result in a sub@@ optimal pulse result , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , am@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders can be inj@@ ected , however , am@@ using sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions , as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza virus ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - Mum@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ tle vaccine was given , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ eness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable with the frequency , which was observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ e- and preser@@ vative in@@ oc@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and activity on a comp@@ uted basis per vaccine ambient am@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ utation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects as a result of a dose of 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine .
according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had gotten am@@ bus@@ h@@ ings had been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ ness was similar ( i.e. about the whole vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects who received am@@ us@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with a 3 @-@ cans in@@ oc@@ sch@@ ema .
in a comparison study of 1 @-@ 11 year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurr@@ ence of local reaction and general reactions were comparable to the am@@ bition associated with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine with a 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , after the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a little more common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reports .
the proportion of vaccines that have caused serious side effects during the 2 doses of vacc@@ inations , with am@@ bition or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not different .
in clinical trials involving vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years were the serum @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 ab@@ ort dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , there were 142 two doses ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined fuel with three doses .
at 289 people whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was compens@@ ated , the serum samples ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with the am@@ id@@ st of the 3 @-@ dose of hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose .
the immune response , which have been reached in a clinical comparison study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds within a month after the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ cans in@@ oc@@ sch@@ ema with am@@ am@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for individuals who were at the time of the basic idea between 12 and 15 years , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with am@@ at@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination .
the immun@@ al reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the vaccine of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination up@@ side to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year is at the same time the dri@@ pping of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ac , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ us@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated Poli@@ omyel@@ itis ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence as well as for the former formulation .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food@@ stuffs and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as swimming in the waters de@@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , am@@ bus@@ rix cannot fully protect against an infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child will not feel un@@ comfortable or sick / feel at the time of the vaccination ) , an in@@ oc@@ ulation cannot prevent a disease .
any protection against other infections caused by the liver , or cause symptoms that are similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If your child once showed an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or some part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be utter@@ ed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the recommended administration of the second vaccination ) .
a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination is given to you / your child from an in@@ oc@@ ulation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine will be administered with reduced content of effective content , usually a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against the vaccination series before termination of the vaccination .
sometimes , am@@ id@@ rix are inj@@ ected with severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / its own immune system / is / or if you / your child under@@ go to a hem@@ aly@@ sis / or under@@ go .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on the vaccination .
21 . ask your doctor if you are taking your child further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / has been given / has been given or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) is planned / has been planned in the near future .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix are at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be enough .
it is usually not given to be pregnant or lact@@ ating women , except it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated for hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have seen an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second in@@ oc@@ ulation , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and available in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP agreed that the benefit of the benefit ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , da am@@ rix are only limited in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to the low patient position .
am@@ mon@@ aps may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defective or hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ moni@@ tions ) in history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is divided into several single doses of meals - swallowed by food or over a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nose probe ( with the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a hypo@@ thal@@ ate medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps may also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid effects , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ comfortable body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps prevented in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle to high am@@ moni@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the disease of the disease only limited information on this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme deficiency already in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ party form ( in@@ complete enzyme defective , which is manifest after the first life of life ) , an indication of the use when in the history a hyper@@ sp@@ aci@@ al en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ ges , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with gor@@ cking disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not able to get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) containing sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and o@@ ede@@ tion in clinical states only with caution .
as a metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat takes place over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with external caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
during the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ ons and resulted in a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted if Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is out of the human breast in the breast milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS was contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ i@@ rable event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ alist patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ose tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with a healthy single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which showed dos@@ is@@ tive neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene is compar@@ atively similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis was granted early and treatment immediately , to improve survival for survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest symptoms of the disease with occurr@@ ence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alog@@ a within the first year of life .
due to ha@@ v@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , proteins reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed with 80 % .
in patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate came with many to many mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ o@@ gene@@ ous form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ter@@ ato@@ cy@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and reduced diet permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a diet reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
even existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurological condition occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were treated according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in sober @-@ related healthy adults , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to individual charges and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma percentage ( phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) were detected .
in the majority of patients with u@@ rea fatigue or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opathy was det@@ ectable after various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic in plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma concentration were five times higher than the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated production phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects in rats no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral , infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with gor@@ cking disorders ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a no@@ stri@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) containing sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat nec@@ essi@@ ties were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active Met@@ abolic lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came into les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the c@@ ort@@ ex .
an likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ alist patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ose tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene is compar@@ atively similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight
on the basis of research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat produces between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurological condition occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentrations were detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this case the small measuring sco@@ op 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must have received the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver preparations are missing , so they can not ex@@ termin@@ ate the sti@@ cky waste products , which can accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body .
when using laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation time you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could go over to breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , flav@@ ours , reverse the hearing , dis@@ orient@@ ates , memory defic@@ its and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms at oneself , please contact your doctor or contact your hospital emer@@ gen@@ cies in the introduction of a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of blood images ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , un@@ comfortable skin rash , rash , kidney dys@@ functions , weight gain and abnormal laboratories .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists when one of those listed side effects may significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after switching on the box and the extent of &quot; usable up to &quot; given exp@@ iry date no longer .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS look and contents of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If there are laboratory studies , you need to notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed in same single doses or via a stomach fe@@ eb@@ le ( hose , runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring sco@@ op Gran@@ ules . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a measuring reed above the edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ op Gran@@ ules from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an abnormal measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI is administered a higher dose and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after surgery .
this can contribute in patients with ang@@ ina or pal@@ ms to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared with the conventional combination of h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I compared .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - during the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go a PCI was angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ ine , except for serious bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent ( allergic ) or any of the other components .
it must not be applied in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that angi@@ ox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a mid@@ able replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . an auth@@ orization of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) is scheduled for emergency access or if early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in further sequence a PCI should be given , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
directly before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage for angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is comprised of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be done .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence lower ACT values , the constitutional and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the Bol@@ us@@ dosage rapidly intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , the one PCI is treated ( whether using Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in versus ACS or not ) , a lower incidence rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is 225 mg / kg , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is to be dis@@ ma@@ yed and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney disease , which included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which included for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox takes 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous gift of untreated h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular h@@ ep@@ arin .
• more known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other hem@@ or@@ aneous hem@@ or@@ aneous hem@@ or@@ aneous hem@@ or@@ aneous hem@@ ophi@@ lia . • severe kidney disease and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored in relation to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most ble@@ edings on arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle of bleeding .
in patients who are using War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be considered to be a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( international norm@@ alised ratio ) to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine reaches the treatment existing prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge of an anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ated sh@@ em@@ mer ) , this active ingredients may be increased .
in any case the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in aggreg@@ ated aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ cip@@ es are the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ st@@ as@@ ep@@ ar@@ ameter in any case regularly .
the experimental tests are inadequate regarding the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , inadequate or post@@ nat@@ al development in@@ sufficient ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either untreated Hep@@ ar@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the comparison groups associated with h@@ ep@@ arin , there were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes , requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or is administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot produce sufficient insulin control of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or process the insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs a very low level of human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter mode has more than a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effectively in the body , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicators for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at insulin l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % compared to six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human level insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) against insulin injec@@ tions or any of the other components , or in patients who suffer from a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the Company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the establishment of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glucose monitoring capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin injec@@ tions , the insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be dimin@@ ished .
any change of the active force , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand .
3 A inadequate dosage or treatment of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin paid diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life threatening .
adjustment of one patient on another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active account of the insulin @-@ related insulin profile and can therefore change to transformation of the treatment scheme .
to the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , s@@ ali@@ per@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , the symptoms of symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as frau@@ dul@@ ous , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ ves can be weak@@ ened or absent from the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ f@@ ences .
animal experiments on Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is unknown whether the insulin injec@@ tors are exagger@@ ated in human breast milk but generally , insulin does not occur in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ised to oral application .
in the following , the clinical trials listed in clinical trials are listed , group@@ ed by system organs and are frequent : ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Will fails to altern@@ ate the injection of injec@@ tions within the injection range , in a row a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be treated using a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an equivalent person , or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a physician .
after a glu@@ ed projection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital in order to determine the cause of cause severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( in particular by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the mode of operation is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ations showed a dose of proportional glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 A / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose tolerance effect , precisely as human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effici@@ encies , such as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose tolerance effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clearly stated that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was gro@@ unded , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was given as a human normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control like in human normal insulin is given ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin l@@ ul@@ ant in the gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the meal has been given in comparison to human level , 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human level , 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
after the beginning of the meal , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ eth was given at the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
