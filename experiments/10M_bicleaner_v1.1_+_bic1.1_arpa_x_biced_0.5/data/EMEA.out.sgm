<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Financial Report Report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Humanarztant (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or their treatment, please read the pack of packing (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Acres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madments; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients lack a normal mood (periods of abnormal high-spirit) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abollify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased agitation or behavioral disorders when the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablets in patients, which make the swallow of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are using other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in smaller measurements than the neurotransmitter affects to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin brings a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reduces psychotic or manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, which prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were compared to placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperiidol in another study, to prevent the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in a different study compared to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectionists was enrolled in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours compared.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body readily absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intervene (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented us up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abollify injections decreased in 10- or 15-mg doses also effective as placebo perceived their symptoms of restlessness and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (constant motion), tumulence (constipation), tumble hypersecretion (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The conclusion that led to the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes in the treatment of schizophrenia and from the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injectionists in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manian episodes in Bipolar-I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission approved the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an authorization of the establishment of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate to serious episal episodes of Bipolar-I- disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients, mainly manic episodes, and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justifiable (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithmetic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviours belong to mental disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or following an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder does not have increased suiciality risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be treated with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotension (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskies: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazole Dyskluft</seg>
<seg id="39">If treated with ABILIFY, patients who occur signs and symptoms of a late dynasty should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms that indicate a mns or impaired high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be deposited, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, Aripiprazole in patients with seizures in the history of seizures or states that are related with seizures in relation to caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients associated with psychoses that were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of those studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for undesirable vascular events treated with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">In general, a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is observed and an unhealthy lifeline is observed and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system is caution, when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with outlay side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resignation of Aripiprazole, however, this effect is regarded as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers an effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common use of high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations arise from Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should exceed potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteashibitors, must have similar effects, and therefore, similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose of absorbing therapy before the start of the companion.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or CYP2D6, together with ABILIFY, can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazene) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data security to humans and due to the concerns of reproductive studies in the animal studies, this medication may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against them, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parathsonism, acathisie, Dystony and Dyskinthia, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperiidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was placebo in patients with Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In a different long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from Haloperiidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were detected, did not mean medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipraole patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskies and seizures, adverse mortality of dementia cases, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberated overdosies were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemoglizole in treatment with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that havalysis is in the treatment of an overflow of benefits, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole with schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disorder has the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine di4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergen and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">During the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dosing-dependent reduction of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudus and at the plum.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week, 52 of the proportion of the responsibilities of patients who have a response to study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperiidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement aspects, defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperiidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks on stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was below 34% in the Aripitiole Group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ovlanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks of patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole demonstrated a placebo-superior effectiveness in the reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monootherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripitizole over to placebo no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manian or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole demonstrated a placebo effect in week 3 and a maintenance effect, which was comparable to the lithium or Haloperiidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also proved a comparative share of patients with symptomatic remission in the mania, such as lithium or Haloperiidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manian or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without mental characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks did not appear on lithium or Valproat-monotherapy at therapeutic Serpole. compared to monopoly symptoms in comparison to Monotherapy, with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion in certain patients that had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation, Aripiprazole showed up to placebo particularly in terms of prevention of a bipolar withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the CYP2D6 enzymes and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyde hydroxyzole by CYP3A4 by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminationshalbwerage is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolism about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients had no sexually dependant effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of a smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic features of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripipraole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, reproductive-toxicity, genotoxicity and the candious potential to detect the preceptive data for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects remotest a dosisperant-niotic diseases (AUC) with rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 times the average maximum dose of cancer) and an increase of non-nib carcinoma and carcinoma at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times the medium-sized steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">There was also Cholelioxic as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjugate of hydroxyzole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral surgery from 25 to 125 mg / kg (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg in the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no longer than 6% of concentrations found in the study were found in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold in the medium-scale Steam State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of the hypersensitivity interaction is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli-drug that promotes merging the microtubules from the Tubular indigenes and stabilized the microtubules by inhibiting their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibit of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the Transcytosis of plasmacomcomponents in the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this enhanced transendocking transport is mediated by the gp-60-Albuminogen receptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (opted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the range of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two catardy-blind studies and 454 patients who were randomised in a randomized Phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane which was given in form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for abortion on Baseline, due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of total-paclitaxel according to 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The effect position (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 In the recommended clinical dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel-Plasmaconenta has increased to a multi-phase modulation.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extravascular distribution and / or crossover network of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients suffering from late solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of soluble paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) than according to a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that paclitaxel is primarily reduced to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3 "-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was 4% of the given total dose of less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a vast non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed up a biological medicinal product is similar, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and the same ingredient (also called "reference agent").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood ferencing factors which occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed has to be led under the supervision of a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be done by the patient or their caregimentson, provided they have received a reasonable manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decay in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The Iron values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency consists of iron weight, and iron supplement should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems can cause anemia caused by a erythropoetine deficiency or by means that the body does not suffice to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of epoxettin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was placed as an injection into a Vene in the context of a major study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, compared to the reference agent.</seg>
<seg id="370">All of the patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a Vene, before they were either placed on sevending or remain Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Major indicators for the effectiveness was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25-29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company reported the results of a study in which the effects were examined by the skin injected abortions with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients who suffer from kidney problems caused Anemia, the haemoglobin values of patients who were placed on abseamed were obtained in the same degree as for those patients who continue to keep Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In contrast, patients who continue to keep Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure which may occasionally cause symptom of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, side-violent headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Sevending may not be applied in patients that are possibly excessive (allergic) against epoxettin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that these are caused by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) has reached the conclusion that the medicine has been achieved for abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which abuses abseamed, is informational for medical specialists in all Member States information, including information about the security of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="386">Bacterial symptoms and folklets can vary depending on the age, gender and total disease of disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease insurrection is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobins in order to avoid more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients may occasionally be observed in an patients individual haemoglobin above or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobbinvariability the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) can be reached by 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxettin-alfa dose is increased by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">The patients should be supervised to ensure that epoxetalfa is in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anemia and anesthetic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance outlets than patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance outlets than patients where the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">The patients should be supervised to ensure that epoxetalfa is in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of mitigation symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the vertical intake increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 kg / kg should be maintained three times per week or 450 people / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the vertical intake of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 i.e. / kg three times per week.</seg>

<seg id="401">However, the haemoglobite value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the vertical intake increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoxettin-alfa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33-39%), with which the pre-caring deposits of ≥ 4 blood-conservative should be required, abseamed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>

<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip-correction should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) oral or injection in a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen (means against inflammation) just after the application of Aclasta can result in the three days after infusion symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>

<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8 000 older women were involved with osteoporosis and it was investigated the number of vertebrates and hips over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study involved 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years which had been recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures were examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicators for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that builds a bone substance) in the blood once again normalized or reduced by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study involving older women the risk of vertebrates in patients under Aclasta (without any Osteoporosis accounts) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70%.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison of all patients under Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis) the risk of hips was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving males and women with hip-correction 9% of patients under Aclasta had a questionnaire (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients with placebo (139 from 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients that are possibly excessive (allergic) against Zoledronylic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As in all Bisphosphonates, patients in Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteodeficiency (extinction of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>

<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronylic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In combination with the combined results, a similar decrease in the pain relief and pain relief was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified at the end of the six months main study on the therapy were classified (on the therapy), could be taken into an obituary phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Patients who took part in the follow-up study was 141 of the patients who attended the follow-up study compared with 71 members of patients treated with Risedron, compared with 71 who were treated with craedronate in the middle duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes persevering infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronylic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma torch increased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase, no more than 0,1% of the maximum value.</seg>

<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent quick absorption in the bones and excretion of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the prescribed dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent from the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">Extension of the infusion-time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledronylic acid is not metabolic because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, non-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patients (see section 4.2) of the Zoledronylic acid correlated with the creatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and at the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney disorder until down to a creatinine-Clearance until 35 ml / min does not require Dosission of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Due to severe kidney disorder (creatinable Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs were single doses ranging from 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was determined with intravenous dose of Zoledronylic acid in 3 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to 6 times in 3 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of the human therapeutic exposure referred to the AUC, corresponding to AUC).</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Services Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanarztant (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can't be used in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a cancer medicine) can be applied together with other cancer medicine (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl harnant or insulin, the previous dose of sulphonylharnal or insulin can be preserved with the onset of acetylemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonylharnal or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized better and the blood sugar level is reducing, enabling type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetate was studied in Tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl harnant, in addition they received either acetone or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glyceral hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of the addition to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylharnant showed a 0.94% reduction, while the additional cure from placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of acetone and insulin were examined at 289 patients, the patients who received acetone in addition to insulin, a decrease in the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to stimulants).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acting must not react in patients, which may react sensitively to pioglitazone or one of the other components, even with patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirror - acidration).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (in the sole use) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white till whitish, round, arched and wear on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "ACTOS." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and with which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility is not suitable (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiac Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in heart failure showed, however, which led not to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of the liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are the liver-enzymatic values as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient developed symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymatic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone continued to be continued, should be led to the presence of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, dosing-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be stirring by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematology, under the therapy with pioglitazone, a slight reduction in intermediate haemoglobon (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits in patients under sulfonylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two-way combination therapy with a sulfonylharnstoff or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment of thiazolidindions, including pioglitazon, has been reported on an occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular demic.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but a ordnative doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular dems if patients may report on disturbances of vision; a suitable ophthalmic severance should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesired events in terms of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials have been treated with more than 8,100 patients with pioglitazone for a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="782">The reckoned fracture incidence was 1,9 questionnaires per 100 patient-years treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years with women who were treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fraktures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 rates per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or that occurs, the treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the examination of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, Phenomenoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines referred to by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, Cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductasinhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazone by the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a lowering of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazone that reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for ficially growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequent &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbulence and the reindexes of the lens, such as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege occurred over three times the upper limit of the norm range, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of a heavy heart failure was 1.6% higher than with placebo when Pioglitazon bzw were more than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch market has rarely been reported on heart failure in Pioglitazon, but more frequently if Pioglitazone in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure was used.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of messages undesired events in randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative surgical groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PROACTIVE study, Fraktures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day after seven days have no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to act on activating specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferative recurring receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose consumption in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the period until leaving the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of patients (compared with 50% of patients receiving Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin exposure, to Pioglitazone or placebo were randomized.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone reduced the middle HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared with the patients who continue to have insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in which was treated with pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinine-quota compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small, dated 18 weeks analysis of type 2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and marginally, but clinical not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, total plastic glycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels while metformin and Gliclazid was observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postponents of triglyceride levels, both with effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE trial, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised to receive an existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is readily absorbs, with the top concentrations in fixed pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, M-IV's contribution to its effectiveness in about the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, Phenomenoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marking of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, markers was mainly found in the thread (55%) and a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and those of the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma percentage of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, however, the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkey match the repeated appointment of Plasmaine augmentation with hematology, anaemia and reversible heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazone that reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for ficially growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of the urinary epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-tempered polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions resulted in an increased frequency of colonids.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fraktures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 rates per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with each Pioglitazone or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinine-quota compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postponed triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the tryglerid absorption, and also on the hepatic Tryglicense-synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the objective of their primary endpoint, such a combination of the overall mortal, non-lethal coronary syndrome, stroke amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, put results near that with the intake of Pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk risks associated with the intake of pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of Systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant pressure or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; settings of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the engmaschigen control of one in the transplant medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of defense and tolerability in the individual and blood level regulations (see below "recommendations"</seg>
<seg id="1415">After transition from Prograf on Advaginas, the Tacrolimus-Talers should be controlled before the transition and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, Systemic exposure, measured as valley mirror, was comparable to kidney disease both in kidney-and-transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus-tales are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advaginal raf, to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate recovery phase.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function The kidney function had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose of dose is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum levels) is recommended, a calculation of the creatinine and monitoring of the urinary volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin on Advaginas At the transition from a cicrid porin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is required (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the Talbot in full blood. the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of shocking and tolerability in individual use of solid blood-tactic tackling-levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tales of Tacrolimus should also be tested according to transition from programlimus, Dosiscustomization, changes of immunosuppressive Therapy, or simultaneous application of substances that could change the tacrolimus blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advaginal raf is a drug with a low Clearance, the dose of dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials include that a successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the levels are not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplants usually occur in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and in transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent detection therapy of liver, kidney, and cardiac transplant, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft statements, or other side effects, which can occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; settings of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the engmaschigen control of one in the transplant medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For treatment of adult patients with graft absorption, proved to be proved by other immunosuppressants as a refractory regiment, there are still no clinical data for retardized formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of graft patients with adult transplant receivers and graft receivers in child-age are not yet clinical data for retardized formulation Advaginal raf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which may lead to a reduction of the Tacroclimate change in the blood and a weaker of the clinical effects of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), is to avoid any other plant effects during a treatment with Advaginas (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered because the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under programyopathy was referred to as cardiomyopathy, chamber or sepia hypertrophie, which is therefore possible also under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid load and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking the Tacrolimus, symptoms for Pres such as headaches, changed consciousness levels, seizures and vision, should be a radical investigation (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advaginas satisfy hard capsules, retardized, lactose, patients with a rare hereditary gactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-gactose malabsorption is prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as Hemmer or Inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus reduce blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, the tackling blood levels in the same gift can change the CYP3A metabolism, to monitor and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain the same concentration (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1455">Impact of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tactlimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be treated with CYP3A4 due to their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contrabiceps and thus raise the hormonal exposition, which is particularly careful in decisions concerning the receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazone and can extend their half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplants transplants provide no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of unwanted events regarding the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1482">In total, the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies showed the observations in the major studies where programming in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients were used to primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplant in a intermediate analysis of a recently performed, multi-center study with oral programming has been reported in 110 patients that received either tacrolimus or cicrid porin.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Even a chronic transplant absorption, the bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year amounted to 80,8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Cicrid group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocrite level, and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound group of Tacrolimus, or caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the metabolism of the metabolism of the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic before the excretion, with the excretion mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients that were included from prograf (once daily) at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advaginal raf was nearly 10% lower than under programming.</seg>

<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of the application judge, whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or the prevention of bleeding within surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clots problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method produced as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) brought it to the formation of the human being factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is another product approved in the European Union called rebinate, but it is different, so the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood seams were awarded "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>

<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40, of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose, a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The appointment speed should be addressed after the patient's desire, where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always quantified against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk within the first 20 extrusion stage is the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition and common inhibitory development was observed after conversion of a recombinant factor VIII product to another that is observed (humility) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients ADRs were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), which were all in previously untreated patients who have higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the approval of available data, the CHMP has continued to be considered a positive rating, but considered positive, but considered that the safety profile should be closely monitored by the following grounds:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has decided on the basis of safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed the Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP), that the company takes its application for the approval of Advent by Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue, which combines other structures in the body, is surrounded and relies).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified that a gene can carry into the body's cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself, and therefore no infection can trigger in man.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow cancer cells to reproduce the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced by the non-defect in the human body existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells, if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Women's cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working correctly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study of a study involving the Li-Women's cancer in the field of substructure, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers to the questions posed by the company, some questions were still unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the assessment of the initial documents, the CHMP generates a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP's view was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of advent in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee further concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the form of administration and the security of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment, nor for people who come in contact with the patient, that is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not deal with the CHMP whether the consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified active ingredients," means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal grinous nose (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be recreated on constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measures were the changes of the severity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all the hay fever symptoms except the blockage of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze income, above a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose has been considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in patients receiving Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarate (cardiac inability), pharyngitis (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, Insomnie (sleeplessness), Somnolency (drowsiness), sleep disorders, and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are perhaps excessive (allergic) against Desloratadine, Pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenerous active ingredients or Loratadine (another medicine for allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (high blood pressure), hyperthyrosis (hyperhypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperfunction of thyroid) or have a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted an authorization of aerating Aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, if whole is to swallow (i.e. without them to bite, to break or cut).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used due to the failure of data for uncertainty and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) not for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after defending the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time for 10 days, since during long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, treatment with Desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or in the 2 weeks after the termination of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetical activity in combination of pseudoephedrine with other vasocontin, Pergoeyelid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymeterolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient-collective, and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and effectiveness of aeropaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment with occurrence of hypertension or tachometer or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a reinforcement of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">For the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with heart rhythmias • Patients with heart rhythmia • Patients with a myocardial infarction of patients with myocardial infarction in the history, diabetes mellitus, blisters of brass or bronchospasmus in history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze has at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, as antihistamines may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, in case of erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, there were no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences between the patients were detected, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin who was still not identified, so the interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate or inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unquestionability of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to human beings, and because of the vasoconstrictor characteristics of Pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases there may be a drowsiness that can lead to an impairment of traffic management or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collars) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, anxiety, muscle tensions, muscle weakness, tantinsufficiency, heart rhythmists, tachration, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, Tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotension.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atrophin typical symptoms (mouth dries, pupillenrigid and - dilatation, skin erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the hibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human fat cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesion's P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose-study of adults, Desloratadine 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement variables, including the amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at recommended dose of 5 mg, increased frequency of drowsiness was diagnosed compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause more likable anomalitic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachometer or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonist effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined based on the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal grrenal swelling), significantly higher than a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in relation to the deviating effect, determined based on the nasal grind, was significantly higher than a monotherapy with desloratadine above the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose-study to the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine reached 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosisstudy conducted with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects was found that four test subjects Desloratadine was badly changed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components study study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure to an Aerinaze Tablette.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, for toxicity in repeatability, to genotoxicity and Reproductive Toxicity, however, clinical data with desloratadine do not recognize any special dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive treatment studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was in the oral surgery in rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogen.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation for authorisation for the application of the pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviating of allergic symptoms by considering that histamine has its own substance, its effect can develop.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets lenses symptoms that appear in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or juckling nose, or juckling eyes with simultaneous constipation of nose.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerial was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adult and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the variation of symptoms (itching, number and size of addling, compromised sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as tablets and application in children unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius on average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) of 25 to 32%, compared to decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies on Urtikaria, the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% treated with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against Desloratadine, Loratadine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission informed the Company SP Europe an authorization of the establishment of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials regarding the application of Desloratadine in adolescents 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the existing disease and can be resumed after defending the symptoms and when restorations are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended for the patient during the allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were detected in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets, with erythromycin or ketoconazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, using Aerius and alcohol have not been reinforced with the higher effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases there may be drowsiness that can lead to an impairment of persistence or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported on the more common than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth-dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study involving 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse effects, which were treated at 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadine and were treated with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the hibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human fat cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesosecüls P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study of multiple outlets, in the desloratadine a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study in which Desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the Nunfold of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg. showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including the amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving the symptoms such as nioeses, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrivation and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persiating allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persizing allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As a result of the total scores of the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigating more forms of the Urtikaria, as the underlying pathophysiology has been similar to etiology at different forms and chronic patients can be simpler and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is a scientific factor in all urticular diseases is expected that Desloratadine is expected to improve the symptoms of Urtikaria in other forms of Urtica; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidance.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in improving pruritus and lowering the amount of amount and amount of torches at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of a reduction of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable in patients with generic seasonal rhinitis had been comparable, 4% of patients had higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no connection points for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, this enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin who was still not identified, so the interactions with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate or inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadine in a dosing of 7.5 mg taken meals (fetch, calorie-rich breakfast) not to availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies conducted with Desloratadine and Loratadin who showed comparative degrees of exposure of Desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadine and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety spmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity and Reproductive Toxicity, pre-clinical data with desloratadin may recognize no special dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Color film (includes Lactose Monohydrat, hymeccable, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, indigocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (contains hymless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerial may be taken independently of meals, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The recommended doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data are required to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies you should play a role in diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic Desloratadine is reduced and experienced a higher substrate load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are limited to metabolic, is identical to the children that are metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption, or insufficiency of this drug may not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found within the clinical studies of Aerius tablets, with erythromycin or ketoconazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus, which can easily spread from man to human, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the components of the influenza virus (flu virus) as "physically" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will be able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus to this tribe.</seg>
<seg id="1899">The membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, recognises the human body as body-foreign), cleansed, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1923">Agenerated is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amponavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of Agenerated in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no proteasinhibitor is not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="1924">AGenerasy was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances, since the approval of scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited granted approval for the placing of agitation in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerated is in combination with other antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children aged 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerated capsules are to be used for pharmacokinetic boopadding of Ambaboo with low doses of Knights (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambaboavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the patient's pre-treatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambaboo as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution can not be replaceable at a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agitation capsules is 600 mg of Ambaboo twice daily with 100 mg of Kavibaboo twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Ageneral capsules are used without the amplifying addition of rite avir (padding), higher doses to be used to be used (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for agitation capsules is 20 mg of Ambavavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambaboo that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agregase in combination with low doses of chionavir or other protagonists were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Generase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to the failure of data for uncertainty and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Ageneric capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day, and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions increased to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Ageneral may not be given simultaneously with medicines containing a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma centrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ambaboo during the taking of Ambaboo (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenerated or any other antiretroviral therapy is not leading to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenera does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerated capsules are to be applied together with low doses of chionavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from a antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver coexistence with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of congenital antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic hepatitis-active hepatitis showed a higher frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Ageneral and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Glukokorticoids, which will be confused about CYP3A4, is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the annex function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is highly recommended by Ageneric platinum with Lovastatin and simplatin because of the increased risk of myrrien including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening adverse events such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of international normalities), are available methods to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine simultaneously, Agenera can be less effective for reduced plasma cutting of ammonavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ambavir can be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contrasts, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Ambavavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium traffic symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of knights.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerated solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be treated with caution by certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerated should be set to 5, if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy, including proteasinhibitors, has been reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders, associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilia patients (Type A and B), which have been treated with protein inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematoms and hemmarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an antiretroviral therapy (ART) may develop an anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual-opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial transaction is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneksis were reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude should not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width of agroar must not be coupled with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma cutting with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the lower plasma protein by dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambaboo can be humiliated by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If one patient is already taking St. John's wort, Ambavirradial levels and, if possible, examine the virusload and add the St John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosisadjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given along with Ambaboo (see also Eebirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for Cmax, by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambabode capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambaboo had been prescribed twice daily and Konavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and inconsistency of this treatment device.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Ambaboo (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin value of Ambaboo in plasma, which were achieved in combination of Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Kbaboo twice daily), when Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kavibaboo twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambaboo and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it will be recommended a close surveillance, as the effectiveness and unquestionability of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study used in combination with didanosin combination with didanosin, however, due to the antacidic component of didanosin, however, that the proceeds from Didano in and agitation are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, during the gift of Efavirenz in combination with Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose of dose is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Emotirenz in combination with Ambaboo and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protests would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine on other protests and existing data suggests that Nevirapine may be sunk the serum concentration of Ambaboo possibly sunk.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced and potentially subtherapeutic plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine be used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological supervision is to be done as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambaboo and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous production of Ambaboo and Rifabutin has led to a rise in the plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin in order to increase the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is prescribed along with agregase, at least half of the recommended dose is advised, although no clinical data will be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with agregase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but may be increased the plasma cutting of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma at 25% and AUC (0%) compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, can be used together with agregase, possibly to interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be toxic to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with genera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protagonists, it is advisable that Antacids will not be taken at the same time as Agenera, because it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-convulva, known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with ammonavir can lead to a dissemination of the plasma cutting of Ambaboo.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, dipine pin, nibpin, nibpin, nibpin, nibpin, nidipine, nidipine, nibpin and diapamil can be increased by Ambaboo, thereby the activity and toxicity of this drug may be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous taking with agitation can increase their plasma percentage points considerably and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol rose by about 86% (90% concurrent intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of agregase with kavibaboo is not recommended along with these Glukokorrhoids, unless the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4 are pronounced in the plasma concentration of the same administration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspiration increases the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a rhubarb olysis, the combined application of this medication is not recommended using Ambaboo.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of mirrors, as the plasma orations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and tacrolimus may be increased with the same gift of Ambaboo (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenera must not be used together with oral-recorded Midazolam (see section 4.3), while using the current application of Agenerated with parenteral midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteashibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma torrent of Midazolam to 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Ambaboo, patients should therefore be monitored on opium traffic symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Knights.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is no recommendation to adapt like the Ambavir- dose when Ambavavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulties together with Agenerated is an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) because of the possibility of a weaker or amplification of the antithrombic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contradiction is not predictable, so alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and nortryptilin) is recommended for the same gift of agitation (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medication may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus compared to the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lakeshed rats, Ambaboo-related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambavavir affects people into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was given up to the end of the breastplate in the uterus to the end of the lactation of Ambaboo, showed an decreased increase in 12 body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of income, including Fertility and reproductive ability was not impaired by the administration of Ambaboo.</seg>
<seg id="2003">In adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medication were examined.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Ageneral treatment were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely led to treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with taking Agenera or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or if they are a result of the admiry disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events are taken from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protein inhibitors were not previously treated 1,200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were weighted by the investigators as well as in connection with the study mediation, and in more than 1% of patients have occurred, as well as the treatment of laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) with HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fawn fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie of breasts and sovious fat accumulation (stalks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">At 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons treated with Ambaboo in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudin over a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case (spikes) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study included 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Ambaboo 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs above a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash were usually slightly until moderately pronounced, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with Ambaboo had to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrose were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual-opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In patients treated with PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerated twice daily together with low-dose chavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients who received Agenera with low-borne pavir, very frequently occurring.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of transitions, the patient is observed at signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) when necessary, necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambaboo binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins steps with the consequence of a formation, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambaboo in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in akut and chronically infected lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as to peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) from Ambaboo lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm with infected cells and is 0.41 µm with chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambaboo against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-previously treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other rite cavities with proteaseinhibitors - the described mutations only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen years of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who have received 700mg of Fosamprenavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure to be studied until week 48 where 14 isolates were genotypically investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure had previously appeared within the 59, showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, CONTI / L, I47V, G4V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, V77V, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamplifavir / 100 mg of Kamponavir twice a day: n = 107), patients with virological predictions were associated with virological failure about 96 weeks, the following Proteasinhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing analysis, Genotypical Interpretation Systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambaboo / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein inhibitor isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / kavir, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, I62V, V82A / C / G / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phonic resistance to Fosampleavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to additional data, and it is advised to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyze results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phylotypic resistance tests, analysis, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypical data on the estimate of activity of Ambaboo / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein inhibitor isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies, distributing diagnostic tests tests, have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ambaboo associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross-resistant against kavibaboo, the sensitivity to the dinavir, Nelchavir and Saquinavir, but generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistance between Ambaboo and other protagonists for all 4 Fosampy Resistors, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients, with amidavavir / kavir (one of 25 isolates), inavir / kavir (one of 25 isolates), inavir / kavir (three of 24 isolates), seed avir / kavir / kavir / kavir / kavir / kavir / kavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambaboo retains its activity against some other protagonists inhibitor isolates; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can influence the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerated in combination with kavibaboo 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, together with PI (100 mg twice daily), and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosing rite cavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneral, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time adjusted average variable from the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subleeve of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unbundled Agenerated is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerated solution was used to take and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosiated rite at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients in the study included plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered with the treatment optimisation of the expected benefits of "unbundled" Agenerase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the middle duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambaboo is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax is lowered by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with Ambaboo (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambaboo with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambaboo 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous exposure of the resource absorption is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg) and can be mounted to a large distribution volume, as well as a monstrous penetration of Ambaboo in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Ambavavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Ambavavir remains constant, the percentage of free active changes during the dosing interval during the steaming concentration in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">It is therefore necessary to adable the CYP3A4 or solve a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with carts (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerated capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambaboo is made from the solution 14% less bioavailability than the capsules; therefore, Agenerated solution and Agenerated capsules are not interchangeable at a milligrammar basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the impact of a kidney disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Ambaboo and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment options lead to Ambaboo plasmodial comparable to those who are blown to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambaboo twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for the carcinogenicity with ambavavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benigne hepatocellular adenoma at dosages, which addressed the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1,200 mg of Ambaboo.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma was not fully resolved and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposition data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic use, however, yielded little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse therapy tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphoma test, microkernel test on rats and chromosome aberration to human peripheral lymphocytes was Ambaboo neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be detected and detected in clinical everyday life through the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, clinical trials have been observed no significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerated, nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young animals, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate of animals as well as with Ambavavir animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic Plasmaexposition, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thyroelongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerated capsules are used without the amplifying addition of rite avir (boopadding), higher doses to be used to be used (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for agitation capsules is 20 mg of Ambavavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambaboo that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, it was also measured its effectiveness (with regard to reducing the concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme reduced the concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), pain pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react sensitively to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is updated every year all new information that may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who keep Aldurazyme concerning reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval for the Company Genzyme Europe B.V. offering authorization of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammals (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative of the long-term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mudysaccharitin I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial index rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient is wearing it, increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme for adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion reactions that are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be supervised, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment where revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, virtually all patients IgG antibodies are to form against laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment commence.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break-up, due to the theoretical risk provisions, a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautious after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyherka) to minimize the potential occurrence infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium-infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused by means of antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion is used to reduce the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not allow to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data on newborns which were exposed to Laronidase on breast milk, is recommended to breastfeeding during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Clinical trials in clinical trials were mainly used as infusion reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme that were observed during the phase 3 study and an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently listed in the following chart: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS I-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in the history there were also severe reactions, including bronchospasmus, breaths and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted pharmaceuticals in connection with Aldurazyme that were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe failure and treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment with a server version, with a severe failure rate mostly within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or until an early retirement from the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients without a radioimmune response (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients, with which it had never been at the server version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-antibody levels referred to a robust reduction in the gag mirror, while in patients with high antibodies, a variable reduction of Gag in the harn was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutral-level effect on the enzymatic physical activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed unwanted in connection with the incidence of undesired drug transactions, even if the occurrence of undesired drug reaction typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrats and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymphoosomes, the most likely above Manni-6 phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients (age 6 to 43).</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study identified the whole disease spectrum, the majority of patients had the mean phenotype and only one patient found the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited as they were recruited by less than 80% of the expected value (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value; and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute line in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where it received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients with improved lung function and the inability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hystanders before treatment amounted to 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of gag levels in the Harn (µg / mg creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease, between the patients who were combined with the use of a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes in patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%), had no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A year-old phase 2 study was performed in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years (16 patients with severe decline in form and 4 in middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dose of increased GAG- mirrors was increased in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) determined according to the Z Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with middle course form indicate a normal mental development speed, while in the older patients with severe failure form just limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study tests on pharmacoyme dosing scheme from various aldurazyme dosing scheme on the gag mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The Dosiderschema with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may have patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion. however, it is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing scheme is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will assess any new information that will be available, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug may be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to patients with older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the Pemetreboxed gift and the day after the treatment a corticosteroid is given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetreboxed, at least 5 doses have to be folic acid, and the intake must be continued during the period of therapy and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third beam cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created prior to each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombozygotic count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to the upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose of dose must be held by the nodrs of blood balance or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predige- hending treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">According to the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which apply to ALIMTA as a monotherapy or combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-adhesological toxicity of 3 (except neotoxicity), the therapy should be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient remains the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be broken when in patients after 2 dosing products, an haemological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity is 3 or 4 or 4 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over, in comparison to patients aged 65 years, an increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to unsufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinine-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need dose adjustments needed to go beyond for all patients recommended Dosisizations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Data in patients with a creatinine-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver failure of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- boundary value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) are not specifically studied in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in relation to the Knoefmarketers and must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophelper has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte result has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutropencode, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and nithological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was recommended if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetre-treated patients must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophyllactic measure on reducing toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (creatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous taking of non-steroid antiphlogic (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindful of 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for treatment with Pemetrexed is required to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-term therapy for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occur, appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid collection in the transcellular space, there should be a drainage of the effusion in front of the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving Pemetrexed occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenued live vaccine (excluding yellowfever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage of reproductive ability exists through Pemetreboxed, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginn insisted to obtain advice on sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroid antiphlogiska (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) resulted in a reduced pemetre-separation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution applies if patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) contains high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindful of 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the actionary potential as piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulties and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of INR (International standardization ratio) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anticoagulation.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed during pregnancy, but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected during an application during pregnancy severe birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful cleaning of the farm for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can't dismantle some fats in the food, thereby resulting in the food for about a quarter of the fats.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who have 60 mg. a year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, patients could not be observed for the patient's relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) oily spots on after, fliatus (winds) with bowel movements, chair rang, fetal / oily chair, finish oils (torches), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients who are treated with ciculporin (to prevent transplanting patients) or with drugs such as warfarin for preventing blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase when alli is taken together with a low-fat burning meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes with an improved metabolic control could be, patients who should consult a drug against diabetes before the start of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist, because the dosage of antidiabetic may be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients, alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased Cholesterinspiegel, should ask their doctor or pharmacists if the dosage should be adapted to this drug.</seg>

<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins in the standard area.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended before bedtime, a supplementary multivitamin supplement must be taken to ensure adequate vitaminase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers that simultaneously received orlistat, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and related with the pharmacological effects of the medicine, as absorption of taken fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The skins are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The prevalence of certain side effects, which were noted after the market launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unwanted size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli to convert alli in terms of possible and actual gastrointestinal side effects can lead.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multi-level doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without being significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">During the majority of reported cases reported by orlistat overdoation, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on human and animal, the effects on human and animal may be derived from a fast reversing of systemic effects that are attributable to orlistat's properties.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is set up in the lumens of the stomach and the upper fertilizer, by coalente ties to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and Panamanian Lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived from clinical trials that 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day, absorption of approximately 25% of the food fatty acids.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalory, fatty fish produced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomization), was assessed as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of course (table 1) and as a proportion of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the largest weight loss in the first 6 months occurred.</seg>

<seg id="2588">These side effects occur usually within the first weeks after treatment begins, since you have not yet been consistently reduced to the fat content in the diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits: • Begin a few days or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fetal diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and about the size of the portions you usually take.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied to chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as in chemical therapies (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance means the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemical therapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi alone showed no vomiting (132 from 223), compared with 57% associated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemical therapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi alone showed no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission informed the Company of Helsinki, Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an authorization of bringing aloxi funds across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate-etogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced through a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon tape, patients with anamnesty or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable with the same gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or which tend to have an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with a further chemotherapeutic gift, Aloxi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy, nor to prevent any treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In clinical trials, Palonosetron uninhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steam-state- concentration oral metoclopramids of an CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous production of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (dexametidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, iinidine, serapaline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnancy, unless it is considered as needed by the treatment doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly stood by Aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstacpation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skies of adverse events appeared in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies conducted because of the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not an effective treatment with a Aloxi- exaggeration.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-value 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-value 7.3 hours) received intravenously on day 1 without a dexamethason intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 mcg Palonosetron received patients compared to 32 mg of Ondante that were given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of trials with moderately-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy have been summed up in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable to the effects of Ondanlla and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of the clinical investigation, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ionricular De- and Repolarisation involved ionic channels and extend the duration of the action point.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EKG-effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows a initial decrease in Plasmaconzentorations a slow Elimination from the body with an average season half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in the total dose range of 0,3- 90 m / kg in socially and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 high-cell carcinoma (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacokinetic simulations that at once daily, intravenous intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron reaches a value of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher after one-time intravenous administration; however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated from the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have compared to Palonosetron beyond less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolised have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made as unchangeable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-one intravenous Bolusine projection at the heart of the whole body, the full-body levels was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disorders, the terminale elimination period and the average systematic exposure with Palonosetron increases, but reducing the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered sufficient on the maximum of human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a small relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. clinical trials are indications that Palonosetron can only block ion channels only in very high concentrations of ion channels that can extend at the ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neopsis (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, ornierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the used high dosages and da Aloxi for unique use is determined, the relevance of these results is minimal.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Immunology (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the failure of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferone-A with the same arztably effective element that is already approved in the EU (also called "" "" reference agent "" ""). "" "</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-called) hepatitis C (a virus infection caused by a virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">A microscopic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast to stimulate a gene (DNA) to stimulate this to the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon laid data on the comparison of Alpheon with Roferone-A (active structure, composition, and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and effectiveness in Hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were indicated that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the marketable drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferone-A, was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retardant with more patients than with the reference agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test was used in the study to investigate the question, in which the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used for the treatment of impetigo (one with crust-running skin infection) and small infected Lazerations (Riss- or chiabated), scutations and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, demonstrably, or presumably by methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo does not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the treatment area should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressing the treatment for two to three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient and draw alternative treatments in consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Major indicators of the effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was removed after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients were treated to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected hounds, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates showed: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups were addressed to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has found that Altargo has been caused by treatment of abscesses (vanity cases in body tissues) or infections, which have been provoked or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation in the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo in short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections caused by the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, scents or palsy wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an authorization of the establishment of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, with which there is no improvement in two to three days, should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitisation or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is abolished, the ointment carefully detect and an adequate alternative therapy of infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infection where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary uninfected wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma percentage, which have been achieved when humans have been achieved for topical use of skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 For the current gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin salbe on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the minor system exposure to topical application in patients, Dosiscustomizations are not required if topical retriapamulin was used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive treatments and are inadequate regarding a statement of effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be only applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear, and the use of Retapamulin is to be preferable to an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">At the decision whether the breastfeeding continued / finished or terminated with Altargo, it is between the use of breastfeeding for infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which used Altargo, the most frequently reported adverse effect on the administration, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode retinapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from the fermentation of clitochus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding station of the 50s subdivision of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the obligations of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The data indicates that the association of ribosomic protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-bonds and the PeptidyltransferaseCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding, Pelromutiline transfer the peptidyltransfer, partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomic subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be based on the basis of the local prevalent resistance to the use of Retapamulin at least some Infection forms, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment in S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin Salbe was charged with occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary ininfected wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic uptake of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-microkerntest for in-vivo test chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to the people (topical application to 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats the oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (declining weight of fetus and delayed ossification) were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the permit must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system is present, as in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation order (version 6.2), and works before the product is marketed as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the domestic office is obligated to perform detailed detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the application order, as well as all additional updates by the RMP, which will be agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medical use," the updated RMP will simultaneously be submitted to the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated place, you should end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salts, creams, or lotions on the area that is treated with Altargo, if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in eyes, mouth or mouth, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of view on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor to advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After filling the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterilised bandage or a gazing tape, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Amidrix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (illnesses that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The Ambirix is applied to an existing vaccine, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is only allowed if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the existing vaccine can be taken at the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refreshment dose against hepatitis A or B is required, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have "contribute to the immune system (the body's natural defense system)," as it can fight against illness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix Adults and who has been approved in 1997 for Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same illnesses, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given an existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data used to support the application of Twinrix adults, also as proof for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicators for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Amnesty conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix looks like a sixth and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, redness, redness, fatigue (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Amidrix may not react sensitively to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologís.a. an authorization of the surrounding area of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic base with Ambirix consists of two vaccine doses, whereby the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalents vaccine or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HLW) virus and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size, according to the vaccination with the respective monovalents vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured, whether immunogeneous individuals who have addressed a hepatitis A- vaccination is a protective chimney as protection, as it may also be protected by immunological memory as well.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection substances, the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction should be immediately available after the gift of the vaccine appropriate options of medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of havalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody being achieved so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration may result in a suboptimal pulse result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, amrombocytopenie or blood coagulation disorders can be injected, however, amusing subcutaneous injections, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azellular Pertus- and Haemophilus influenza virus (DTPA-IPV / Hib), or a combined Masern- Mumps-Röttle vaccine was given, was the immune response to all antigens sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 vaccinations of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, mateness, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable with the frequency, which was observed in previous Thiomersale- and preservative inoculation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and activity on a computed basis per vaccine ambient amrix, but not on a computation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 57% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects as a result of a dose of 3-cans-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had gotten ambushings had been vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matriness was similar (i.e. about the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received amusrix compared with 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-cans-combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and matridity was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with a 3-cans inocschema.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study of 1-11 year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reaction and general reactions were comparable to the ambition associated with the 3-cans-combination vaccine with a 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, after the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a little more common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, reports.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that have caused serious side effects during the 2 doses of vaccinations, with ambition or during the 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials involving vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years were the serum-conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 abort dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 aborted dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, there were 142 two doses ambirix and 147 the standard combined fuel with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">At 289 people whose immunogeneity was compensated, the serum samples (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with the amidst of the 3-dose of hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which have been reached in a clinical comparison study of 1- to 11-year-olds within a month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccine received either a 2-cans inocschema with amamrix or a 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of the basic idea between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immunisation with amatrix in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunal reaction against both antigens was comparable to the vaccine of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination upside to the 0-12 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year is at the same time the dripping of a combined diphtheriac, Tetanus-, azellular Pertusis-, inactivated Poliomyelitis (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, showed similar Seroprotors and Seroconvergence as well as for the former formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and available in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP agreed that the benefit of the benefit ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, da amrix are only limited in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited to the low patient position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defective or hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonitions) in history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is divided into several single doses of meals - swallowed by food or over a gastrostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach-leading hose) or a nose probe (with the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a hypothalate medicine, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, liquid effects, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps prevented in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle to high ammonials.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "extraordinary conditions" "" "because of the disease of the disease only limited information on this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme deficiency already in newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-party form (incomplete enzyme defective, which is manifest after the first life of life), an indication of the use when in the history a hyperspacial encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with gorges, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamase is the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with gorcking disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera, if the tablets are not able to get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) containing sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore insufficiency in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and oedetion in clinical states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As a metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with external caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">During the subcutaneous gift of phenylacetic to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of the neurons and resulted in a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted if Phenylacetate is out of the human breast in the breast milk and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS was contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE), and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old anorealist patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose tin, severe hypokalemia, Panzyenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month-old small child with a healthy single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed dosistive neurotoxicity with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacacetate is a metabolic active compound which conjugated by acetylamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylene is comparatively similar to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat is produced between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis was granted early and treatment immediately, to improve survival for survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest symptoms of the disease with occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infested, and the disease led to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to havalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetic), proteins reduced Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first life of life) diagnosed with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate came with many to many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-ogeneous form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of ornithintranteratocyylase deficiency), which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and reduced diet permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a diet reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Even existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacacetate which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were treated according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in sober-related healthy adults, hemoglobal metabolism and liver cirrhosis according to individual charges and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients following intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma percentage (phenylbutyrat) were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea fatigue or hemoglobbinopathy was detectable after various doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, no phenylacetic in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma concentration were five times higher than the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated production phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clastogenic effects in rats no clastogenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral, infants and children who can't swallow any tablets, or patients with gorcking disorders) or over a Gastrostomieschi or a nostride.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifold deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamase is the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) containing sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat necessities were exposed to the birth of phenylacetic (active Metabolic lit by Phenylbutyrat), it came into lesions in the pyramids of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18 year old anorealist patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose tin, severe hypokalemia, Panzyenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylene is comparatively similar to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess weight</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of research on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrat produces between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations were detected by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case the small measuring scoop 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must have received the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver preparations are missing, so they can not exterminate the sticky waste products, which can accumulate after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When using laboratory studies, you need to inform the doctor that you are using AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When using AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the lactation time you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS, as the medicine could go over to breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, flavours, reverse the hearing, disorientates, memory deficits and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms at oneself, please contact your doctor or contact your hospital emergencies in the introduction of a corresponding treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the intake of AMMONAPS, take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes of blood images (red blood cells, white blood cells, throatocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, uncomfortable skin rash, rash, kidney dysfunctions, weight gain and abnormal laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacists when one of those listed side effects may significantly impairs or you may notice effects that are not specified in this manual information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS after switching on the box and the extent of "usable up to" given expiry date no longer.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS look and contents of the AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish colour and oval shape, and they are equipped with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If there are laboratory studies, you need to notify the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2876">When using AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS distributed in same single doses or via a stomach feeble (hose, runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach) or a nose probe (hose, which is led by the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped measuring scoop Granules. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a measuring reed above the edge of the knife to remove surplus granulate. • Take the recommended number of measuring scoop Granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in chest basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "St- Hebung" (an abnormal measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent clots in patients who undergo a PCI is administered a higher dose and infusion can be continued up to four hours after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute in patients with angina or palms to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared with the conventional combination of heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube, which remains in the Arterie to prevent a shutter), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - during the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI was angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparine, except for serious bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) against bivalent (allergic) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must not be applied in patients who recently had a blood pressure, as well as with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Humanarztant (CHMP) came to the conclusion that angiox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a midable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission announced the Medicines Company UK Ltd. an authorization of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI) is scheduled for emergency access or if early intervention is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed in further sequence a PCI should be given, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Directly before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage for angiox in patients with a PCI is comprised of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence lower ACT values, the constitutional and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the Bolusdosage rapidly intravenous intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg of infusion is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), the one PCI is treated (whether using Bivalirudin versus ACS or not), a lower incidence rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is 225 mg / kg, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is to be dismayed and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney disease, which included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which included for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin Bolus without Dosisadaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox takes 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous gift of untreated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous gift of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• more known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other hemoraneous hemoraneous hemoraneous hemoraneous hemophilia. • severe kidney disease and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored in relation to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI-patients under Bivalirudin, most bleedings on arterial points can occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during the treatment of principle of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are using Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin should be considered to be a monitoring of the INR value (international normalised ratio) to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalirudine reaches the treatment existing prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of an anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregated shemmer), this active ingredients may be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In any case the combination of Bivalirudin aggregated aggregates or anticoagulcipes are the clinical and biological hemogstaseparameter in any case regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental tests are inadequate regarding the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, inadequate or postnatal development insufficient (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either untreated Heparine or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups associated with heparin, there were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined after ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding, as defined in table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both slight and heavy bleeding occurs less frequently than in groups associated with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in a diameter of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood pressure, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood pressure, Reoperation due to a blood circulation, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are listed in table 6 in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of transitions, treatment with bivalirudine immediately break off and the patient engmaschig in relation to monitor signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinocor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as at the animonenbindenting region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bonds of Bivalirudin at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin turn up the bond of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby creating the function of the active center of thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine induced thrombocytopenie / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) had come to inducing no thrombocytes-reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dosis- and concentration-dependant anticoagulation effect that is proved by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed on the following in the case, an additional Bolus of 0,5mg / kg of Bivalirudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes, requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutted subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or is administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot produce sufficient insulin control of glucose (sugar) in the blood or process the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs a very low level of human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter mode has more than a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effectively in the body, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicators for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glyphylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% at insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% compared to six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human level insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) against insulin injections or any of the other components, or in patients who suffer from a hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission approved the Company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the establishment of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is administered as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or Deltamuskels or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose monitoring capacity and the diminished insulin injections, the insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function can be diminished.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or treatment of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin paid diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Adjustment of one patient on another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active account of the insulin-related insulin profile and can therefore change to transformation of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, oral antidiabetic, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifine, propoxylic, saliperate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, the symptoms of sympatholytics such as fraudulous, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserves can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of adrenergen counterfences.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on Reproductive Toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is unknown whether the insulin injectors are exaggerated in human breast milk but generally, insulin does not occur in the mother's milk, nor is it resorised to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the clinical trials listed in clinical trials are listed, grouped by system organs and are frequent: ≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000.</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to alternate the injection of injections within the injection range, in a row a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be treated using a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an equivalent person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glued projection, the patient should be supervised in a hospital in order to determine the cause of cause severe hypoglycemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the mode of operation is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lulisations showed a dose of proportional gluing effect, and at 0.3 A / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose tolerance effect, precisely as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast efficiencies, such as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose tolerance effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly stated that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postdenial glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insullulisin 2 minutes before the meal was grounded, a better post-denial control was given as a human normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insullulisin 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control like in human normal insulin is given (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulant in the gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal has been given in comparison to human level, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human level, 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">After the beginning of the meal, insulin luliseth was given at the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was 2 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
