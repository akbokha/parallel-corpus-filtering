If a part of the text is selected, only this section is translated into the entire & URL;
Machine translations are very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations are not dependent on important decisions without checking the translation previously.
Only websites in the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page yourself, where you can insert the texts directly.
The package & package; contains different modules for & Konqueror;. despite their low size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions from & Konqueror; by making this easier available.
For more information about the use of & Konqueror; and the built-in functions please find in the manual.
To load these modules in the & Konqueror; choose settings, select settings. open the card tools and select the required modules.
This is a list of standard modules from KDE; Addons. please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.
You should install the kdebase package, which & Konqueror; contains before you compile this package.
To use the crash module, click on & Conqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror, or the list of stormy, if available, erase.
The Modular Filter (also known as folder filters) can be reached in the & Konqueror; menu bar under extras. with the module you can filter & Conqueror; 's actual work directory on different way filters.
To view the DOM tree view in the & Konqueror; select Extras DOM tree to view... and open a new window with the DOM of the document. as default, the display will display the root notes of the document, example: the element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root nodes.
The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; represents a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.
The special feature of & FSView; exists in this case with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. every object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinated objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.
At & FSView; size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is specified. thus, large files, even then easily identified, if they can be easily detected in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands you to be considered.
In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap-representation of a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. easier navigation have the rectangles of useful colouring and labelling settings.
The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view of color mode, can be either deepened to the light detection of the synchronous letters or the figure of another file size such as name, owner, group or MIME type.
A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for every feature, you can specify if enough space is available or if the surface is available to display or whether the surface is displayed by restrictions at the sign of the Treemap. in addition, you can define the relative position of labelling in rectangle.
For actors for Treemaps, the rule should be kept proportionately on the size of the entry. at the treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be kept. in order to display the entries of entries, and these frames will be no longer available, which is less space for the frame, if the rectangle is square.
As issuing the area of an entry to the subordinated entries, the implementation is left up. here, it is necessary for the signage and to avoid space losses due to always beneficial areas that are possible as square. the best methods of this are lines, columns or recursive.
You can specify the minimal surface area for entry over the menu entry. instead, a Rautal pattern is drawn into the size of the overordered details, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.
Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets, designed for use KCachegrind.
The picture gallery can be found in the & Konqueror; -Menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.
When you call the picture gallery, a dialog opens up with which you can designate the gallery's appearance.
The option title of the page allows you to customize in a text input field the title of the picture gallery site.
The option pictures per line has a slider and a rotary field to set the number of miniature images of each line in the gallery.
Indicate the filename ename of the image, indicate whether the filenames are displayed below the miniature images in the gallery.
Show the file size of the picture, show whether the file size is displayed below the miniature version in the gallery.
Indicate the size of the image size, see if the size of pictures below the miniature images are displayed in the gallery.
In the dialog folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which subfolder should be included.
In file selection Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be stored.
With the crustacking subfolder, you can set with a shooting or a rotary field, up to which level the subfolder are included.
With the checkbox original pictures, you specify whether the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.
With the comment field commentarid you can define a comment file for the labels in the gallery.
In the crossroads, you can specify a different colour depth for the miniature images than in the original pictures.
The module & HTML; -Settings offers an easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & Konqueror;.
The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & Konqueror; -Menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:
You can view the media playback for the navigation area in the & Konqueror; view menu under window navigation area or with the keynote F9.
To play, click on the navigation department of the & Konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback.

An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digitised; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course each medium and any card reader that will be supported by your operating system, with & digitization; work together.
& digitipassed; contains a quick image processing with basic training tools. you can use these to evaluate your photos, comment, evaluate and correct. the editing skills can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins interface (manual) modules.
Although & digitipassed; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour pauses - workflow.
Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; on camera or lens, can be searched for.
Like all & KDE; programs is also & digitipassed; an open source project. that means it is based on the support of the Endanwender. they should therefore report problems and improvement.
& digitipassed; attempts to make the transfer of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. if you are using this link, your web browser doesn't open a page in the error report system. all the information you are already registered here. follow the instructions to send your report.
& digitipassed; is a project that is supported by a community. i.e., the user and developer is helping each other. if you have a regular user from & digitipassed; then, we will be able to answer any questions of other users. in this mailinglist, English language is spoken, you should be powerful in this language.
You can also see the digitization; homepage visiting, news about released versions and other information about & digitipassed; to learn.
The best start to participate in & digitipassed; registration in the developer mailing list. guide to report in the developer mailing list of & digitipassed;.
If you start & digitipassed; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply type path names, or click on the folder icon Folder symbol to select a folder.
In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data is stored. this path remains the same for all images.
Later you can add many folder as you would like to add. & digitipassed; you will also use as an AlbenLibrary. settings digikam set up collections
If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images contains, as basic file name. & digitipassed; considered every subfolder as album. no picture will be changed while searching for the folder you'll get a progress indicator as seen:
& digitipassed; durest recursively the librarian path in its whole depth. you can no subfolder, unless it was iste in hidden file. this allows you to insert exceptionally in hidden file. you can do a point before the name of the subfolder.
If you take an existing file with photos as base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albends have no photos as symbols. you can change that by using any photo taken out of the album and then use it on the folder icon. more details can be found in section Albums.
As soon as you configure the base folder, you can set up in & digitised; you should learn how to use My albums and my sample box to manage your photos in the albums.
Rohdateidae: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can use & edit; perhaps also handle it. the support is based on the librown library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Rohkamerasupport.
How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-Decodersettings and Roh workflow.
An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digitised; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course each medium and any card reader that will be supported by your operating system, with & digitization; work together.
Modern digital cameras are distinguished by using Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera also appears as a record mill. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).
& digitipassed; uses the program gPhoto2 to communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.
Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. because photos in general files are slow and broadcasts on the serial port is now obsolete. & digitipassed; supports this cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.
Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to read the pictures of digiKam reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may need to see any role models, or the generation could not be slow or the generation could be very slow.
One of the most beautiful things at & digitipassed; it's how easy to extend its functionality by modules:
KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins interface Project (manual) is a approach to develop a common module structure for & digitization;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules all the graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.
Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much easier, & digitipassed; by writing a small module to complement one function than changes in & digitipassed; self carried out.
To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + switching mode + F.
Pulling and dismantle of images is working everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal cutting line or in another application window. the only limitation is not a picture in keyword, date list or searching.
- a file selection allows you to spread the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies, and Audio
The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently being displayed in the symbol view. so the filtern is displayed on the filename only if this ind is displayed as a symbolic view. which fields will be displayed in the dialog box.
The view & quot; My Albenliftquot; presents an organized view on your photo albums. these albums can be stored in a single album properties, in which it was stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenchProperties or after the date where the album was first created, the date can be changed in the properties of the album.
If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose the album Import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. choose the album importing screen photo.
To move a picture of an album to another one or move, you can select the photo using the mouse on the target album and drop in. you can also postpone or copy the picture through copying or copying. simply select all the pictures and move it to the target album.
An album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to give information on this collection. to access the album characteristics, you need to click on the album button and select the album button in the context menu.
Album- collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can choose from a common name. you can sort or delete albums from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do it in the settings for collections.
The album date: used when you sort your albums after date with View albums, sort by date.
The buttons elders, average, latest: these set the date on the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. in addition, the average of the images from their EXIF information is being failed instead, the date of last changes every file is used in this folder.
If you first opened an album in & digitituce, the first picture will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlignquot; selected. this should help you remember the photos of the album. sometimes this photo is not representative of the album and you might want to select another photograph as a symbol.
To select another photograph as album symbol, you need to click the image with the right mouse button & quot; As Albumprepreview quot; select. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.
An album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be sparked.
& digitipassed; supports the entry of keyword for individual photos in the main window. album collections have another effect. this collection includes all photos of the album. you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos.
The picture window provides you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this look at the toolbar.
If you open an album the first time you need to wait shortly, while the umbnails will be generated. you can avoid that you can create any role models in the Menu Extras.
Information on each picture will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can change via settings; set up here. select the Albums page and customize your wishes.
The umbnails have a relief window, the appearing. if you leave the mouse pointing a moment over a picture. the help shows the key features including all of the photos of a photo. the screen picture above shows in the main window displaying such a relief window.
Photos are all about what it comes at & digitidy. albums and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures so how it suits you. you can get all the functions that come with & digitidy. you can reach the menu in the menu bar or the menu image in the menu bar. you have the choice between viewing the images, a slide or processing of images.
You can open the image editing with a photo by sending either F4 image processing... or select the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and editing... click here; image editing you will find a manual how you can edit your photos. with the photo editing you can view your photos and change them.
It may happen that & digitipassed; the functionality you need are not available. you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse menu and select the program from the sub menu. to do this, and how you will need to customize your needs if your program is not listed, you will find information in & KDE; manual.
You should note that after processing different educational programs that may come to problems with the picture-containing metadata. some programs do not save this data with, if you store the modified image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, blending, etc.
& digitipassed; introduces two possibilities for rotation. the easiest way to click and select the right mouse button. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.
To change the filename of a photo you can click with the right mouse button to select and select F2 reaming from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, etc;).
If you delete a photo of & digitised; delete it in the trash bin of & KDE; postponed. F8 image deleting or unf if you prefer to really delete it, you can use it by using Shift; entf.
The view & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos using the data. & digitised; uses the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of last change in the file.
If you select one month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet below in the date of date, so only the photos of the selected days are shown.
Photos with Keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and be cataloged. Tags are stickers that have been assigned individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword was assigned a photo, the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or a search again.
If one keyword is selected, all photos, which were marked with this keyword, are displayed.
Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. you can also be able to organize your keywords: so you can also find parts of the tree & quot;
The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in IPTC data fields of the picture, at least for JPEG, stored. so, you can also use your keywords in other programs. additionally, the keywords will be imported when loss of database re-imported; the images noticed.
You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword. if you have a new keyword, then click on an existing keyword, this keyword will be added to this keyword.
You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select deleting. if you delete a keyword, the photo is not deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.
You can change the position of a keyword by clicking on the desired position in the tree and place there. then there's a menu that gives you the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in tree.
You can change the characteristics of a sample by clicking with the right mouse button and select keyword menu keyword. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot;
To select another photograph as album symbol, you'll need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As Albumtemplate. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.
To use & digitidy; s functionality is provided with keyword content. this may first look at two ways: once you want the photos below, you can drag them to the respective keyword on the picture. alternatively, you can also click here with the right mouse button to locate the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.
You can choose a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you choose one of the keyword. on this type you can choose one keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event, where it was made etc.
Once you have a photo with keyword, this will display the preview of the picture displayed in the main window.
You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photos and select from the menu menu. the menu only shows you that were assigned to the photo.
The timing-view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a select frame can be postponed about this histogram. to select a time frame, you just need to select one time frame. this allows all the related images displayed in the main window.
In the box below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.
Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and in the future more.
Nebucher Suchbox is a small lamp that will find the green if the search takes place. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all the images appear again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.
The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with binoculars hidden. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. you can find this search here as a live search, which always filter out what you have been released as search criterion. after you are stored, it has been saved in the list.
If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the text field spittle search as is used to select a name in my search list. if you want to change your selection after searching for once, you just need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in his context menu.
If you're looking for searching, the form will be released to search the search query back with the previously marked search information. if you are looking for an advanced search, the dialog appears to search for your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching for. more information can be found in section The tool for Extended search.
If you want to delete an existing search out of the list, select your search in the context menu.
The Advanced Search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters available, with which you can search in certain fields of & digitilt; s database can seek.
The list of search rules is used to reset the options for a search query / search group. all rules can be added or deleted by operators. every option can be associated with other information about the logical operations all..., One..., No... or min. furthermore, you can search for type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.
& digitized; characterizes any picture through a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. these enables images to compare these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image trees, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.
Similar entries: this is a range in which you can drop any picture. by using a swelling, the results can be enlarged or shrinks. if you push a picture from somewhere about the symbol of wavy search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can leave it there.
Sketch: freedom and colour sketch: draw a fast sketch and & digitils; find the right pictures. even here, a swelling can be set.
This rider provides an intuitive map material based on the Marble-Miniature. press Ctrl; left mouse buttonpot to pull a square. press Ctrl; left mouse buttoned to pull a square. all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is naturally occurring your images Geo-data.
In the bottom bottom, you can specify a name for your Geo-filters. this will then be added to a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.
& digitipassed; presents an illuminator in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. he works with all supported image data formats, also raw files, together.
Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The luminous add-up menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated advertising and open windows. if you are back in & digitised; main window, you can open the illuminator quickly with L Extras luminous.
From the front bar you can pull the pictures you compare, in the left or right corner of the window and place there. if you assign a preview of the toolbar and / or check-up operations on one of the pictures, then you will also be able to compare these images in the same image.
Another mode is better to use quickly from a picture series. if you're using combination modules, the two first pictures will automatically be able to display it in the left-hand side. the right image will be displayed in the right side. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.
Of course, the normal solving activities also work directly from the illuminator, e.g. F4 file editing....
All images from the right sidebar panel are available for both pre-sighted images in the luminaire. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.
At the bottom of each mountain you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can detect on the crossed arrow. to hold the visible section of the image, you must click here and see the & LMB; in the mode, both pictures will show the same image sector.
The zooming is just as in other views. simply use the zoom controllers under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out into the picture. this happens in both images when you are in the mode preview mode.
What is a digital stock management -away from the word word? digital inventory management is considered each part of the process after the final edition and permanent storage. each of the photos takes up, scanned or digital photos stores a form of digital data administration. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.
We give you a tool, plan, and practical tips on how to secure your pictures, use, protect and use photos again. we look at the procedure for digital photographs that use & digitites. we look at the procedure for digital photo photographers, assure, assess, understanding, archive, optimizing, waiting, waiting and export of image files.
& quot; Digital Stock Management takes up, indicated, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, contradicated and exported to the content of an monetary or cultural value. quot;
Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is defined according to your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data, which are managed by an application or environment.
I couldn't claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't want to know how many photos you have. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will definitely want to save & digitised;. the approach the metadata is guaranteed to store very fast searching and secure archiving for you with other programs, platforms, and formats.
The first thing you do and know before you have something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos should be able to store them on your reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you need to change it sometime on a larger drive.
Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you are enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then you can then publish a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.
Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.
What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack of data easier. split new files.
The separation of original and working files simplified a securing strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived picture.
We also recommend the metadata option in the entry page of the metadata in & digitised; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written in the file. if you forgot this, then you can also save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.
Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want what if you want to change? this represents a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.
Now begins the real work, as you should now choose each photo keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all pictures that will need the same attribute. you start the best with the evaluation or the leaderboard. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos on the more work.
Let's now continue with keyword, key words, as you are frequently hot in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.
If you import catalogised pictures from another source with embedded keyword, then & digitized; automatically add the tree to the right place. changing the Hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done through the move of a subtree to another. the changed words are taken from & digitidy; updated as it pursues the sub-trees.
The graphics show how different metadata is exaggerated. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar dates from all images.
Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to accusations or comments, the third important tool to catalyze your metadata.
You want to just let anyone not only see your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure how your photos arrive.
Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details to see people who place.
And now I tell you that this is the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama.
For others who look at your photos is the title perhaps more important than the picture itself. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help you to help Him to help him about the motive that she moves you understand what you understand.
It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a labeling to work alone.
With & digitifications, you can save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as a labels. if you export your pictures into web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the labels and / or the title of web-gallery. so, you have to tell the story for the opening act no second time.
Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not Earth not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed.
The possibilities of the geolocalization are already incomprehensible. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually open your journey through pictures with geographic data. this shows the pictures also to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; export to the Google Maps viewer.
& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.
The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digitipassed; when information is deposited:
Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, for example, to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can not be changed. this field does not support compmas nor semicolons as separator.
Author title (synonymous with author): associated with the author. this field includes the photographers name. examples of this field includes titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment on the car field, it must be filled in this field.
Editor (synonym for suppliers): use the Anbideterfeld to identify anyone who offers the photograph. if the photographer is working for an news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the Group / Agency will be offering the image here.
It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they don't have any protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with computer, this, in the picture embedded metadata, erase or change. the solution for the majority of your photographs are just of low interest. for professionals and Halb professionals this protection is very important.
The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitipassed; there will be such a module available in the near future.

Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are those that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, we are about problems with the so-called new media.
Kroll Ontrack, the largest data manufacturing company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data.
To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs to combat these cautious needs and you may not take you longer than a few years. of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archivquality. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you think the store is in your measurable game room.
CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording, and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but they write a lot more reliable. so it turns to the right choice.
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control unit to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protective material they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;
For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a favourable program named IsoBuster, which apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs. but it's still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.
Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disc.
Burn slowly with a good recording device to high quality media in a non-propriated format. read the media with a description, date & author marks and afterwards in a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read these media.
Discourse keep your statistics for itself. its manufacturing facility include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives to this topic: discourse study
Shortly: Disks stop the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature controllers, the most common errors case, SMART can't determine this error. some of the SMART fixed error occurs immediately. these are particularly readers and refractionaries. the expected life-time amounts between 4 and 5 years.
This is just the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you secured the files, but these losses are usually able to restore any major problems.
While most electric devices do not make a lot of energy, this can cause severe damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage, hard drive age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.
The most widespread protection against rapids is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest comes. it is usually available in form of a plug-bar. but remember that not every plug-in bar also contains a overvoltage protection.
If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects against lightning strikes and protects the properly connected devices.
Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage halves that also provide a phone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cables of cable modems and the TV card.
If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore you also contain the protection for your modem. this is ideal for on the road.
While overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctuations in power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a ruptible power supply.
In addition to protection before overvoltage, these devices can automatically save your data to save and shutdown the system. some models allow them to continue to work until the power run. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements, such as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifespan of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.
Remember the potential risk that your host system is exposed and compare its safety when avoiding these. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about how well your computer is protected. at the end you should always remember all cables before you drive in the holidays.
The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software. Google shared storage is a further popular offer you can save on data.
They are compared to hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on comparatively slow Internet.
The solutions are therefore suitable for a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.
Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com make online storage services to have access to photos. their free memory is available to you. the professional version is not available to you, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory that should be checked in reality.
From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol, and in the great firms it is included in the offer a fuse and a distribution of memory. thus, they are desaster.
The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the hosts. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safe.
The worst thing is that you don't tell you when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have been destroyed in your computer. no one seems to have thought that in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably safer data transfer than that of your computer.
Unreliable network parts are another source of broadcasts, since they generate interruptions within data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.
Even if you are currently not particularly affected by broadcasting problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.
ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle labels on a low level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms using the zfs and is also available for Linux; but it is still not part of the kernel.
Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. at notebooks, the share of theft can be 50%.
Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them. it leads to a lower damage than such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has already been sighted for a long time.
Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. find a very good English article here.
Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem arises, it is lost.
Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.
Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology develops, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.
Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is the optimum temperature for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.
You get a 750GB HDD today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone responsible for any data loss. thus, you make sure your data is often subject to a plan and test these backup before making any more dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives.
Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a flash, you're lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.
A disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. don't forget pilot disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.
Therefore Desaster has always a non-local store. bring up your fuses up, into the neighbouring house, your office or similar.
There is another advantage of physical separation: as already mentioned above is a common cause for a loss of data despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.
Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a moment recording without histories and represents a complete copy at a time.
Differential: a backup of files that have been changed since last complete backup. this creates a complete moment of time at two time points: the complete recovery and the last differential.
Secure backup: a backup of files that have been changed since last backup. this creates several moments. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes to a versioning system, next with the exception, which is not fasted and not continually running.
Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be able to set up your machine. unlike script-controlled ftp meetings or other types of file transferring scripts, rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this happens when compress and if you want to increase security via ssh.
Secure important pictures directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.
This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore them again. at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment intake for at least one month and a moment intake for every month. any further thinners should be done manually after you have done a complete review.
Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original store, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.
So that valuable images will survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:
Because the future is unforeseeable because of your nature, you must be careful and re-evaluate while the time is passing. unfortunately, there is no other way to keep a certain quilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.
This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.
Virtualization is now available for everyone. if so, if you have an old system, it's important to read and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.
On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert newer standard. stay with open standards.
Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. it actually means to increase.
Let's assume that you have set the scalability with the area and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this section and relocate the new record:
Check the dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't append them.
/ dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBLE; # works with ext3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resistant / dev / sadc1 # change the size of rice if necessary
Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read, then you can create this yourself. this task will be easier for year to year.
GIF is a proprietary, patented format which appears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.
PNG has been replaced as an open source standard for GIF-bit, and it can be much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. the downside is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and have a slow compression. this format will recommend you to save your pictures.
TIFF was widely used as a format format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression saline (defending). however, it manages to store images in this format. a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.
DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw file format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and to use the use of metadata. a handy camera manufacturer DNG is already available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon.
This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to enroll their data into a file itself. the file information is used with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.
Many photographers prefer to archive photos from the image file, mostly in the rough format. however, it can go to problems with the image file. however, it can be updated to problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you're using DNG as container and put everything there.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI-communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissistic efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.
Import images from camera, card readers or scanner. so long the images are on camera editing, you can use this as temporary backup.
Convert Rohfiles to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.
For a hostile handling, you can use external programs again. if you are editing the pictures again with & digitifications, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under any circumstances of the other programs.
Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. simply export them in wegaleries, encode in MPEG, please use in contact page, print & etc;
The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitidy. in section adding a photos to an album, you can find a description how you can already have photos on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album bench.
To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect these with the machine, turn the camera to the display mode, and turn them on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.
When you start the camera interface, you try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fermentor indicator will appear at the bottom. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.
Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about every entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.
This dialog displays file features and the photoinformation to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that with some digital cameras don't have any information available.
The Rider Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. the picture is the same as in the metadata sidebar out of the main window of & digitization; or the image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.
The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from your camera to a single album in & digitised;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.
If you don't want to download all photos required by selecting the default users of & KDE. once you select the photos, you can download the button download and then download the chosen button. the button chosen is out as long as you have chosen several photos.
When your camera support this, is an option available for download. these pictures were now not published by & digitization; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures are available with a star in advance window. if you choose this option, you will only download the new pictures.
If you want to download or download the buttons, select a dialog with which you can select the target album, select the list of existing albums, displayed in section My Albums, then select the target album from the list and press OK.
After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digitipassed; loads the photos from the camera to the album.
Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all on once, using the button Delete All delete. if you want to delete only some, then you must first select it and delete the chosen chosen.
Please note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera again. you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted in a & digitidy; -album downloaded, before you delete it from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera image, you should make it much faster than that.
Cameras use as a filename for the photographs often not particularly meaningful names. this can be used to double the file names, if you can download photos of different recording spots to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made in the filename.
In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for dates. if you use this last option, a folder will be created per day.
The options while transferring three further options that will be performed before the photos stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information is copied to the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded photos.
If you wish to use another date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% -% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date and time to add. for further adjustments you should read the command strftime.
When you use the option camera filenames, you have the option to download the filenames in lowercase. or if you prefer it, if you prefer this.
The new file name, den & digitipassed; for a photo, is displayed below the name, which will display the camera in preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.
& digitipassed; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the recording session. not all cameras use this information. in section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information you embedded in the photo.
The automatic rotation is switched on, and when your camera does not deliver these information, & when your camera switches off, use the button Advanced. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.
If your camera is information about the date, where the photo was made, it can use & digitises; this substrate is based on the image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras display this information. in section page sidebar meta-data you can check that information your camera could have embedded in the photos.
This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced. use the Advanced Extended Enclosure options at the bottom of the window.
The easiest way to download photos from their host to your camera is to download. select upload. file extension dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.
After the image selection is done, asks & digitipassed; you, where the pictures will be uploaded. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.
GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant, which can be displayed in length and latitude. data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the european Galileo or any other system.
Not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses an airplane to carp an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.
If you've forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a browser to another & digitiff; if you want to submit a postcard to another & digitiff; users want to localize the location, or simply select this aspect, it is good to add the position data of a photos.
The question is how do the GPS data be supported in the image? first you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card referral. the question is at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, about a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and last of the manual input of well-known places.
As far as we know, there is currently no camera to integrate a GPS unit. but there is a couple who work with GPS receiver. either as a ticket module or through transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth.
Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony
Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, however, this data must be stored in the GPX format, since this is the only format that is supported by the module's geographical assignment.
There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, who can extract and correlate the data of images and from GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto
If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script which works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs are used to be used by maps.google.
Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.
& digitipassed; trying to give you so much control over his working processes as possible. there are many adjustments containing the behavior of & digitifications. in order to modify this settings, you need to set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.
Action select can be advertised on single-lined preview or edit image editing. therefore, you put the default behavior of & digitipassed; firm, if you click on an entry in the main view.
This site contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data will automatically be selected in the relevant IPTC data fields, if the option is synchronised when downloading the camera database, this data is written in the IPTC fields.
Authoring is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this field should be the photographer as described photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is an additional description to the car field, this must be also filled.
The editor is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author, if this is a photo agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here, then the Group or agency should be available here, then the Group or agency will be available here.
The IPTC actions save the data into the relevant IPTC-Felder. this is achieved that the metadata is permanently present in the picture and not only in the database of digitization;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitization; imported will be imported without being lost.
Image labeled as embedded ink keys (JFIF) in JPEG image: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with the pictures embedded in pictures. attention: with pictures that already contain bulftings, these are overwritten by the & digitization; overwritten.
The site settings contains all the options for the information that appear if the mouse indicator will rest in the main window above a file. according to selected option, this information is displayed or not.
& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which file types & digitipassed; to determine which file types & digitipassed; Albumordner, which has no such extensions, ignored from & digitipassed; ignored.
The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Refresh to the right of each category.
The settings of the lighthouse of & digitization; can be set on this page to default values. every time you can't open the luminous mode. however, the option & quot; In all the image size ladenquot; should you only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get the better visibility.
By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color you can use this here. you can switch the toolbar here if you can use the imaging tool in full screen mode.
Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors can be specified here. in the image processing this can be switched and switched on with F10 and F11.
The Chroma sub sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the following statement.
With the PNG tooling setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a low-loss algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value onto a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.
With the option TIFF files compress you can switch to TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it has no influence on image quality as the defect algorithm is lossfree.
With the lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you have the loss of loss of loss, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata was still not supported, but was found in planning.
In previous versions of & digitipassed; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs. currently, it develops rapidly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the attitudes of image editing.
The default value is that all green pixels are equal to more sensitive to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, this is a bit soft, eliminates this problem with minimal loss of details. this option records the image a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.
If this option is set, the bald balance is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.
This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use solid coloured balance, photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.
This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. by using the second sensors, the effect that exposed photos can get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored.
The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your pictures are burned down, because of the inability of your camera displays the Spitzlichter in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shlichens.
This is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw try therefore to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still non-saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.
If you select the option, you will get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and / should be adjusted for each image individually.
Put the luminance value according to your taste. you'll probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be made later in the image options of the & digitightness. this can be too small in order to keep the time for the demo procedure, you should be conservative.
A demo process algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data sensor that have many cameras and that have a Matrix coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbrella.
& nbsp; and Dcraw made three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates colour artefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.
If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue ofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be performed during the rough drive.
A profile translates the color information and gives instructions to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digitidy; information such as color information by one color space in the other are to be translated as precisely as possible.
Behavior If a picture is opened in image editing / color management module with rough files.
Color profile file Put here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digitipassed; check out the folder during the start.
Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.
The design features is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen.
The input profiles should be used to the camera producer and model that you use. not all profiles are built on the same species. currently there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain any color mapping or gammacorical correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not mean for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you need to carry out the colour mapping itself.
There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, which you can emulate how your image will print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be correct instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer.
For most cameras it's pretty obvious which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. this is therefore a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:
The Canon profile expansion will recognize the style for the goal: F for precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.
KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image analysis and image editing is supported. many modules support, which were written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.
If your distribution has installed the KIPI module, you will see a list of available modules. select which you want to use and these modules will be loaded as new entries in the main menu, and also you will find some also in the context menu of the presentation.
Short command for tasks that can be carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short command.
More information (in English) via KIPI modules are available via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugin.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.
The settings of the diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper knobs is adjusted time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other crossroads turn the metadata one or, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.
The camera characteristics appear on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is tried to identify the camera properly, switched on and in the image display mode. these are currently serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass memory.
At the lower end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire cameras (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage era. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt /., specify your camera on which you are attached to your camera.
To use your digital camera with & digitization; you need to connect the camera to your computer, turn it into the display mode and turn off.
Try out whether & digitization; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera name and port manually. after having set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's Camera menu.
You can select any designation for your camera. this will display cameras of the master's main menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.
With the confirmation dialog for the moving of > pictures in the trashboard, you can set the talk of & digitites; when deleting a photos in an album, you will find further details in the deletion of a photos and deletion of an album.
The editorial changes made by the right sidebar can be tacitly by & digitized; applied if you use the option changes in the right side bar with unquestioning. otherwise, you will need to use the changes with the button changes.
You can also adjust the display of the splash screen of & digitised; accelerates under the start. this accelerates the start-up procedure of & digitites.
If you are looking for new photos looking for new photos and digitipassed; the base folder was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos. if something was deleted from the base folder, & when something was deleted from the base folder, she asks; she, if it is supposed to delete it from the database.
Various color schemes can be used in & digitization; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can select under Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:
These designs are defined in simple textfiles. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitization, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.
& digitipassed; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and improve the image editing on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the details advertised / editing.
The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitised; so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules are set up in the section of the image processing section.
A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filenary, extension factor, and the current image size.
A menu bar at the top edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.
The processing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, no one functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button stores from the tool bar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo, once you have saved the picture.
So you should install a copy of your image before you change it. you can do it with file saving.
As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by re-establish or the button The button to restore the imaging in the tool bar. you then lose any change that you have been carried out on the photo since the last store.
Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting editing and reproduced by selecting the menu.
If you frequently use this, you should select the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and adjust Ctrl; -switch-Z to restore.
If you press the & LMB; via the setback or restore button in the toolbar a moment more press, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions between themselves are reversed or restored.
Once you have started the photo editing, you can easily move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.
You can put in the photo and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel, or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the pop-up menu.
To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: magnifying factor automatically
View Full mode indicates the photograph in fullscreen mode. they come into the normal view, where you can use the Esc button. if you don't want this, you can call this in the dialog box of & digitifications. you can call this out of the box office. see the section for setting up the image editing.
If you want to print the current picture, you can print the image in the menu, and receive the Standard & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.
From the Main Menu, you can print single pictures or entire propositions. you can only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album. if you follow the wizard, you will only need to make your choice.
The & digitipassed; main window is on the right edge, the important information and promotions to the selected pictures. the same side bar is available without the navigation lights, even in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:
Multiple Tracks on the same rider lets the sidebar appear and disappear again in the edge.
In the inscription view, you can enter or paste the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use from other programs.
The IPTC data support only ASCII characters, and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are being cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are transformed. if you want to use the IPTC restrictions in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.
After you comments, you can either use the button Application or switch to the next picture, the inscription will then be saved.
Besides the application button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also check the metadata into files. however, this is always performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.
The review rating is an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorsions. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate more images simultaneously, select this and use the context menu.
The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. encoding follows the scheme in the following table:
The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword-tree and a select box with the previously published in this & digitilt; -session belated keyword.
The sample-tree is adjusted dynamically to the given search phrase. you can restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this capacity is particularly useful if you have many keywords.
The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering sample code at a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.
Keywords can also be set in the tree by check the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field.
If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword.
The side bar option is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, keyword and search results. if additionally one or more keyword filter is used from the right side, only the quantity of these two displayed. all selected keywords are available.
You can also draw and dismantle them. suppose you have selected several images in the main view. if the keyword has already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place on the selection. then a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword.
In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on No keywords, which is selected in the amount to three images. they were drawn up with Ctrl + a and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.
This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. you can also be disabled using settings.
If you have a rule with and created, and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this with double click on the text and control panel.
(1): the entry after which in the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.
(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.
For example, you can define an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:
If you want to group options, you just need to use the checkbox at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:
Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free storage place is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution.
This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mostly adapted to & digitised; adapted to concrete implementation.
The reason why you use a colorless workflow is that of your camera or scanner, you can achieve a predictable variance of the indeed photographed or single-called colours. with a coloured Workflow, you can achieve that the colors will be printed on your camera or scanner, or the colors that you can print or web pages from your digital darkroom.
If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it must press for the results that he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you will provide enough background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with lower information enabling you to make your own informal decisions to make you get the desired result.
If your image will meet all six criteria listed below, you don't need to take care of color management.
They work on one monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB-color space. (further information please see below)
Your only other editions are e-mail or Web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.
So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should I use another color space and have to make thoughts about colour spooles?
A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours that we can see the hugh-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.
If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.
Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the RGB space space?
Yes! if you are working in sRGB color space or not, you need to install your monitor, since sRGB works out the circle. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you have to use either your monitor on the sRGB-standard coallibriers, use a matching monitor profile or both.

This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try to try further manual processing.
The functions normalize, identical, equal and contrast, expand automatic correction from the menu, try to make the best of your colours the best. they will experiment with these effects, to see which works best at your photo.
Normalizing: this method is scaled through the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color fogging. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.
Likewise: this method is adjusted by the illuminants of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity is as flat as it is possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contradiction of the image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders at a picture or destroyed it.
Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram area.
Contrast: this method improves contrast, and luminance of the RGB values of a picture by the postpone of the lowest and highest values in the biggest area and a new jiusement of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.
The white balance of & digitipassed; is a semi-automatic tool to carry the Weißabyss of a photo.
The white-like correction is slightly limited to a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original image, areas with overexposed can occur. if you can carry the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will be better for correction.
This tool is based on a white embalm of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start the menu entry colours white balance of the image processing.
The pre-window display can be adapted in size. on the left hand, both the original image and the preview of the tool can be adjusted. if you want to see the original whitish menu again, it's enough to click on the bottom window.
The preview of the target photos features a red marker. the luminance of Pixels below this markers is indicated as vertical line in the histogram.
Right up is a histogram indicating that you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most of them have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminance.
The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve the shadow information of your photos or dimming down.
Anstat will use the above mentioned checks, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image to use the color to calculate the colour temperature of the white pattern. on this type, the temperature and green values will be automatically set.
In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:
The overexposed indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. this will display the combined score in white balance. this will appear in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.
The buttons save as and store do exactly this. each setting of the white comparison you can set in a text file and download later again.
The button preferences set all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings can be made another photograph as your original. if you store this, your original image will be changed.
Here you can set the depth of the body. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more record, calculable time, and is also available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.
This tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw photographs. it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the helmets. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can be given to the chapter color management.
Another important tool is available in the menu under color audio correction. this tool provides an integrated approach to adjust several color channels simultaneously, so that you can always make these settings the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the tonic correction you will find further information.
A very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.
The & digitization; tool color effects provides you four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.
In times of chemical processing was solar power, also called Sabatier, an effect of the image was created. the colored, dark areas protected the sensitive photopapier of the additional light. this was the effect that the brighter areas were inverted. the result was a part of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.
The intensity controls the solar power. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is possible. another increase creates a negative image that is not produced on photopapier.
This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is (1) and the revised intensity is 30%.
The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; Effect. it differs from a saturation that it has a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.
Velvia is the market name for a daylight optimized color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very satisfied colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those worn to light landscapes, too much.
The neon filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlights. in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.
Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colour contrast and luminance of photos. you can experiment with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are used.
If you have a photo at bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: this is the tool for brightness / saturation, a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing. if you like this result you can confirm the changes with Ok.
Between the complex mold gradation and the simple Leuchstarch / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. more specifically the three slider below the histogram.
The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graph, three slipones can be clicked into and the postponds can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.
The easiest way to study operation is to move the regulator and make sure the image changes.
On the right hand, the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed. preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.
Scaling: with this box box can be set if the histogram of a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is displayed. for images a digital camera is often dominating the linear histogram of a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic organization is more useful.
Three controls: the top for the dark sounds, the middle one for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium sounds, often called Gammains.
The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image, to adjust the inputs of the shadows, medium and light tones automatically. moreover, there is a knob for an fully automatic adjustment.
Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls used to change the output values as well as the output values can be used, for example, creating an easy picture as background to create for something else in the foreground.
Automatically: this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the image values of the image.
Save as and loading: with these buttons, the specified values can be stored in the file system and later reloaded, the Gimp level format is used.
If you are using this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sunflowers. check the paint pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture of the histogram for red, green, blue- and the luminance channels.
The overexposed indicator indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect to see the final result.
Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue canal of a photos. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image (2).
On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:
Modification channel: this box box allows the channel to specify the channel that is modified by the module:
In addition to this box, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera. for pictures with large areas of a constant colour, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.
For example, if you postpone a Kurventeil, for example, the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are darker with darker output string and the corresponding picture pixel are darker.
At the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value on this line, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move up and off until the value is adjusted to your flavor.
Save as and loading: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve can be created and loaded in the file system. the file format for this is the Gimp's format.
If you create this method and the three colour pipettes buttons automatically generate the curve of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun. activate the colour pipette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.
The option oversupply Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if more than one channel overexposed pixel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect to see the final result.
Below, you can see a black-and-white picture that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunflowers was set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).
The mixer of the & digitization; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color-shading of the photos.
The channel mixer is a further developed tool for mixing the colour range of images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel-Mixer of image editing.
With the channel optional, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left range of the window is showing you a preview of. the original can be viewed from their own riders.
The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram to display you the corresponding colour value.
The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. if you are able to activate luminance, this is particularly convenient if you are using the option Monochrome, since the channel Mixer opens DAS tool to create great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.
Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color appears in a visible noise, which occur of color breach. colouring is not shown in the same place in color-channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if this is the case you can enhance your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first.
The stores as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any blender settings can therefore save and then upload. the used file format is the Gimp-channel mixer format.
The overexposed indicator indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect to see the final result.
Below you can see a photo in which the blue canal was adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).
Black / white-photography was always fascinating about your abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the calculator. also with a set of movie roll profiles.

Green filters: simulates a black / white film supply with a green lens filter. this looks good in all the scene and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.
Oranje: simulates a black / white film supply with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Oranfiltered.
RotFilter: simulates a black / white film supply with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic scension effects and can simulate moon fruit to day time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) rotator.
Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film supply with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color-correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.
Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones while adding a little cold into the shadow oils. this is very similar to the process of permanent pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.
With the & digitization; tool texture may apply decorative textures to a picture.
Adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry picture texture may be used for this.
Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the view of the depth and the three-dimensional texture on the image.
A paper text-effect is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed (1) and changed (2). parameter relief is set to 200.
With the & digitization; tool frame can add a decorative frame to added a picture.
The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started out of the image processing.
Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. penetrate the picture with a colored line, niepce surrounding it with a thin line and wide frame (ideal for black and white images), encircled it with a cute three-dimensional frame. ideal for a knockout effect and decorative adds a ornamental frame with pattern added.
Width: the width of the frame is set in percent. the value for the width is 1% to 50%.
This with the frame is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.
With this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text in any single spot. this also involves several places if you need it.
This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, colour from color space and character set with its properties like you need. the bigger the picture, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.
Every attitude you chose for your text can be changed until you push the button "OK" once the picture has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.
With the & digiplug; tool templates, you can put a template on a picture.
The menu image template that can be used in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture.
For the template there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should be able to add with maximum compression (9) to simplify the file size. if you want to add an e-mail to the & digitipassed; mailing list digitization-users @ kde.org.
If you use this tool to first time, you have to put your template with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder you'll have the template. these settings will be noticed for the next start.
After the root file for the template was made, a tree view, which reflects the folder structure of the template's template. selecting a folder, the screaming panel is automatically updated.
Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.
Enlarge: this button is increased the underlying picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.
Shrinks: this button shrinks the bottom of this button. if you want to apply the mouse to the whole image, you need to reduce the image accordingly; check it with the left mouse button.
Move: use this button to postpone this button under the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.
Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the picture will then be adapted automatically by the size.
& digitipassed; sets three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.
Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.
Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture of sharper. indeed, it is not a bit, it works more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunates and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.
Refokusze is probably the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.
Photos without focus as well as most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. these are the smaller ones as the resolution are put together to form a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more powerful sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.
In JPEG image, a camera has been used for internal sharpening. images in rough-size must always be sharpened during processing.
Some scanners use a sharpness already while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.
In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening press release. you can correct them with the menu entry.
They should work with this but cautiously, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the usable technique is for sharpening the tool refus. below Refokusze you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.
Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the image a bit soft to draw. use the tool to adjust the soft sign with the menu entry. use the front page on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.
The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove seils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.
The original picture and the preview will help to edit the picture. the front window shows the output of the Filters with the current settings.
There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate good results and should be tried first. if you make the sharpest mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.
The radius represents a how many pixels hit on each side of a edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow greater radials. they should therefore sharpen images the best in its final resolution.
The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image added one of the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.
The swelling is a break from the maximum RGB-value and the difference of the difference. this way allows you to define a minimal difference between the tones of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpen and therefore beauty errors in faces, Himmler and floods are avoided.
This is an example of the unsharp masked filters. the original image is the (1) and the revised picture (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.
The & digitization; tool Refokussia focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected safety filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.
This tool tries to use a picture of & quot; refocus quot; in which it is possible to sharpening the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. it is used to use a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. Refokussic is able to use better results than impregnable. you can use it out of the menu by calling colors relocus in the image processing.
In practice the circular saw works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's fab has a very long tail, which is far from the source pixies that is far from the original quellum. the FIR Vienna Inverse is affected in most cases even very strongly from distant pixels. which causes undesirable results.
Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but should pay attention to halo notes.
Correlation: a increase in correlation can help usefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of module.
Smoking filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce Artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1, but eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a very high value will continue the picture even further.
Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter caused by an unsharpened filter. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to prevent annoying artefacts, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / oderous noise.
Match size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. an increase in the match size can produce good results, especially if you choose big values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's edge. note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.
The stores as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refusal parameter, which you have set, will be stored for later and then can be loaded.
Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity correction on the image before using the module.
Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that lots of operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts later.
If you are reading images and compress images or eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.
In general, unsharp Maskbar produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by this causing unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.
Theoretically it must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of nonsharpness. for the Vienna filters you can always show the outcome of the FIR Viennese Filters always at least as good as the Unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.
Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:
The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus liner.
For further information on the methods for sharpening agent in digital photographs, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.
The regulator is made by the sharpness of the division of the dark, to create a more natural pupil.
The colorimte allows a customized color for the pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.
The image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.
The algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.
This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:
If you want to adjust the filter settings for an adjusted, you can use your tab and advanced settings.
Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads mainly homogeneous areas of smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should get details that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details can always be subordinated to the rigation dependence.
Absorption of alpha [0,100]: a small value is smoother in all directions, while a value near to 1 is only in one direction. if you have a film grainy or CCD noise will generate a high level of wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be the best at a value near 1.
Smooth [0, 500]: this puts the maximum glitter factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. thus, set the value to the degree of noise in your image.
Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.
Repeat: there are often 1 or 2 of the algorithm. usually this is 1 or 2.
Angular stepping distance [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. be sure that small angle will produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.
Integral stepper [0,1, 10]: integral stepper in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.
Linear interpolation use: the maximum quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor. it doubles the duration of the duration. we therefore recommend it to permit him.
The buttons save as and store do exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and later reloaded again.
Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last long and a high CPU load after yourself. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the knob button.
Below you can see how image errors done with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with a analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) and corrected the correct picture below (2).
The & digitipassed; smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckel.
This tool provides chosen image filter to remove spots and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of single-called images from books or magazines.
If you require further information about sensation of digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial in English.
The screen photo above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be removed using this tool.
In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow of the advanced settings can remain with the default settings.
Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filters per pixel and can be moved through the radius covered by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs.
Sharpness: controls the sharpening level. this value is adjusted to the thickness of the filter to the front. if it is increased, noise points will be readjusted, if you may change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not get more and noise or lubrication occurs again.
Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the felt. if it is too strong, not the whole space can be removed or noise points can occur. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.
Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not influence the glass process which controls the details -settings.
Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not influence the glass process which controls the details -settings.
Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark areas, which typically are stronger, however, the shadow areas too.
Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius can appear. if it is increased, noise and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. he can remove robber and phasenjitter. he can remove robber tips and is the recommended method for this.
Save under and loading. these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for the space reduction you have set, can be stored in the file system and loaded later.
This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected (2). the noise reduction was used with default settings.
Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to sharpening the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture with the menu entry, correct and experiment with the deposit. the front window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this surgery on your photo.
The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photography file.
This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts of your images. it is very well adapted to dive into digital, original, or later digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby receives the content as it makes the human eye.
The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. text-correction is performed with another tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franníso and is part of the CImg project.
JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is not far away, in some areas it produces some Compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are displayed in uncompressed image. this attitude shall correct these problems.
The buttons save as and store do exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded again.
Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last long and a high CPU load after yourself. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.
Below, you can be restored as a photo with equestation of smoke. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the infamous film grainy on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and corrected (2).
Below, you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time textures can be read on an old color picture which was produced with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts which were created by scannerlights and photopapier. the original picture is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).
The & digitization; tool hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos using a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.
Bright, tote or hot pixel are a problem especially with high quality raw materials photos, as many cameras have JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.
This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixels quot; and "quot; luminous Pixelquot; at a picture with a dark background image method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.
Download this file into the wizard with the button dark. the tool will recognize the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image gallery.
If you have an old digital camera, it is important to you to discover new hot or light pixels through CCD defects.
First, as described in the previous section, you should find the right dark image to the correct image. notice an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note here that the assistant pays off the last dark image and again reloads this automatically at the next session.
The picture area and the preview will help you correct the result. the front window shows the output of the film with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of views.
Select an area around the defective pixels in preview and the results of the felt. select the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are the available filter:
Duration: there is an average of neighbouring pixel. it is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.
Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.
Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel.
Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban corners (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.
Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color picture with a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).
The & digitization; Vignetanimal-correction is a tool to correct the vignment, i.e., underestimated corners to correct the image.
Wide-angle lens, in particular the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vigiltierenquot; (shading) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by setting the light into the sensor there.
But it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Blenode filter, which is impossible to hold the camera with hand. wide zoom lenses should use, even with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpening effects are created by motion.
With the great exposure of modern filters and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by using a equivalent transformation in a raw material that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrection, the transformation with an Centerfilter is applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.
With three shelves, you can control the Vignetanimal-correction filters, and with three further exposure of the target image.
Density: this parameter controls the degree of light starch absorption at the point of the largest density. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of vignancy, reduce it by a small degree of compensate.
Leuchstarch, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignetratio correction reduces the luminance of the target with these options. the regulator do provide only positive values, as you just need to increase the settings.
If you want a fine adjustment of exposure of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digitization; image processing from the menu color gradation.
This is an example of the Vignetanimal correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct image in the corners and (2) the correct image has been performed in the image with this tool.
The & digitization; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.
This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.
The second degree of the second degree is the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.
The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.
The coefficient of the fourth degree is corrected the distant corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.
General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion.
Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is more powerful than in the middle of the image. for most of the lenses, the 'corners parameter has the reverse mark of the parameter General.
Zoom: this value is scaled up the image size, thereby resulting in a correction of first degree. negative values increase as positive as the image below.
Bright: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.
To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated dialogue with a preview of correction. the values you are using for your image will be stored and used as default values.
The tons or cushion-correction should be performed before all concision type or size changes. in case you perform this correction by all the first. if you want to re-cut out a picture and then make a tonne-shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong.
To help you find the best correction, this tool provides vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection, you can correct the tons / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.
If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can cut these with the cutting tool in the menu transformers from the image processing or using the zoom knob of this dialog.
For most pictures the tonne-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings from front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.
This is an example of a ton-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and corrected the image below (2).
The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website under this URL. the filters reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.
In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.
Below the preview you can set two parameters of film grainy and film sensitivity (ISO). check out the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!
Since the filter channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, since the color information is missing.
This is an example of infrared film produced on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the revised figure under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the soothills.
The & digitization; filter film grainy is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film gradients on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to enhance the sensitivity of the films to raise the manufacturer great silver liqueurs from the photoemulsion.
The film-grazing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. in case you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy views especially in your monochrome photos, so you must use this filter.
With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control of intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to be needed on ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can use the filter several times.
This is an example of film-grainy on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.
The & digitization; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses a copyright algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.
The & digitization; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.
There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. flattening controls the glasses or, from the other side, the hinges.
This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and it is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17.
The & digitization; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carboneskizers. therefore, pictures whose gradients are slowly changing, are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with them.
There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator elects the pin-size and the lower adjusted the contrast (smooth).
This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.
The & digitization; Filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.
The & digitization; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a grey, monumental landscape.
The depth allows the contrast of the filtering process. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.
This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.
This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion-effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.
Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glassles.
Step 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1, the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.
Some effects need a long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the knob button.
This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using Unsharpens effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.
Zoom imsharpness: wipe out the image along the steep lines that go out from a center. this simulates a zoomous camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.
Radial imsharpness: wiped the picture through rotation of the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the sharpest of a rotating camera.
Distance of distances: wiping the picture around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear in the background.
Movement-sharpness: wirelates the picture through horizontal movements of pixel. this simulates the sharpest of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.
Soft draw sharpness: wiped the picture soft into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add to a warm and subtle light.
Schüttelimsharks: wipe out the picture through random shift of pixel and simulates the sharpest of a moving camera.
Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paint tank in the picture and realises them without changing the rest.
Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average pixel value.
Some effects need a long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.
The drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this makes it natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.
Drop-size allows the size of drips to change. since the drop-size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size of small images. number of fish changes the optical effect of drops on the image.
You can keep using the & digiplug; image editing a range of shelves. use the selection tool to stay the area, e.g. a face that will remain vacant. if you then start the filter shelf drops, the area will remain vacant.
This is an example of the Regentroprops Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the revised picture (2) indicates a sunset from a storm. the default values were used for this example.
If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirror or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformers threaten and transformers mirrors.
Foto: bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with minimal loss of image quality.
A picture to shrinkers is simple. the big question is how can you get a picture bubbles and how can you find out in a picture? how can you find the missing information again? how can we find the missing information again? how can you see the missing information here? how can we see it and you will see it yourself.
If a photo is the wrong size, you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. select transformers change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.
The tool for size can change a linear interpolation method to increase the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.
Many educational programs use a kind of interaction, i.e. spline interpolation to enlarge of the image. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.
You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new tab and are listed below:
Maintain side ratio: when this setting is activated, the new size will keep the aspect ratio of the original image.
Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.
The buttons feed as and loading are used exactly. each entry for photo is saved as text file, and later reloaded again.
Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after yourself. you can break the calculation at any time with the button Finish.
You can see an example for photo inflating, by adding a small color image onto the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the result (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.
The cut of a photo is not only a widely performed surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a photo. to cut a photo with the mouse, press the mouse button and pull up the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle then while using the mouse.
When you get rid of the mouse button, the field of photos will be cut off. through this, you can change a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting edge. you can easily create the size of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create you simply with the left mouse button.
As soon as you are satisfied with the access button, use the knob button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or file saving under the menu to save the newly added photo.
In the area, you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog, will be preserved.
In accordance with aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of height and width-format is assigned to width.
The tool is cutting edge ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you can use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and its aspect ratio.
At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to choose from the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.
Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.
The tool is based on aspect ratio. if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are contained in the cut picture, and not the original image.
The settings of the coaster help allow help to induce you to put your pictures better. these help are:
Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elbows, harmonic triangles are a possibility to have a rectangle towards the diagonal triangles.
Golden middle: the golden centre is a dividing to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the petals of a Sunflower. it emerges in all sorts of things that we find as beautiful.
The golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and you've already used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.
The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two numbers. the resulting division is 1: 1,618 the golden centre. a composition which is usually considered visually harmonious.
The golden centre provides liquidity relief lines if you put a picture below: these help are listed below:
The golden spiral will bring your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to third level, the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spirals and creates a symmetrical visual stream.
Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. it should give something that the eye is at the heart of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.
The Golden triangles are also located on the top of the golden corner. their failure points are the middle points of the golden rectangles. in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equilous triangles. diagonal to these lines can be used on a static object.
If you are using golden triangles to break your framework a effect of professional photographers of dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you can't achieve differently.
The Horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious part.
With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.
The Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle.
If you do a photo, it's easy to keep the camera straight vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image editing and tool free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target angle.
Turn your picture with the sliding angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button preferences you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on top.
To help your help, the Free rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing to the two lines. after setting it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.
After you have shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transformers cutting out of the image processing.
An elegant way to cut the image is automatical cutting. select one of the following options:
The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.
All perseverance transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.
To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that help you change the perspective:
New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that were created through the transformation, in pixels.
New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that were created through the transformation, in pixels.
Angle left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformer territory.
Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformer territory.
Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformer territory.
Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformer territory.
After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit mapped. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.
After you've adapted the perspective, you get unjoyous triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to bersome is to cut it into the image with transformers from the image processing.
The tool is used to move a part of the picture into a direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transforming scissors.
Make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on default, the angle will appear to zero. a preview of the target will display you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right.
To your help, vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.
After having carried out the scissors, the image becomes a bit wiped. for a single coating, this effect is usually negligible, but two chasing is doubtful and therefore you should avoid this.
After crossing the picture, the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate it is the image of transforming cutting out of the image processing.
& digitipassed; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats, therefore, depending on your system and, in some cases, from the type like this libraries compile. in most distributions, you will be able to process a large number of image formats with & digitization;
Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all file formats on their system. however, they will always be able to JPEG and TIFF to them below.
& digitipassed; shows only files in formats that knows. this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can change this list of file extensions. you can change further information here.
Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras may even allow you to select the format. a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digitised; supports both formats.
Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way.
JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also be saved if this is specified in the settings.
If you want to learn more about the raw screen format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert red format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw converter of & digitized; you can find further information about the use of modules with & digitipassed;.
& digitipassed; supports the shop of raw pictures only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digitization; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats used by & digitization; supported by:
Many digital cameras support the recording short films. these clips are often stored in the AVI- or MPEG format; but if you click on a movie file, & digitipassed; if you click on a movie file, & digitipassed; the & KDE; settings to play movies use to play the program to playback.

Starts the same metadata between the database and all files, so not only those in the current view as with this menu. the metadata bank will be overwritten by the data of files at deviations. the other variant can be launched from the menu album.
All configured cameras will be listed here. you can add the entry camera to add a new camera to add a new camera. please check in the camera set up further information.
KIPI module enables a range of images exported to a KML structure. KML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth's Earth.
If you change steps 4 and 5, what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good, then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white.
Many tools which you need the photo editing are included in & digitization; included. their description follows here.
All image processing tools such as sharpening, plussar, noise reduction, relocating, unsharp masked, & etc;. use a uniform dialogue which indicates the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture Applicable quot; in this dialogue:
(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of him, five buttons allow the comparative mode of the screened area. these modes are:
Vertically, without duplicat. the left area shows the original and the right hand demonstrates the filter to the right of the selected lecture area.
Horizontally, without duplicat. the upper section shows the original and the lower part demonstrates the filter to the area below the selected lecture area.
Vertically divide vertically. the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter.
Horizontally divide horizontally. the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter.
'mouse over 'style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the area and otherwise the original.
(2): there are two buttons you can switch on to show over- and subexposure. the used colours can be adapted in the general configuration page.
(3): the context of a preview of Preview. you can view this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the picture you want to see diepreview. preview the link part of the dialog will be updated immediately.
(5): in the left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all inserts from the last use of module will be noticed.
The sidebar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely declared itself. it is grouped in the following sections:
Photofeatures: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data are from the EXIF data, if these are available.
This rider provides an intuitive map material based on the Marble-Miniature. press Ctrl; left mouse buttonpot to pull a square. press Ctrl; left mouse buttoned to pull a square. all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is naturally occurring your images Geo-data.
& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallets files. the application can be used to edit color palm, and select and renaming colours.
The pallets files that are installed by & KDE; can either apply to the whole system or only a user. in the latter case they are found in your personal file for & KDE; -settings and hot user defined color, and last used colours.
In the range, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder after files.
The cursor is displayed in the pallet view as line. it can be moved by clicked on the area next to a color.
It shows on the colour next to the colour. the colour is described under the pallet view. here, the color name can be changed.
It can also be used to choose from. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor there. afterwards, move the mouse with pressed linker mouse button.
If the checkbox is inserted under the button color, the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrite a different; depending on whether the mode is overwriting. this mode allows you to select by selecting the checkbox under both cursor.
A selection that produces as described in the last section, can be used together with the actions copy, cutting and paste.
& kcoloredit; used the following format for data in clipboard: for each color three values for the shares of red, green and blue and an optional colour name, followed by a line character, if there are three numerical values in the clipboard, these can be inserted as one color in & kcoloredit;
The colors in the range and output of colour selection can be pulled with the mouse.
Select one color somewhere on the screen and then you can find it in the colors on the left.
& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing of & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. these programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, particularly in computer science; and so far, there was no modern & GUI; here, the programmes, the & graphviz; included, are outdated view of the program author and X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with only few functions.
The & kgraphic viewer; project set itself the target to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of an integrated & KDE; program.
& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graphen; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviewer; shows Graphene with all the possibilities of an integrated & KDE; program in a modern and user friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:
Integration into & Kate; and & Konqueror; (so that a change in Graphene in & Kate; the Graphene is calculated and contained in & graph)
To open the Graphene in & Kate; to open the Graphene in & Kgraph; in one & Kate; component to open
Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to present more than this node)
Further required software: & graph interviewer; is a & KDE; program which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the presentation of graphs required. needed in detail:
The main window displays the opened graph, each in one own underwindow. at the beginning, when you start & kgraphviewer. in this case, the tool bar will open only the icon file and the (empty) list added files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.
After selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:
As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.
Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at the pressing & Alt; -key);
The zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.
If the just in & kgraphviewer; loaded file has been changed from another program, the following window is displayed:
You can choose whether the graph is to be loaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision later, so later you can change your decision later, you can set up the menu item atgraphviewer; set up... use, see also.
If you open a graph outside of a current & kgraphviewer; opening, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; opening instance, or want to visualize the present instance.
As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but can change it with the setup dialog.
At the program start you can open all the rollers of your last session again. again, you can store your choice both as well as later.
You can also specify how the graph is to be broken up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.
If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which are on one side, should be set on this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graphite.
Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphite without head line and with another font
The site again returns the possibility to determine the behavior when one file has changed on the hard drive; eg; from another program. you can setup a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore any changes) or leave the program every time.
The site is open the opportunity to determine the behavior of & kgraphviewer; determine if a Graph open outside a current session. you can open a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window, or at a lower window of the already running session) or determine that every time is required.
The site seating management provides the opportunity to determine the start-behavior of & kgraphviewer; specify the default behavior (open files at the last session or not), or determine, at any start.
The context menu that usually comes with a click on the main window with the & RMBn; offers further possibilities:
Here you can select below various & graphic; -layouts algorithm. the entries, as they are described on the website of & graphviz; are:
& dot; -algorithm, the standard for grated graphs. the algorithm calculates the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce short edges and as a few edge flashing.
The & neato; -algorithm is the standard for unfinished graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. this is used by Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is synonymous with statistical-dimensional scaling.
The & FDP; -algorithm creates a springray model layout. it uses the Fruity-Reingold-Heuristics, and includes a plitter for the treatment of large and clustered Graphene.
The & circo; algorithm sets the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.
Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell, and the calculated layout of graphite after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms special options, or modify the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.
Specifies the type of graphs (addressed or unprocessed) and applies to the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for curated, & neato; for unged Graphene).
If this adjustment is activated, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.
Showing the What is the -mouse pointing. click with this mouse pointing to a & GUI; -ELEMENT to get additional help to this element (if available).
A list of changes is available at this address and in the file Changelog in the base folder of the source archive.
& kgraphic viewer; is a & KDE; -program that uses & graphviz; -tools to the representation. it requires the following program packages:
A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphviewer; to use. in the menu settings, you will find further options.
The main window of the icon is divided into five areas: the main tool bar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid-grid, in which you draw the symbol.
Creates a new symbol. if the current file has been changed, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. afterwards, a dialog can be created if the symbol is to be created by a presentation, or if you want to start new.
To reverse the final step back again. if you do not have a step reversed, this function is disabled.
Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new picture (if the clipboard contains a symbol).
Sets the current symbol in grey scales. this can create colors that do not match the symbol range of & KDE; match.
Does not change the symbol, but sets the current color on the color of the point you click.
The status bar shows you the current actions. from left to right, it shows you the x- and y-coordinates of the current Pixels, the size of the current drawing area, the magnification factor and the current number of colours of the symbol.
Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new picture (if the clipboard contains a symbol).
Please set up a dialog with the three-page Templates for symbols, background and symbols.
Add the buttons..., edit... and remove the Templates for Standard File, Source File, Compressed File & etc.
Select Transparent pixels or display Lineals and display colors as Transparency display. you can also choose the size: the Caros on small, medium and large set as well as the color 1: and color 2: select.
The KIPI module includes tools available to read new pictures and enrich them.
This module can be used to read and add new pictures to read external sources. currently, two sources can be used:
Scan: uses the Kooka Interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports through the sane project, or another source such as Video streams. this makes you have to have Kooka and sane installed.
When you scan the menu entry images, a dialog you can select between all available sources on your machine. select here the source of which you want to get the image. you can also use the default source for the next time.
After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default value ducer's own default, in order to select your image correspondingly. see the picture below. the estimated file size will show you in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.
Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings will not be displayed.
After you have pressed the button, you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to capture the options of the image file. please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files. you also need to create the folder & # 160; select or create the image.
Screen photos can be made after you have selected in the menu of Importier- > On-screen menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:
Select the complete screen, read in order to read a single window under the mouse.
If all of your own program windows are chosen, the calling program will disappear, so that you can read other screens and windows. otherwise, you'll read the entire desktop reading, only read the window under the mouse.
The delay determines how long screen photo will wait before it starts. if you have to switch on other working spaces, you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate.
After the screenshot is made, dialog options of the target image with the options described above.

Flickr is an online photo development on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to show its photos to people who are important. you can show up your favorite photos of the world to show the photos of your camera products and show your photos safely and private your friends and family around the world.
The module export to Flickr can also be used to upload photos from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.
If you are using the module for the first time you will run through the process of generating a token. this is basically a way to Flickr. a browser is started to register with Flickr.
After successful login, the module can send pictures to Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.
Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.
If the module comes to Flickr on the second time, you will welcome you with the following dialog, which shows the current access calculations.This module is currently not required any other permissions. you are asked if you want to continue with these permissions.
The button photos should be pressed once after you have all other options. with this button you can instantly upload the photos you want to upload. when you press the Ok button, upload photos to the Flickr server.
The field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these will be added to the image as keywords.
With the options Close, Friends and Famillie you can adjust the access authorizations to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.
If you choose to upload the size of the photos prior to the high load, the photos are changed before high load in size. the size is taken from the maximum size of the maximum size.
The maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of images. size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.
The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
The KIPI module is currently not documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI team at KDE-imaging @ kde.or. attention: participants of this list speak English.
The KIPI module for geographical location allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and to process the geographical data in the EXIF sample of the image and localization may be displayed in a map in an external browser.
The KIPI module for geographical location provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude will be used.
To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.
Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track.
Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window, and call the menu. to guide a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a backup file with GPX file. this file contains data which were recorded at the same places as the images of your camera.
If the file is loaded a automatic correlation, which shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera age must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera area here.
The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. lies the deviation among them, the maximum value is 2000 seconds.
If you don't have any jumps from one place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all pictures in this area.
The options interpolishing and difference in minutes may be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a locating in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and then push the button correlate to the interpolishing.
The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next you will only use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.
The location can also be found according to the displayed map and increase sie.Perform this again through, until you have reached an increasing accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite screen and a mixed mode.
Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hanging the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data.
The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums using HTML pages.
This module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums available as HTML pages and select the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.
The module has four riders in which settings can be adapted to the tab. they will only select all the albums. the albums will not select hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenchschau and the text which will appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.
The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely declared itself. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed on each image. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed
The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your image files. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything, will be created there.
If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.
With other color depth you can change the default color depth. it also affects the file size. all other settings are elusive.
The rider Vorumbnails allow you some of the settings from the album rider for the screwing images, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.
A progress window displays the user as far the action is. press abort to break the process.
If the module has created pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occur during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to show the preview of the gallery. press Schzy to close the module.
The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.
The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images, and perform basic operations like filming, zooming, or merge. the viewer can be used with short-performance and lengthy. it was developed for a fast picture display and quick access to its functions.
After the start, a picture will be displayed in fullscreen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.
The KIPI JPEG loss-free module is a tool to change images without any of your quality.
This module allows to store images in JPEG format, without storing the usual losses on quality or metadata.
The consequence of loss-free storage is the file size, as no compressing of color information is taking place. for example, you can find at the PNG format.
The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera.
The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI team at KDE-imaging @ kde.or. attention: participants of this list speak English.
The KIPI module metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the KDE-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.
With the Import feature of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then choose the image that you want to copy the file extensions with which you want to copy the file screen, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data is copied after you're buttoned on the button OK.
This function is not working with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.
The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a range of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show.
The module MPEG Kodiver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the diashau.
All images will be scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can choose a background colour for the diashau. in addition, this module is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program for burning.
First you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG gashau. afterwards, you can launch the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.
Images selected from you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change grading images or contents of the list.
After you're satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.
In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of picture output is defined by it. a low value produces very sudden, a high on the contrary, very smooth changes.
The background color can be set next. in doubt you should make it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set by name of the MPEG-output file. if possible, keep mpg as possible as possible.
If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, you can add your wishes to the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the gashau when you are back again.
If a hint appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.
The printing assistant enables several images to print on a paper together in standard images. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sense to improve or print them with the Gimp module for direct expression.
With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your files stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.
The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get more dcraw better results!.
First, choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw-Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings to the image.
You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be adjusted for white periods. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.
A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.
Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same, and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and manufactures for the smallest file sizes.
The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.
In case you want to edit your images frequently or later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.
If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.
If you have adapted your settings, you can start with the exit knob. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.
The stacking device mode allows you to convert different pictures to once. use this mode so if you are safe, e.g. through testing on a single image, which are the best settings.
The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have here the possibility of existing file automatically. this is helpful if this has been created in a previous attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.
This module can be used to press all pictures in a album. it uses the program with the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:
This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, start number and timestamp of the record.
This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a video collection. it uses this program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image below or enlarge. there are four types of image change available:
Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be selected depending on the orientation orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.
Proportional (2 Dim.): size of size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to the screen size.
Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.
Printer preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print solution and size of the photo printer. the target image, including background size, edge size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.
With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the cast images previously. more pictures can drag and down to the list of sened pictures.
After you started the module, the pictures window with the photos of you will be shown. you can add more images with a file extensions dialog. for the last selected image will display a preview on the right page.
You can also drag images to the image list and then add them to the list of senseling pictures.
The button pictures will remove the selected pictures from the list of selected pictures.
After you have selected all pictures, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the images are already attached as an appendix.
Make sure not send to many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.
The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is stored and always used until you change it.
Choose your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field.
If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmailing agent on your computer. you can download this here.
After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the pictures into a text file and attached to the mail.
The PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not appropriate to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.
If you are choosing JPEG under images file format and select the original files in JPEG format, then the original file data will be added to sened pictures.
When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed that you can see the status messages, looking for mistakes, view. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button cupboard you can lie this window? en.
After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions such as you want to have shown your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.
The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation will use very elegant images via OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the dipping will be very slow.
The file name's file name ensures that the file name of the pictures in the left corner is displayed during the presentation.
The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then turn off manually with Esc.
The option pictures are randomly chosen to see the images displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.
Among the delay between the pictures can be set at the time distance between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should be able to show you the presentation of your friends!
There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly chosen a different effect between the pictures.
During Diaschau you can access a toolbar on the upper left screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch.
With this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start again, to the previous and next picture jump and stop the gashau.
On the left, you can see the current filenames, the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation.

The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the user surface.
This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenus, as background for your KDE work surface.
Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & photo album; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the picture, now in each group, so in persons, places and in group keyword entries are present.
In your browser window you see the categories that you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look at the EXIF-based information, look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current role models.
When you press the mouse on the entry, the browser's view is changing. see picture.
If you select another person, only the pictures are shown on which both persons can be seen. by this selective method you can limit the number of displayed images of a few thousand pictures to some single images.
If you have selected all the characters, places and other settings, you can view images to view the images of your efficiencies.
In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. however, you can save with & photo album; however, for each person a self-looking picture, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined. see the picture.
To view images next to the name, choose the button, which you can choose from the right outside on the toolbar. in the published context menu, you can select what you can view the view for each category. in the published context menu, you can view a list of words with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keyword words (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keyword).
However, you need to define the image for each individual person. to view this, you'll need to view the picture-angled window (described in closer) and select the text editor, as shown in the picture. you can select the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be displayed and cut.
If you are searching for the entry into the main window, a dialog will be displayed, which is very similar to dialog for the fixed-of-the-art properties. you can see this dialogue once again.
If you want to enter a string in the box or description, the labels will be searched and descriptions of the pictures following this text. if you want, you can also be able to enter a date, i.e. for example, 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.
With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all pictures after certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, on which Jesper, not Anne Helene are depicted.
This is the user manual for & photo album;. if you don't like to read manuals but rather have to try the following functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:
Go to the webpage of & photo album; and look at the quick-speed, screen photos and the introductory videos.
Start & buy photo album; and select in the first dialog box, if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select the menu entry into the menu entry into photo album; -Demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try out the functions of & photo album.
If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the webpage of & photo album; as an associated HTML document to download.
At the bottom edge of the main station of & photo album; see the timeline. a picture of the bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this cuff shows you data about the pictures in your database.
The timeline can show you several different time units. every bar shows then a different unit. you can change between units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing up only 10 minutes sections.
The timeline you can interactively use the following ways: you can change the displayed entries look from the database (if you select a date, you will always show the actual picture of this date in preview-Andes) and the timeline will always show the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.
You can also select a range of the timeline by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time numerical, pulling in the preview view only pictures of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.
& photo album; you can create two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures. the one is in & photo album; integrated and the other as module is available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the integrated version is described, which you can create HTML...
Before HTML pages have to be created, you must propose some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout, and goal. in the following, each field is described more accurately.
First, enter the title of the superstructure and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photo album; HTML example, see an example for this settings.
Next, select if you choose a photo album; the export file is to be seen on the reviews page. nourishing information about export files you will find in.
Lastly, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. for example, you can avoid that information is shown in the viewer. for example, that all images are exported. therefore, you can't use this setting to hide specific images from certain considerations.
In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the site possibilities are clearly, which is why not made in particular.
Bottom of the page you can set various resolutions on the images. this allows you to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, not download images, for example, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.
The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if he wants a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.
In this area of production, place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored.
Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each successive sentence a new subfolder.
First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:
After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all listed for viewer. if you choose the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, can start here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong file.
In the case that the HTML files are not yet available in the final destination, you need to copy it manually. thus, the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolder are located.
The application options described above have all three on base folder and URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you specify in the output file.
In case you are looking at a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; you can, of course, want to write an HTML page to viewing the images. if you're looking forward to check out the image information, guests on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & photo album; this work will not even be done once.
With & photo album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import others in your database. the image features are ex- and imported.
There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it, whether the images are stored in the file, or whether in the file there is only a link to save images, that you may have all the images together and give this file so independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.
You can export a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.
An external .kim file searches the pictures in two times. first, the images of the URL, which are indicated in the file of .kin file, are searched for the images of URL that you have created using the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via the HTML export.
In the following, dialogue for Export image will be described, which you export via the File menu.
The most important option for this dialogue is whether it is to act in internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection possibilities:
When using the Manuell option to the .kim file, you will need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim file.
With the option, copy the .kim file, copy & photoAlbum; the pictures automatically for you.
.kim files are regular Zip files. since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it usually is not able to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the option Export file.
The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send your friends images, you might want to limit the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would be very large. here you can say that each image should be 800 pixels high and broad.
When you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file... select, will import & photo album; the exported database as described in described.
The assistant to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which file the import images are supposed to be copied.
It may be that you are personating the category individuals to import file personer (if you are a Dane) while this category is asked for your database people. this is why you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported from the categories that are displayed in your database.
In the fourth step, you can proceed to the categories of imported files with the categories of your current database. for example, you see the image.
It must be easy to browse and watch images: when you see pictures, you want to view images within different picture groups & mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.
In this manual you will run the different steps of (1) fixed the information about your images, via (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.
KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it will talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.
& photo album; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal securing tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.
& photo album; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future Starts again. if you want to read another folder in & photo album, you can start & photo album; with the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.
To set up the menu entry into photo album; set up a window with which you can change the attitudes of & photoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual you will be explained the different installation possibilities.
To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call on site possibilities and options for the viewer. for every setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 button and click on the desired option.
It has been described in you how to create different properties, such as persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.
See the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labeling and a symbol.
In the section, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set complete assembly groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of grouping all groups of a central glimpeds.
In view of the application options that are available to you in the list of members. with the top selection list you can choose the category. in the left window, you can find a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.
& photo album, with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. nourishing information can be found on the site of Kipi.
The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can be described and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help page that you can call for the modules themselves.
Since the modules are used together with multiple applications, it may be that the modules have been tested using the demo database, before you can call them on your own photos. demo database can be found either via the command line with the command > photo album demo < userinput\ > or over the menu help. don't say, I would not have warned you!
The applications that use the modules over KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage of when you share functions with different applications.
The largest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications do not support their pictures into albums: this type of order not supported, simulates it for some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with & photo album.
In doing so, simulates & photoAlbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, shows all pictures that are currently showing the picture of the picture.
In addition to the current album & photo album, the modules also need to pass a list of albums. here goes as well as photoalbums; as follows:
If & photo album; s browser indicates the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.
Or the category, which you have set in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums, is used, for example, if you want to choose the category, so if you select persons on the view and give the module further.
Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog dialog, and select the modules, which modules should be loaded.
On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start & photo album; with your own pictures.
As you are used from any other KDE application, you can see the window as well as you can browse your image database. at the moment, you will not find any information about your pictures. in the section, we will see you on this window, but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview of all existing images.
One of the main features of & photo album; is the opportunity to see each image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the picture has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images, either individually or for a larger number of images. if, for example, on all images Jesper is shown and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.
All these notes can be used for searching and browses as you can read in section. if you want to see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.
In view three lists with a text box by setting up persons, places and keyword. these are a very important part of & photo album; as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures.
The following idea is to move inside the pictures inside the list: if you are depicted a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can see that the names are shifted downwards, finding the people faster and assigned them.
If you prefer to select a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting according to date below.
If you have selected comments for each image, you might need to edit any selected pictures and provided these pictures with notes. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located below the picture of the picture right up.
If you have several pictures, for example with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu point multiple entries once using a note.
Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. moreover San Francisco and Los Angeles in California are located.
In the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a transgroup, a special symbol is displayed.
In the context menu of the Comment it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new transition or subcategory. additionally, you can also make an entry to an existing or subcategory. attention, this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabetically. see this.
You can shift the individual elements of the dialog link by clicking and postpone the edges of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make a window as part of the window area.
If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you click on the button options..., which allows you to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.
You can also send a frame as well. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and then you can see a window. this process can be seen in the picture.
If you select the entry images in your browser, you will receive an overview of viewing images from currently selected pictures, or all the pictures you don't have any filters. for example, you can configure the size of the umbnails, by simply downwards using the mouse button. try it simply.
If you want a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as background image for your desktop.
If you click on a picture, this picture viewer will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window open with an image viewer, a new display window is created.
You can also delete pictures from the image in the image. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Removing button or select the edit menu. now, you will see the window displayed in the picture.
& photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the images stored on the hard disk. in the picture you'll need to record the pictures anywhere, so you can view the view from & photo album; in the picture you can view the view from & photo album; if not all the necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.
Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9, however, the preview can be viewed, so & photo album can show you the preview of this pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer.
As you see, this function takes you out and copying files from the folders. if you still don't want to avoid the insertion of the question CD until now, please download a larger hard disk to store all the pictures.
In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, you filter the pictures so that you can see for other inaccessible and click in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also see all pictures you can see your little sister, contests and select the menu entry.
That you have set the images that should be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister, then select all the pictures you have locked out can be hatched. if you want to see the pictures again, click on lock.
It is also possible to determine a password, which needs to be unlock the pictures. to create this password, you simply select password change in the menu.
Please consider that this picture protection is not very secure. for example, you can read or delete all pictures on the file index.xml, you can read the password as the unturnkey text, or delete this type of password protection. this type of password protection is not very familiar with those who are acting with & photo album; not very familiar with sight to private pictures.
The reason why you want to watch all your pictures with & photo album; managing and write hours over hours so you want to look at some point. for this reason it has a photo album and watch video viewer. this can be seen from preview, as described in.
The viewer you can see in. he shows of course the picture, but additional all the information you have about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.
If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if all these options are available after a right click on the viewer you can see below.
Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you select persons from your browser and then Anne Helene would have chosen.
If you have several images loaded in the viewer you can go down between them and go back by using the keys image and jump. you can go to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions are also available from the context menu.
If several images are loaded in the viewer you can run this as a slide. then a new picture will be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus respectively Minus by pressing the Ctrl key; S and then it will be stopped.
A very useful capacity to check out & photo album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry button to change in full screen mode and back.
If you are using the viewer you can easily pull out in the picture. zoom in the painting can easily pull out a rectangle. with the Minus button, you can print out the Plus button zoomt into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of zooms.
With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the principle key puts the zooms so that each pixel is equal to a pixel screen.
Note that the only Zoomoperations work with videos that are in and out out with the Plus- and Minosts.
With the Context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes about the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.
If you can see images, you'll find a picture of a person whose name you will have forgotten on the image. at the moment you can view the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to mark these names. but you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and look for more pictures.
Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start viewing with the pictures and check them as good or bad, while you are looking for one another.
For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch features with features, while you are viewing. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.
As soon as you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. if you are all able to edit, print or select what you can always choose to do with comments. this is described in. afterwards, you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do.
Categories and especially characteristics can be shown in the preview view. if you are able to view categories in DRE preview, then you can simply push the characters for the traits once the picture was chosen. this can be seen here:
Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. this case allows you to paint & photo album; on the picture.
The mold won't be saved with the image but in the database. on the way you can reverse it later.
In this picture you can see a painting on the painted image. in order to switch the painting of the context menu, choose the picture out of the context menu. to finish the painting, you simply press the cross in the toolbar above on the window.
To work with & kpovmodeler; work, you need to rule the application of the program & Povray; not complete, but the documentation to & Povray; should not be read and understood.
In the object-tree you can choose individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and displayed the object in the wire model.
You can also select several objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects already are selected with the object.
To add a new object in the object tree, choose the position where you want to add the object and click either onto the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu.
If there are possible positions, the following drop-up menu will be phased, so that you can choose the right position:
To remove either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can previously remove selected objects from the scene.
If you have changed features, click on Apply to adopt these changes. if you have invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can incorrect the input and click on application or cancel the changes.
If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.
You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.
If you process a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview of the Own View.
Press on a preview of Your Own view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. if you want to rendering a subordinated item, even if you want to rendering a subordinated item (for example, one texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross it locally.
Screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can pull these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.
If a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross indicates the center for scaling and rotting as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling through the mouse inside the window.
Each object has a display model as a wire model. you can only specify this value relatively to the visible level of the above-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visible stage smaller or equal to the scene of the same visual stage of the scene.
& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and the view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.
If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it any. you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different orders.
To anchor a window above or below, drag the anchor to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.
To create a new column, drag the connection to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view, stretching across the entire height.
If you wish to classify several views over each other, drag the anchor in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views of clicking on the menu navigation on top of the views.
The last possible window rules are floating views: views that are not in the main window. to solve a view out of the anchoring, drag the anchor on the screen or click on the small one to the left top right arrow in the edge bar.
To close a view, click on the small cross in the Compreamp bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.
You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are shy, you can anchor them at any point.
The current window view can be saved with window support... store. it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window system under an existing or new name.
If you have created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be correctly installed. when this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.
To rendering the current scene, click on the symbol Rendering the symbol rendering in the tool bar or select the menu entry page.
A Render-mode correspond to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can get any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of maximum quality.
If you click on the symbol The Render (click on the toolbar) or in the menu View Render Modi... choose the following dialog:
Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode.
In the size card size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to rendering only one small area of the image, select the section section and give the image section to rendering in input fields.
In combination field quality, you can select the features that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. an exhaustive description of Render properties can be found in the user manual & Povray;.
If a picture is framed with only a beam of pixels, different errors can be created. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or stuffing effects in corners and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is Aliens.
& Povray; uses an anti-aliasing technique to reduce the influence of these mistakes. in general, pictures are better seen with this feature.
If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculated and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.
& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is continuously split up and adaptive because each pixel depends on and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated colour values.
When you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color value is exceeded, both pixels are calculated by the pursuit of a specific number of pixels with super sampling, then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a low-value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.
The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue. the difference is then:
Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)
The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color value exceeds the pre-given threshold, then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, and the maximum depth is checked, and the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the depth value.
Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of space for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.
The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that is calculated by diffuse light-reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.
On this card card you can adjust whether the alpha-channels are to be charged by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays are not made an object.
Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.
To import a & Povray; -scene, select the menu entry file... and select a file from the dialog window.
Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command-scale of & Povray;. when importing troubleshooting or warnings, a dialogue window displays a list of all messages.
If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.
You can drag objects from the object-tree to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code in the text file into the Editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object-tree.
With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.
The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene is running. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.
If you click on the Help button, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your documentation and version. it supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.
& Povray; search for external files (for example, allocates) into the path to the & Povray; libraries. if you enter files that are not in the file's file, you'll also need the path to these files here. if a file is found in various paths of the library, the first found file is used.
Colour for the wireless model. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.
The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.
The color of the rectangle for viewing in the camera view and in the window-type license.
You can set the object of points on the push-button in the context menu of the wire model view. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotation.
Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better proximity to the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set up the detail level for two directions.
If you cross high detail details for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature adds a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.
When you cross wall, a wall is displayed behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.
When you cross the bottom, a soil is displayed below the objects. the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.
If you turn to edge funds, non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.
On this page you can change existing windowments or create new window orders. in the window orders, it is explained how to create and store window orders.
The combination field standard window system: shows all existing windowments. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window order to start the program.
The list of pre-handcrafted window orders shows all existing windowments. a new arrangement can add to the button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.
Every window of window is identified by the name. the name needs to be unique and must not be empty.
The list below the name shows all views on the chosen window system. new views can add to the button add and delete selected views with the button.
The location of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unts, you get a map image with the previous window, with card card, you do not create a window view, but not in the main window, but creates a separate window.
So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should very popular the ultimate but easy scene, among beginners: a ball at a level.
But you should notice the following warnings carefully before you make sure that you are using only one black screen. if you use a 3D program to first time, you should notice these important rules:
If you do not adjust the camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.
If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.
If you have everything faultless installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following preset box order:
Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.
You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications.
& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry process. so you will now have a scene without objects.
The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you produce. in particular, you notice that in the fourth-wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.
The object-tree now includes a new entry with the name of camera. if you click on it, you see the content of the view layout, where the different parameters of the camera can find. in the user documentation to & Povray; please find further details.
Change nothing at the basic settings of the camera, but you notice that the camera can change in view of the camera, with which you can change the camera in view. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired spot.
If you push the button Application or ONE BEABETASTE, change the wire model views and the object-tree immediately accordingly. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.
There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a receipt (insert endless body quantum) and the size at x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a reversal method for a solution to this task.
& kpovmodeler; indeed offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane than the floor:
A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Application or ONE BEABETASTE. the new name is displayed immediately.
The wire model view is also showing the level also, if at the moment only a limited space level. if you rendering the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.
When you look at the object-tree, you will notice that you can click the entry + before the object. in this case you can see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the list of object properties.
In this scene, you should shift the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only so you can get some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:
Only select the floor to hire its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something special at the moment.
In both cases a dialog will open in which you can select what the object is supposed to be inserted. please choose the name in the object-tree. you can change the name in the self-economy (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks like now.
Of course, the preview of Pigments only have a Mattes black material because you need to check settings for the pigment. therefore, you can always remember the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the simplest.
If you don't see a color on quad and sphere, click on the button Application and then call the preview.
The material for the floor is now properly set. if you rendering your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:
Of course, this is not the color. you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need two new attributes. then, select this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the box-color list may only be used with two colours):
In the object-tree every time is monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics:
This step you should already run out, as you can already understand the basic work of & kpovmodelers; already understood. the sphere is just as easy as the floor can create:
In the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to press ONE BEABETASTE or the button to press), so that the sphere hit over the ground, because you have moved the ground around a unit downwards.
Of course, the Rendering is now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball-surface looks like a Mattes black material. put in the following step a suitable material.
If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material right now. as in the ground, enter the sphere of a pigment as a color:
Select replacement object and change the name for example in the pigment. click on the pigment, then dial in-color and set the values as follows:
But you can achieve more interesting effects, if you take time, make some finish characteristics:
Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or push the ONE BEABETASTE.
The settings of shine-effect and reflection is already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not chosen:
You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler. hopefully, you've already learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.
Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.
If you raytracting a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel's perspective, reflecting the visual effects of light sources in the scene and, like atmospheric effects, such as fog. this is how the scene pixels for pixels is processed.
As you can imagine, you will see no camera without any camera you see the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.
In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.
Opens a file. in the default dialog dialog, you can select a file before using & kpovmodeling; created
Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replace the oldest record in the list.
If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it's a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.
The scene is reproduced in the last saved version. any changes since the last store are rejected.
This menu entry can only then select if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.
Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry is only then selected if you have using editing.
Store the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.
In this menu, you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeling;, here you can change the appearance, the keys and the default behavior.
Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add this option to default for & kpovmodeler; commands or add new commands.
Opens a dialog to the setup of the tool bar. you can add and remove the toolbar option for & kpovmodeling; -commands add and remove.
A bump-map is an option to suggest rough surfaces without any diffusion on the surface and change without the geometrical form of the object itself.
It is customary to use the same file either for a bump-Map as well as for a texture map.
Basic body are simple geometrical forms that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.
One texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a colour card.
& Schickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browsers. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.
Images can be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.
The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking on the & LMBs; or the Return Return can show.
You can set if any image will be displayed in your own window, or if all images are supposed to use the same window.
If you are looking for a specific file, you simply type the first sign of filename in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the right corner. if a suitable filename is found, the file will be highlighted by pressing return or & Esc.
In the engagement - & snap show; there are five card cards. in three of them, general and processing and slideshow, you can set the workwise of & snap show; set in the two other, short order for the display window and brief command to the browser, the keys can be specified for the respective window.
If this is selected, images are open in full screen mode. if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with background color that you can set down below. preset is not full-screen mode.
If this point is activated, downloads & snap show; already the next picture in the folder, while you still choose the current picture. this reduces the delay, if you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.
With this option stores & snap show; with the end of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & snap show; this folder in the browser window.
Click on the coloured beam to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of screen in fullscreen mode. when in window mode the window is bigger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.
You can use & snap show; set up, that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.
This option will display the display window display on the full screen for large pictures. this option is enabled.
Specify whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.
The time span between the image change at a slide show. in order to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.
The number of repeats. if this value is set to 0, the slide show will be repeated until it is broken down. in order to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field. the default is 1.
Here, change the keynote for the different modes of business cards; in the box charts short order for the display window and brief command to the browser.
With this option you can switch between the two-piece view of the file system (a window for the subfolder and a window for files) and the one-piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window.
Displays great symbols for files in the folder. this ad is only possible in the short description.
Displays small symbols for files in the folder. this ad is only possible in the short description.
Displays preview for files in the folder. this ad is only possible in the short description.
Shrinks the picture by 10%. the factor refers to the current size of the image.
Increased the picture by 10%. the factor is based on the current size of the image.
Closes the display window for pictures. & snap show; is also closed when there is no browser window anymore.
View the image in original size. this is only useful when automatic scaling is enabled.
Opens the input field for completion. specify the first sign of the filename you are looking for. if the file is found, it will be selected.
& showphoto; is a & KDE; photo editing based on & digitization; image editing. & showphoto; is part of the digitization; project.
& showphoto; is a quick picture modification with some powerful basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes.
Like the rest of & KDE; is & showphoto; an open source project. this means that the user contributes up his part, at least problems and potential improvements.
& showphoto; makes it possible to notify you as easy as possible error or possible improvements. if you use this, your browser doesn't open a page to reports about problems and wishes. all required information is already filled, and you can simply follow the instructions to transfer your message.
& showphoto; is a project that is supported by a community. that means that users and developers may help each other. if you are a more common user of & showphoto, we will be able to answer any questions about other users. in this mailinglist, English language is spoken, you should be powerful in this language.
The best start to participate in & showphoto; it is the developer mailing list. guidance to join the developer mailing list of & showphoto;.
& showphoto; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many options that can access the behavior of & showphoto. in order to set up on this settings, you'll need to set up in eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left.
In the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed if the sub- or overexposure indicator should be selected, the colors with what you are supposed to indicate in contrast. exposure should display a bright color and overexposed a dark colour.
The main window of & showphoto shows a side bar on the right edge, which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images. you can also view this page, in which you click on one of the five riders:
& skanlite; is an application to scan images that do not generate more than pictures and enrich them.
& skanlite; is a simple application to scan and wipe them. & skanlite; can save a dialog to store and save the pictures immediately in a specified file with automatically generated names and format. the user can also display images from the image.
You can check the status of your scanner on the sane-project page by typing the necessary information on this search page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.
A standard scanner can be set up on the command line of & skanlite; if this scanner can't be opened or if no standard scanner is specified, then a dialog will open to choose the scanner.
The user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner. cancel & scanlite; end.
The further settings contain more detailed options of the driver. & skanlite; (libksane) do not treat these options especially.
To order a picture, the user can only launch a forefront and then choose scanning for the final scan. the preference can be started through the preview button.
To make the image better, the user can zoom in and out of the current selection out zoom. it can set the zoom as well, that the complete preview can fit into the window.
If the image was chosen, the final image can be read with the scan button.
If there is a preview of Save a Preview into the settings, then the image will appear in a preview window, as shown below is displayed. when saving is pressed, then the image is saved and lie? en lead to a breakdown and return to the main window.
By the button settings, the eponymous dialogue is open before the main window. you can change the key settings here.
The user can view the image if desired, before saving. in this case, the option must be selected before storing a preview site. if this preview of users are not desired, the option must be selected.
This adjustment allows them to select the way to save. dialog to save each image opens the dialog before any single-called image. if & skanlite, this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder, then you must save saving without after a filename.
This setting defines where the pictures are stored at the option without using a filename. if the pictures are stored after each scan, then this folder is used as default for dialogue to save. the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button... change.
This parameter defines a picture prefix for automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog to save. the automatically stored image will receive a numerical suffix of each time, when a picture is stored. the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers.
The user can adapt the image quality to save image quality. this value also changes the compression value when saving. if Select the image quality is not selected, the default value of Qt is used.
The button help starts the KDE help with the & skanlite; -manual. the button above starts the KDE Over-Dialog box for & skanlite;. the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish & skanlite; to end.
& skanlite; is licensed under the GPL and the libksane library, which is used by & skanlite, under LGPL. attention: libsane is licensed under the GPL with an exception.
& ambassadors, used like all other programs selected buttons. below you can set up a list of these shortcut and their function. you can set up with the right mouse button in the player window, click here. select the & amroad; specific keypaste you can click with the right mouse button in the player window and choose short command... Select.
You may also set up existing Multimedia buttons so that it will work as & amarok; -Short commands. this allows you to make your keyboard to the & amarok; control centre.
The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which are in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and shall describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts.
Amarok supports command-line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.
You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed due to a lack of dependence. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use dialog, so the user does not run why a script is not running.
Instructions for 'Korundum' cue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE binding for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is Required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '
In scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or expand it simply to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing by scripts is relatively easy.
With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange about Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be enclosed every KDE installation.
Most scripting languages allow to execute external programs and commands. mostly the function exec () is used. in this way, dcop > can be quite simply called. here an example in Python:
& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts are attributed to the default setting of the script. for this reason, scripts must be running their default entry to monitor and respond accordingly to events. of course a script can ignore the events as it does not use.
Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save the store and loading of the setup data, each script will need to take care. if a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder, where all data should be saved.
TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script may now ask & zb; with DCOP-functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).
VolumeChange newvolume controls a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.
Customize menu: submenu and itemtitle will also be handed over to the selected files on the playlist. to add a custom menu entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop ambigscript addMenuItem (submenu itemtitle) to remove dcop ambigscript removeCustomMenuItem (submenu entry).
Before & ambassadors have stopped, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to work for example the saving of data or configuration settings.
Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.
& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.
The main criticism must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameters -p to obtain the file rights:
When your script package is finished, you can go up to www.kde-apps.org and hang the link to the Viking Script's page of & amarok; hang on for your entry to KDE-apps you should use the category ambassadors.
& amarok; is an audio player for & KDE;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprising easy to use.
With & amarok; you can simply drag music to playlist, instead of endless menus. maybe you are looking for a quite certain title of thousands in your collection. maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's Collectors Browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds.
Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if your decision is still difficult, choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically the right music after certain criteria.
Amarok has an excellent support for Apple iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. these and many other useful functions make Amarok for the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and shy - just the right thing to refresh your music!
Usually you have to enter in the base folder of Amarok sources, to compile Amarok and install:
Since & amarok; autoconf and automake utilized, you should have compile problems. if you encounter problems, please report these in the & KDE; mailing lists.
& amarok; has some options to activate or disable the use of the configure script with the configure script. this is a list of available options.
For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies must be met, so that they can be used. details are required in the System requirements.
Activating Debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & ambassadors, you should use full use.
& ambassadors; can be set up without any effort via setting dialog. the setup dialog has several cardboard cards to set up the various functions of & amarok;.
Player window displays the player window in addition to playlist, respectively. if the option is switched off, only the playlists window display is displayed.
Tuning barometer use: this feature is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. the option toggle the experimental function of the voting barometer.
Design fuller: this feature is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. thus, the used color scheme for tuning barometer is changed.
Voice files at the music files: this function is only available if & amusing is compiled. if this setting is enabled, .mood files are stored at the location of corresponding music files. otherwise the .mood files are stored in the settings directory of & amarok; stored (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / ambush / moodbar / etc.).
External Browser: lets you choose what browser of & amarok; can be started when a browser is needed.
Other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list.
Playlist when storing, save the current playlist automatically at the end of & amarok;. turn this option when you don't want to lose the current playlist in the event.
Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you activate this setting, & ambush; relative paths to the music files, starting from the memory location of the playlist. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files are stored.
Current piece of work visibly hold that the playlists window opens / off, to keep track of the running pieces always in the visible window area.
When unit changes to context-browser changes automatically shows the context-browser once the next piece is played.
In the section image you can adjust & amarok; adjust the appearance. section is in three parts lower part.
In the font section, you can set the use of various writings in & ambush. you can select writings for the following range: playlists windows, Player windows and context-browser. press on ID, so you can choose a select font from the selection dialog.
With the selection of user-defined color scheme, you can define the Qual of choice and can create an own color scheme. using them the selected color chosen for front and background colour.
Play at the start, that & amarok; after the program start, playback automatically with the piece where it was stopped at the last time.
The window on On-screen display allows you to set up on the OSD. if on-screen display is checked, a preview of OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.
The first option is the font. click on selecting... to select from the dialog box font for the OSD. the checkbox shade causes the text in the OSD shaded.
Your own colors will give you the opportunity to adapt the OSD colors for writing and background. if you don't use color surfaces, the default colors will not be activated, the pre-set & KDE models are used.
The input field display is displayed in OSD. by input, the OSD card can be adapted to your needs. below, you can find a list of the available placeholder and what they mean.
The option screen is intended for Xinama-users. thus, you can choose to appear on which screen a multi-screen monitor environment will appear on the OSD.
The audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the radio box. some drivers are able to activate more options in this card card.
The card collection is used for setting all settings for your collection. this includes the file and the type of database for the collection.
Here you can select the folder, the & ambush. to browse a folder to the collection. in order to include a folder in the collection with its name. this section also includes cross fields for inserting, as with the selected folders.
Browse subfolder: this causes & ambassadors to search for music as well as their subfolder in search of music.
Modifications: allows & ambush; to monitor the selected file on changes (e.g. music files are added or deleted). furthermore, an incremental search is carried out to take the necessary changes on your collection.
Playlists importing that & ambush; all found playlists in your collection files (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. automatically added playlists later in the playlists browser.
The part Collectors database is used to choose a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySQL. if MySQL is selected, additional installation is necessary in the window of MySQL setup.
The MySQL setup is used to set up the database for & amarok; uses the calculator, where the MySQL database is located. afterwards, under Port: the network port is entered, under which the database is achievable. name: is the database name that the connection is made.
Use username: and password: for setting the data required for the connection to the database.
The load card last.fm sets the support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations concerning the current piece.
Here you specify your user name and password for your last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one at the last.fm website.
Send the pieces and update the profile: this setting enables it & amroad; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.
Similar Interpreting: after activation this setting is called & amarok; a list with similar interpreters at each of the played pieces. note: you can't need the list in the context-browser. note: you need no overload profile to use this feature.
& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). more information can be found in summary of the functions and gallery with screen photographs.
AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to find Kdelibs so installed (including the programs contained, because & amarok; requires some of them to find modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial how to compile Kdelibs minimal.
Some functions such as the OSD assumes that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example, but Fluxbox will help to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these represent an excellent development environment.
Probably one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library. you can notice this error to the TagLib developer under buud.kde.org and append the caputte file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and recreate the collection again.
Mostly that is why Taglib is in charge of reading the meta-info from this file system. please report this error to the TagLib developer under buud.kde.org.
If you're using MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for in & amarok; is a bit mature.
Make sure that all of & ambassadors have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, e.g. & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib has been compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to crash when editing the meta-information.
If you use KDE with artsd, then deactivate your machine. turn off if inactive for... in the setting of sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.
You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a common crash, and send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.
This is because many program data write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but this does not fix as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.
#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- > new ($argv > get _ v2tag; print _ v2tag [$v2tag, amp; UTF8);
This script requires the Perl module MP3:: mplib. it can be installed with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: mplib'
& amarok; S symbols are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bugs in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes, you can simply forget the status display in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes you can click the status deactivated to grey and semi-transparent. please note that in some cases, you have to click on a icon until this setting shows its effect.
If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9offset PixmapERK7Qpixels, then check if amaroK uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarocapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.
To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliant Qt version or delete / etc / ld.so.conf so that amaroK takes the right version first.
There are some possibilities. most installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert your unix or Linux distribution. you can also use help with other users or developers. use the Forum and IRC below irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.
Bugzilla is not suitable to seek help. please fill in there only one error if something is located in the correction of a defect in amaroK itself.
After the start of & ambassadors, only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come into music there?
This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.
To keep the surface intuitively, the start window in the statistic window was converted. you will find it under Extras's statistics.
The meaning of these symbols has been changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are available for evaluation by users while the points are automatically calculated.
To evaluate pieces, this playlist must be shown in the playlist of the playlist and select columns. click on the new application column to determine the evaluation for a piece. you can also use the short command Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.
Select the files you want to remove and press down on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from playlist from the wake-up menu.
Drag a playlists file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there, just as you would do it with other files. that's easy: -)
In the toolbar of the playlist, next to the Add-button, the button is playlist. click on it.
Probably you're missing the program XMMS-devel and install the XMMS-devel package and install & amarok; new. look even to libvisual, this package contains many very beautiful visualizations.
The Equalizer is located in the context menu (reachable via right mouse button). in addition, you can find it via the menu bar among extras Equalizer.
No. yes, that's true! no! & amarok; uses one from the backend independent approach, therefore the real question must be Gstreamer / xine / Arts / Nmm / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support so pretty any thoughtful audio format. GStreamer can even code text and PNG files!
It may! perhaps you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which the default does not include MP3 decoder. the solution: old-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 KDE, EINGABETASTE
Start the YaST online update and install the 'Multimedia option' Pack 1 '. so... & amarok; plays MP3's from: -)
If you use the Alsa-Sink, the device has to prepare a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously simultaneously audio (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software-mixer).
The issue of this command should help you in search of the problem and help a solution. for GStreamer, you may have to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).
That does & amarok; already. don't forget that media must be decoded first. you can just send an MP3 sound to ALSA. GStreamer is reading the best choice if you need a decor with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoding it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.
Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly on ALSA, just like xine.
Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open sound server with highest priority (real-time prioriety) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper suid is set:
With KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDEMultimedia Codecs that may cause to create playback. read this error report. read the sound-buffer in your ALSA-setup file .asoundrc can also help.
Either you don't use the Arts drivers, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to receive the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).
Presumably you use the Arts driver. use a different driver (the xine drivers has been greatly optimized for analyzer), or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the fewer requests react to the visualizations. yes, this is an error, please help us to fix it.
GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & ambush. why?
After installation of GStreamer you have to register all components. perform GST-Registry to register all GStreamer components.
Read the GStreamer FAQ. if this does not help you can also ask the IRC channel # gstreamer.
Try this (quit amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run GST-register once your normal user. then delete the module folder with GST-config / gasiamer-config) and execute GST register again. now start & ambush.
Please report it under buud.kde.org. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes, send them to our mailing list: ambition-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.
& amarok; is an album of the British Mike Oldfield. I like it very and find that the name sounds good. furthermore, the name contains the magical K...:)
Thanks to DCOP, this is already possible. set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm command this command: dcop amusplayer play
This command makes & amarok; start playing. make sure that & ambush. run before you go to bed, then you will be woken by the gentle sounds of the music you have stopped in front of bed.
How to learn the current page in & amarok; ongoing titles if you are on another computer?
If a functioning SSH environment is available, you can proceed as follows: this command gives you performers and titles of the current piece: ssh -i ~ / .ssh / id _ RSA ihreIP dcop --user-reusable username player nowplaying
Replace IP address with your IP and your username with your user name. this assumes that your identification in the file / .ssh / id _ RSA is present.
The visualizations can be separated from & amarok; window separately. press on the keyboard and the current analyst opens in an independent, in size variable window.
The combination of Ctrl + Rights Maustaste makes a piece in the clicks sequence into the queue. by pressing the ONE ETETASTE searching for a search in playlist, the first search result is played and the search is reset.
OK, the player window and the playlist have trickly functions, but how does it look like with the symbol in the system section of the control bar?
Click the & RMBn; click on the title of a browser. in the context menu, you can select which browser are to be displayed.
My personal file $HOME is on an NFS drive. after the start of amaroK the collection database can not be created and on the console there are many errors. what now?

Place the CD, then click on the audio CD. it's a file browser with multiple folders. select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination in a conqueror window. instead, select files from the folders mp3 or ogg instead.
QCingList, values = query ("SELECT playcounter, createdate, percentage-ROM," "WHERE url = '% 1';) .arg (turn of the string);
Basically, this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value, based on how often the piece was played. the more often the piece was played, the less influence has each individual evaluation on the overall result.
You can also register the rating for a piece by clicking on a column in the playlists in the playlist box. then check the review of a piece in the playlists using the right mouse button on the piece and edit: rating, select or F2. you can also edit the rating also in the metadata dialog.
The developers don't want to inform you when you want to publish a stable version of amaroK. this means: KDE packages have a fixed release plan that is not related to the short-term plan of amaroK.
This is a new function in amaroK which some users can also find quite annoying. deactivate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings.
The Analyzer is part of the tool bar. select Settings toolbars... and take the desired changes there.
Download a design down or create an own. install this then under amaroK... image text context-browser design, click on New Design...

If you want to use ALSA, please check the latest version. old ALSA versions have a lot of downfall and caused a lot of error reports.
Presumably & amarok; compiled before you have xine or gamer have installed. therefore, the output module does not compile this output modules. you need to configure & rev; re-configure and install.
Now I have & amarok; re-installed, but the output modules still do not appear. and now?
Presumably, use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program. although GStreamer is installed, the necessary developers need to install. the same applies to xine, you need to install xine-devel. afterwards, you need to recompile and install again.
I get the error GStreamer-Critical * *: factory for 'Adder'has no type.. How can I fix it?
Your version of GStreamer has been compiled with Prelinking, this is incompatible with GStreamer. you need to compile GStreamer without Prelinking. a tip of Merlin-TC: using no LDFLAGS if you compile amaroK.
I get the error message There is no element present to act the file's mimetype audia / mp4, although the gamer-faad is installed.
To play mp4 or m4a files with GStreamer, the gamer-quicktime module also has to be installed in addition to gamer-faad.
You will receive the mistake There is no element present to act the stream's mimetype audio / mpeg.
You play a MP3 Stream, but the module's gamer mad is not installed. install the module and then run as system administrator GST register. then start amaroK.
I have a second sound card and use ALSA. how can amaroK use the second sound card?
Under attitudes amaroK set up... audio output, enter the device. typical is B. HW: 0 for the standard sound card and HW: 1 for the second.
Here you can see an example for ~ / .asoundrc on a machine with an onboard AC97 codec and a USB audio device:
Divindication 8x0 {type HW card 0} pcm.usb-audio {type PW card 0} pcm.usb-audio {type plug slave.pcm "HW: 1" ctl.usb-audio {type HW card 1}
Enter the setup dialog of xine now usb-audio, and the output is performed on the USB sound card. so-lib takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate, channels and so on).
If you want to use a virtual dmix device, disable the check boxes at sound card supports mmap.
Sorry, but the audio-edition of Arts will not continue to take care of. you may, of course, gladly take care of this problem! if you want, you can get the new so urgently needed coach for Arts:)

Burns a previously created CD image. the dialog will ask you to a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as data source, which can immediately be burned immediately by pushing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)
Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you to a * .iso file as data source, which can then be burned immediately by pushing the burning button.
A DVD video can be converted to this dialogue window. this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the ingredients, but can also be used everywhere. it contains information about the selected video, body settings and even possibilities for changing the size and to cut black edges.
Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is represented in the ingredients and include characteristics of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.
Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b;. if an entry is crossed, the tool bar is currently visible in the main window.
When this is crossed, a small body is displayed at the bottom edge of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is burned.
Switches the folder view one or out. the folder view includes an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their content will be displayed in the contents view. CD / DVD drives have also displayed a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlocking of the drive or discard of the medium.
Switches the contents view on or off. the contents view enables choosing and pulling files into the project view. the ingredients is also selected to read audio or video CDs, if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.
Turns the headbar in the projectors' view or off. the headstrip is a narrower area, which is only visible when the projectiles has no real function, it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.
This opens a dialogue window to changing the keys instructions for & k3b; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment.
This will start the k3b; set-up assistants. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator privileges will need to enter the password for the system administrator (root).
Opens the settings of & k3b;. here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialogue is intended for personalize and for the purpose of the program.
& k3b; is, like many others & KDE; applications also, with one & DCOP; -interface equipped with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script.
To use the & DCOP; -functions, you can either use the command line dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionallity, so it is more your taste and the type of your task is crucial to give you the mutual programs.
In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; -functions, you need to make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following on the console:
Besides general & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; -program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two additional parts described below.
The Standard DCOP-Interface of & k3b; sets functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other functions to create new projects.
DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject (). copyCd (). copyDvd ()-formatdvd (). burnCdImage (KURL url). burnDvdImage (KURL url)
As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd, and then a reference to the project can be obtained via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference is possible to change the project about K3bProjectinterface.
K3b features the features of K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):
The createFolder (Qstring name) of the createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring. )-addresh (URL): List URLs, QString Specifications (QString path, Qstring original name) and setbacks ID (Qstring path)
This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple files and then add files to the new folder:
#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / foo dcop / somefile.txt / foo / bar
& audio creator; is an audio CD; -read for & KDE; with it can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the machine installed on the machine.
& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and from many codiers to encode these wav files (compressed-free compression). more coders can be added to the program (if installed).
First the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the machine (lossless and compressed); and then
In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as the lossfree FLAC.
For the first step, read out the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.
For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, so it is very likely not to compile anything itself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.
Which code / file format should be used? chapter Which Kodiver provides a small introduction about coders, audio quality and compressing factors.
A word to copy of protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the protection, it is not possible to read any copy protection; not to read the mechanisms of the copy protection; simply avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copying-protected audio CD; s!
While setting it only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily way to read a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the slender base of the user interface, which you frequently stumbles at the beginning.
Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)
Can & CD; get information from the internet or can work fully without a network, where everything is covered manually.
This is only a short list of commands of the master's instructions. on the page step for example, more information, as this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the registers for the program.
If the CDDB will start the CDDB file on request in the CDDB tab. (this may be locally or online), in the latter case first must be connected to the Internet.)
Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the tab device preferences tab - the encoding.
Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default. it is noted that the encoder's encoder register was configured in the setup dialog.
Opens the file manager, allowing a selected file to encode, instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.
Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (like protocols, piepsen) for programming events (such as read the CD; terminates).
Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (such as encoder, to set the encoders). here you must go before the program can be used successfully!
This chapter describes sound quality, body and compression rates, and helps you choose the right codiers.
If no audio information is to be lost is a loss-free audio format needed. besides FLAC, there are also other similar to 'shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.
Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes today have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important because both coders are very good audio quality.
O'not so 'free, lame is still available with most distributions, but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates) but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a machine or machine-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present.
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as Standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - initially in 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.
A short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):
'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already very high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.
'--press' extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.
'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.
'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate of approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by adolescents, portable devices and auto-stereotypes, but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.
'--preset Insulane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want the absolutely high quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.
The & CD; information that can be entered manually or through the program automatically from the FreeDb program, available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program for the folder and file names as well as the features of music files.
In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierers explain the switch for these programs.
For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.
This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):
This is what the FreeDb is: a free database, in which people can read / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself in the calculator. it is too aware that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.
Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberle) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added to the music company. any information can be stored in a bumblebee by a & CD; store, physical or virtual.
In & kaudiocreator; is active to choose a checkbox (sending an address). for the use of FreeDb it can be used with another (fake) address. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used by the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)
There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator, used for use of FreeDb, is to be used to use geographically at the next purpose mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.
A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of Spiegelservern for the online invoke of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually a month) only the updates of the database.
Which program program is used to store pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my calculator?
There are rumors that cdparanoia will use, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see to note that the cdparanoia packet has to be installed first if this is not yet done.
To store the selected WAV files, the codiers and the desired file format can be selected. on the first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression of audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added to this tab.
The code package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codiers. more information about Kodiers are in the Chapter World Deeper.
After installation of a Kodierers you can receive further information on its switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). you must replace 'lame' by the name of the installed code.
This may have many causes. verify the device model name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and read on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio coders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to explain both programs with a command line in a terminal.
Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the CD; this will not succeed.
There is a chapter with a step for Step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.
Do you have read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.
In this example, we will launch the program for the first time; reading everything and our first & CD; reading 'lame' --preset extreme 'to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).
It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can always do.
Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have a write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into the context).
The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something probably is done only once and
The second section describes the action to read a & CD; what must be repeated for any output & CD;
Here we determine the reusable code for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = > VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with you to download the FreeDb program to download the CD; data from the Internet.
Although we can change these settings at any time, we will be very likely not to read on any page of a CD; change when once the appropriate settings are found.
The device model is given to the program program to read the & CD; -dates / pieces can read.
Frequently it is / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device type of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a CD; / DVD drive is also available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use existing entries for the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.
The card card General Settings. here you can't do much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be changed / entered as shown on the screenshot.
Only If incomplete information can be consulted, so that you will be informed if data are missing from keyword (tags).
The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and release the CD; data automatically via the Internet from a FreeDb calculator.
Note: the calculator must be connected during the read & CD; connected to the internet to access the FreeDb server.
The second select field is easier, becomes a & CD player, starts instantly the reading of the CD player, and it will be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag records, they can easily changed with the database name - > renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.
Aside from this example, you can continue to note: if you are able to set off the box and FreeDb is not used. however, you can use FreeDb locally in the offline mode, so check out the two select boxes, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.
CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving & CD; information from the FreeDb server to the internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about FreeDb. set it all as it is shown in the screenshot.
Mode: we did not download the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.
CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this route the load is distributed between the machines. however, this attitude will work as the first attempt.
Both work equivalent to the server, as there are many firewalls the protocol 8880 standardly, there is perhaps more fortunate to surf with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf on the Internet.
In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be enough.
Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists)
Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel read and encode? the author don't know, therefore simply try.
CD; after reading the last piece: cross it around the & CD; cast out at the end of the process.
User-defined folder for temporary files: if you are specified, the path must be stored in which the wav-files are stored. this is not useful if only space on another drive is available. do not forget this folder, if you want to do something with the WAV files.
All so set as it is on the screenshot. the command is something long, under circumstances, something must be puffed to the right to see everything.
'--press' extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo audio systems. the resulting rate factor is approximately 224-256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.
Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary change of tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).
Put the rest like in screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:
The number of encoded WAV files: at a dualcore or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.
That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as default for each interpreter & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.
In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, which is organized in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the CD; data from the FreeDb is to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any output & CD;
Since we use a & CD which is not included in FreeDb, the screen photographs are a little different than those responsible for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving data from the internet. comments are shown on the differences.
Try not the & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' edition of the author this manual.
If this is not done yet, now the & CD, into the drive that was defined in the main window, has to be moved.
After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and read by cdparanoia.
If this is not happening, then search in section questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.
Attention: if the & CD has been removed successfully by the FreeDb, all tracks are already filled and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed.
For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key is displayed, and you can select the database entry, in your opinion best to your & CD; fits.
If you don't select the checkbox for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually retrieve them through choice of the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have any local database, we need the connection to the Internet.
E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - enter the CD-data and title of the first piece
Specify the data for your & CD; in accordance with the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.
The artist does not have to be entered in an input field 'Update Title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.
The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidiciell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD.
Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the FreeDb, the CD editor is not empty. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words are starting with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.
Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the field on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 signs for the comment field. if you are set to ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least for what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the tab tab.
You can change the tag information from the generated files anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.
Tags are not supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see the help of the Kodierer in order to obtain more information.
Simply select an entry which is obvious to the style of the output CD; it is not important because we don't transmit the & CD; -data anyway isn't exaggerating. for more information please visit the categories of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under Rock.
After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.
The window of the CD editor appears again and you'll see that the fields are already filled with the checked data, which we have already recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply type the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.
Click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;
Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.
It is the third knob of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the checklist.
Note that there is a check-in before every line of a piece. only the titles can be selected as selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece. select the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces on once.
It has been launched by clicking on the button selection process, so this window appears to confirmation. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track down what is going on.
Click on the riders orders to switch to the order window. it's in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.
This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.
You can see this error message if you are trying to work with a coater that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.
By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in an example. have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target file?; -)
Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.
The order 1 reads the first piece which is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and encode parallel. note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.
The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and encode. with powerful machines, the calculator with an amd64 seems no problem with simultaneous interpreting and encode (of, however, two different pieces).
Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window.
For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & KDE; 3.x / 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.
& kaudiocreator; used today inside the & KDE; CVS is a part of the crushing media packages. however, if you are using CVS, you can download a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & KDE; package. if you read this, you've probably already done it...
This section is directed to persons compiled by source files, and not intended for users to use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.
If you are looking for assistance, how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running, then the following is correct for you:
A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. best read the step for step example to know the options and settings. it displays screen photos of the various flashcards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.
Hello, still alive? even if only the help menu has been clicked out after the first start of the program it should go out of this somehow empty screen (especially if the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?
What is it about? who reads it, probably started the program. it should look somehow like this:
A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author can't store this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual for & kaudiocreator; it is intended. at least after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this proposal.
Strange if you managed to get the source file from the & KDE; SVN, then you don't need this information, but...
& kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others, it has not have some properties of real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting texts either, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.
& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on all systems with OSS and & KDE; support function & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is required for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequenzer.
& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.
Graphical representation of any MIDI channel's activity through highlighting of pressing buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.
Drag & drop so that you can drag & KDE; any MIDI file from a & Konqueror; window on KMid.
Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (lyrics or textures). KMid is automatically calculated using the procedures used.
Seat support. if you finish & KDE; end the recording of a song, KMid will start again with the same song again.
Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).
First, you can choose from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.
You can also make a file from a & Konqueror; window in the & kmid; window to drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.
To play a piece of music, open it and play the button Playing in the tool bar, select the entry playback from the menu piece or make the space bar.
Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you go to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played each other.)
Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button, and drive through the knobs.
If you find that a song is too fast or too slowly, you can click on the left and right of the Tempoad and then change the speed speed. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.
The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry pause in the menu, thus interrupts the playback. mix the space bar while no pieces is played, starts & kmid; playback.
Song texts can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics, and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)
In & kmid; you can set up which events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is checked automatically, enabling you to adjust the entry automatic text selection automatically, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type.
If you want to set a event type, choose from the menu settings the entries text events or push events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.
A collection is a list of MIDI files which summarize you. these are part of the series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.
To create a collection, open the collection manager first. find out in the menu collection under the point. click here to New and give the name for the collection.
You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then add the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.
If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the healthier in the collection manager.
Into the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.
When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add many pieces.
To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add to the button add a song. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.
A second method to add a song, depends on the setting automation add to the collection.
When automatic add to the collection, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).
If automatical add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and gelded. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.
To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song, then click on it.
You can select the sequence in which the songs are played. if you select a row from the sub-menu track sequence of the menu, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.
If you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.
To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.
To jump a song, select the button next song, next song from the menu, press the right arrow right.
To reverse the way back a song, select the button above, the previous piece from the menu or press the button arrow to the left.
To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, click on the button clearing.
The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmide; not stored.
This is necessarily necessary for synthesizer which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI-events occur in events that understands the synthesizer.
For example, you can create a MIDI-Map which converts all events of the Change patch to Bright piano in the events of Change Change patch to Trumpet, thus making a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.
If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).
Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).
A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the necessary rules for playing a piece.
Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. premise for this is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).
Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "Another keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END
You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.
Please send me your map file as an email, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.
In this section the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:
Please note that the left-left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.
The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the sounds, which need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not able to take a gun (e.g. with tone 60), you can gain a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a rifle. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:
So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (winning), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file.
Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, with which each note is another percussioning tool (drum, basin, maracas & etc;) and not the one that the sound height of the same drum means (as some keyboards have).
The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how to use sounds on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:
Like the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.
You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. they only have to use different names in the first line.
Keyboards are used primarily to make sounds to the percolt channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.
This section can be used to set some channels on others. if you want to swap a few channels to others. if you want to swap out the first and second channel, you simply do it in CHANNELMAP section.
However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).
MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:
N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyboard map will need to be defined in the file. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use Patch x.
The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percolt patch on the percolt channel.
The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which relation Pitch-Bender event will be multiplied and then forwarded with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then the value is 4096 being used in the map file (no decimal places).
This setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that will play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to a octave above. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmide.
To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu settings, point MIDI settings
The canalview is a window with a full range of piano pieces (one for every MIDI channel). you can see which sounds are just played.
You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the knob lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.
The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played tones. view from the menu settings below the point sealview: settings
The pace-LCD displays the speed when a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.
You can change the pace of a song. so if you find it, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.
A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices too much different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way.
Good, I cannot compel anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file is needed (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also modify the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over everything.
That can happen if you have compiled a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to remove the problem, you need to download and install the source
I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.
In understand, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.
In advance, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, files are added to the temporary collection.
You can set the arrow key left from Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the default tempo you can click on the LCD.
I have on a & KDE; -Desktop a & Konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only change in the & Konqueror; window to change and go to the desired file in the window of & kmid;
If you want to listen to one file only once, without adding it right to a collection, turn the setting automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.
Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you want to play the first file. so, set the setup automatically to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.
Then decide to play as B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?
These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animates me to continue using & kmid; to program.
& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am writing a bit of free time for my Hobbies, but I'm trying to collect myself a bit of time. as Hobbies I'll collect program, MIDI files, making music and prove sentences.
If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es
You can really make me a giant freaking, if you send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I'll send you into contact with friends of & kmid; but if you want a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may have the file already.
I have written & kmide; completely written in my spare time and made no harm to anyone. I would therefore stress that I just receive feedback from users (post cards or e-mails).
Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - correction of the error that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.
My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Mr. Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive e-mail.
And of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the network that give us these wonderful Midi- and karaoke files.
In addition to this can be found & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlar.es / ~ rlar.es / ~ rlar.es / ~ rlar.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and viewing images. you also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;
A sound card. I highly recommend you a sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE card.
If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it is run as if you would have a sound card, except that you can't hear music.
If problems occur, contact one of the KDE; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.
& kmplayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon formats as well as for playback of DVD, VCD or TV and camera.
The documentation for & kappname; was not yet ended as & KDE; installed on this computer.
For additional help, please check the page The KDE website on new releases, or the question to The & KDE; user Mailing list.
The application window is made of called andockable windows. there's always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear if information is shown in it.
It is possible to enrich the preferred connections under the menu Bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, use the category of permanent playlist.
Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchies. if you have a record, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and the playback will start with the requested entry.
The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist may also be changed by direct Editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do if & kmplayer, can be viewed by a text file, but also on a name of a category. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this component will be displayed.
After changing XML files, it must be selected from the menu, or select the playlist, or select either the edit mode, or select another category.
All changes are lost when editing mode or any other group will be selected without the playlist.
Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.
The animation when starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 obsc. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.
It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / cascplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format needs to be an supported XML file.
The animation during starters doesn't need to be short, it will be automatically completed by opening any other source. however, this would end with the end-animation however, the user can end the application a second time.
A simple example of a start-animation can be the advertisements of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; IMG dur = "intr.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; / bodyboard; In the source package of & kmplayer; in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL are supported by & kmplayer.
There is a rider for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here, the path can be set by the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.
Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.
There is no rider for this restart device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything has to be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here's an example of a 'flash' using the swfdec-mozilla module:
'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be used to embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.
To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave-flash can be specified in the alignment dialog file association of KDE.
The conqueror or & kmplayer; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module. if there are no mistakes, the backend volume is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).
This is always a pre-given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if it has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:
& kmplayer; can be downloaded from TV cards, either via MPlayer or Xvideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.
For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in kmplayer is the dialog in the settings below - > Quelle- > VDR- > XVideo Port. there you should be detected, of which one is selected. the correct coding must be found (e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.
Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo, it should also work on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension has to be supported for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).
Internally you are used by KMPlayer for the sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation this dvdnavel, source, source, vcdsource, source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start with the playlist of playlist.
Are there indications how I can quieter my CDROM drive, if I play from it (not of the VCD: / /)?
Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root as user, and it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.
Xine starts only slowly, why must my CPU be tested on their performance?
Note: the answer is overtaking. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine is checked to test the CPU.

Gopher has originally begun as a unified campus-Informations system of the University of Minnesota. Gopher allows the user to access information on Gopher-servers on the Internet.
Gopher allows the user to add the position of the desired information in a bookmark (Bookmark) to the information without the entire menu. Gopher menus are not standardized, so far as that any Gopher Server is subject to certain information.

QT;: & Qt; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support and is needed for compile & ile; required.
Latex;: a professional greeting application. under Unix-like systems probably will be accessed using the package & texlive; respectively & tetex; (for older systems).
Most of these components can be used in the & Linux; distribution format. for installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD can be used.
The & kile; -Project contains some already compiled packages of & kile; for various distributions. these allow easy installation without further compile and are included on the ile; -website.
This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with & latex;, & KDE;, & kile; or & Linux;.
Advanced users must hardly read these manual. however, there are all proposals concerning the documentation. if the support is required for this project or the documentation, the contact information should be made about the kile; -website.
These questions arise or when compile from & kile; on or if extensions are desired, this should be addressed to the mailing list kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.
& kile; is an integrated & latex; -environment for the use of all & latex; -functions in a graphical interface and within this one easy, immediate and customised access to all & latex; functions. furthermore, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management.
To find out more about & Kate; and his possibilities should be attracted to Kate's Guide. users from & kile; can start with the editor's work with the editor of & Kate.
For & latex; is the correct pronunciation: Lay-TECH; it is difficult to use, a Laie (engl. Lay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less sophisticated but realistic version is that from the surname of Leslie La mport.
In case there is only a good view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to do. to control & latex; right-proof should be necessary, such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.
The same as other drawing languages includes & latex; an introduction to which the generalized properties like paper format, aspect ratio and text grasping will be specified as well as a box starting with the command\\ '{document} and must be closed again with the command\\' {document}.
The rapid-entry assistant of & kile; is a new feature for the rapid creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the assistants (MenÃ ¼ r) offers some options for creating the document. also, some of them can be done on the document-related settings.
Document categories: this is the type of documenting the document. article (article), book [book], report [report], article (DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrreprt], a book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [leggi], foils [prosper] or custom.
Code: this should be used with encoding. it should use the encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding than standard. best, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of the latex; -documents).
This list contains the mostly used packages for & latex; for the integration they are only irradiated in the crossroads.
Articles (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (subject to compliance with German DIN rules). you should always use German texts.
New users are not worried anymore. there is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this section are given in the section.
& kile; offers - just like other sources of source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile; you should have a simple problem search on the screen. however, it is nevertheless noticed by the modest appearance of output file. however, it will save you through the highlighting time and rust.
With automatic completion of the environments, if you enter a new command (e.g.\\ '{command}) of & kile; automatically create an empty line (to enter the text) and the added line to enter the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can set up in the menu settings; set up... LaTeX commands are deactivated.
All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; encouraged the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most important and the substrate element):
In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective level.
When creating the own & latex; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file has been created, jumps & kile; through one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; amount to the corresponding line in the latex; source code.
A DVI; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and devices.
When using the rinsk search, the elements of the DVI; file is clicked with the editor, and once upon an element in the latex; source code is speculated. once upon a section in the latex; source code is clicked, the corresponding position is speckled in DVI; -viewer.
Master-Document: this function is used on work with multiple files. using a Master document, work with other integrated .tex files are simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be adjusted for project settings.
Fast construction: the latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (unless there are no mistakes in the source code).
File recovery: in this mode, the DVI; file is set to open-wavy, and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.
For viewing the processing tool bar, the three large-scale selection fields should be used. the first selection field is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The deliverable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:
The selection field Additional features for items such as keywords, joints, notes or references. the options are available:
Name: this command will create a name for a section, a picture or a different element.
Reference: will be used for reference to a specified name (choose a selection box).
When using quote, a selection list with literary entries will be displayed. in & BibTex; files are necessary only if the file is necessary to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the & BibTex files; files can also be written in & kile; written by hand.
The last selection field with the name Grotto is used for the definition of the font. it can be specified for the text of the text that joints, etc., etc., the following font features are available:
When calling & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and forbearing settings. 2. the document can be written on the basis of the document.
The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the font is determined. the font has not been established at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.
Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; -source code is compiled. the easiest way to use is the use of the building or button quick-growing.
The source code must be stored before compile. & kile; for storing the storage automatically.
If the compile of the document failed, it should be searched for errors in the protocol. if using quick-construction & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, also the logging should be considered.
An environment (English environment) is a text that will be different from the other document. for example, a report with the font size is 12, and only a couple of water is to have a different font. the command\\ 'can {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end} environment} is encouraged to provide the development of the font within the surrounding area.
Examples will only be saved within the environment (of\\\ 'environment} to\\ end {environment}). there are no restrictions (number) for people within a environment.
There are many opportunities to listen to the reading and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, subcutters, etc., will end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.
\\ 'Start {emph}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is closed for long as long as he will be closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ emph {word}.
\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ '{Quote} and ends with\\' {quota}.
After the background to write the source code with the & latex; -drawing language is shown, then a step-by-step-guide for creating a document in & kile;.
Once in the wizard, a bit text should be entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. for this reason, mind. a quotation, a few places in the fat and curiosities and a poem to the application occur to see the differences of these commands.
Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window has to be closed.
Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.
DVI; is a stable file format (engl. D e V ice I nap). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi edition like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screen windbreaks.
For printing a & DVI; file can be printed on the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - according to the click on DVI, then print the document using a file (in the viewer) you can print properly (if the printer is properly adjusted).
The toolbar illustrates the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion into a different formats can begin in the toolbar into the toolbar.
For the downward search, the direct jump from the editor for added position within the DVI; file.
& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. you just need to set up a Modern under Settings... tools Bauen.
To search for the precursor, the mouse indicator has to be positioned in one line of the source code and clicked on preliminary search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then checked.
With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & kile; it needs to set & kile; in & eyepiece; as text editor (setting eyepiece set up... Editor)
If using quick-construction of the & DVI; viewers do not need to suggest an error. if a bug is required, this will appear in the log file or in the news window.
The log file is the source of the source code in the source code. in the editor, the protocols can always be used in errors. in order to view the defective line, the log file must be clicked on the error in the log function, navigating immediately to the faulty line.
Once upon the corresponding button in the tool bar, a window appears to choose from the template for the document. pre-set menus are:
When selecting a complete document, a document can be used either by reason or the assistant to fast creating a new document. for more information on this section are included in the section.
Personal users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.
To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or create a new file. & kile; can create a new presentation by using an existing document and selecting a file template.
When creating a new document, a presentation by file New will set some strings through other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables must set up in attitudes (e.g. name or character).
To create your own presentation, it is therefore necessary to know which string chains are replaced by which variables:
$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is used through the input in document class. typically, they are used as "\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.
The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and that is used to use the commands in the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps have been completed:
When creating a new document, it can then be exposed to its own presentation instead of the standard.
A template can be created from any & latex; files created. will be a simple way to create a template, should be searched after one on the Internet and those under described steps are searched.
& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmability of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including also latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made out of menus directly from & kile.
To learn more about & Kate; and his abilities should be attracted to Kate. users from & kile; can be found there directly with the Reading of Works with the editor of & Kate.
& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command referenced, which can be called the Mention Help LaTeX reference, and can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.
Double-click with drunked Ctrl key to expire the & tex; this means that in this way you can read the\\ par of\\ 'bigskip only\\ par.
When pulling the text, the text is copied automatically into the clipboard.
When using the arrow keys, the source of the source will be irradiated in the editing window.
& kile; the ability to browse the various types of source codes and these are emphasized. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas differ by another color.
Many assistants can occur in a new type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entry is highlighted in the text or final mark. in this way, this jump brand is highlighted, so that it will automatically appear in the first input of a character.
The processor is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent mixtures were added; & latex; important functions for their selection. under editing, the following commands are included in the text selection:
Set out a complete paragraph (group of lines written on both sides). this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines, and latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only perverse thing in & kile; this is that the distance is separated by two empty lines.
If the word radiates under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also contains & latex; commands with an empty star (*) at the end.
To listen to a part of the document, it can be removed from this first, and can be removed by drums of the key. & Kate; offers the key line here. & kile; offering their own instruction for a faster tool. under editing, the following commands are provided for the text of the text:
Removed a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit output paragraph.
It has already been clear that environments can play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for more commands under editing environment for a sweet simple work with & latex;.
With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.
With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.
If the cursor is placed before or within the command\\ '{surroundings}, the end of the environment will jump (or vice versa).
When entering many polluting environment commands, quickly the view of the view can be lost. this command will close the most significant environment, so that the fusion structure is not disclosed.
& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that will be determined by staples {...}. under editing TeX-group are some important commands that correspond to those of editing environment.
This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the preferred bracket.
With this command, the current group will jump (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the clamp clamp.
When the cursor is before or behind the screwed clamp of a & tex; group # is, the other end of the group jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).
When typing many scrapped groups parentheses can be lost quickly to the view. this command will close the most recent group, so that the merging structure of the & tex; groups do not be disclosed.
In & latex; two basic materials are used as gene type. for the fitting the sign is used in & kile; the sign for the beginning will be used. & kile; this is the case and for two close registration number for & latex; one.
This automatic entry into the double enclosure can set up under Settings... LaTeX and will be turned off.
There are also many different languages (e.g. nought or French) and therefore German or French begining symbols. there are also many other languages available.
When using Shift, ONGABETASTE is for a smart line breaks. if the current position is located within a lists of the lists (e.g. the logs or itemize), it is a line of line but at the same time the command\\ item.
Close up & chile inside a tables environment; the current line with\\\\ with an attached line breaks.
Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to underline preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be made up under attitudes; set up... LaTeX to be added.
Some users include the columns in tables -environments, and all Et characters (amp;) each other. if this tabulator is not possible, it is possible to add & kile; after the most recent tabulator on the opposite line. although this tabulator is not the added value for the columns indicating the current Tabulators.
Although & Kate; already provides a good source release, this was added to & kile; in order to set special commands (mostly for & latex;), three are based on demand and the other two are designed for automatic watering. all these modes are set for different workplaces under Settings... properly set out.
When you start a new environment with the command\\ '{surroundings}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {ambient} according to an empty line (for the text).
When using the RÃ ¼ "bar, the last letter of the input will be removed, and thus the result is demarcted. on the other hand, the list can also be resized by entering a further letter.
All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are made to choose from a command. alternatively, you can find jumping stamps, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible through editing your marks, denominations, and the desired parameter will be available.
Adjustments kile; set up... kile; open settings for these lists. it can be used for different items for & tex; - and latex; -commands as well as solutions of the general language used.
The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. however, there is always a few letters with\\ must be entered. on the other hand, the environment will be used so often that & kile; a special mode for completion of environments is used.
When calling the editing mode, the command is automatically redesigned, or key, the command will be automatically redesigned and the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's environment can be resumed.
After all this is completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be taken.
Adjustments kile; set up... kile; open settings to these lists. this mode uses the maximum list of reference mode for & tex; - and latex; -commands.
& kile; underline user-defined lists of deviations, which are immediately set up by lapping character strings. the lists can be set up in the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.
For example, the code L-entered and the word processor mode is inserted, the letter L will be introduced by the string\\ LaTeX string.
Groforestry systems are not helpful for automatic translation. however, it has been found that many people are written in a document more than once. so it offers & kile; the capacity for all are already written.
This mode can be set up in the menu settings... Kile delimples. here, the swelling can also be specified for the ad placement.

PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer a superb basis for editing and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is enlisted, the pages are rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools are rearranged and then converted to ps2pdf into a PDF file.
To order the result of the job, the source code will be compiled. all construction tools are grouped into the volume of creating compiling, creating conversion and creating view.
For compile the source code for viewers such as & eyepiece; or another conversion can be used with Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file, and by Alt; 5 the PS file can be viewed.
When using the command button, a viewer normally is called upon the compile. should not be used inside viewer, so every time a new window will be needed.
A new project will be asked about the project's new project... Hierin will be asked for the following project:
When using the file name window, the relative path must be specified from the .kilepr project file.
The script function of & kile; allows for permission of ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed in the vertical edges.
The API scripts are not yet developed yet, and can be found in further versions of & kile;
The first must be said that the extraction environment of the scripts in & kile; a systematic object (= kile) has the following methods:
& latex; is a quite pronounced system in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of multiple packages. & kile; offers a lot of varied help to support the user.

A full Refracz for & tex; and its eÂ "free-deprivation." this is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a very rough manual for a particular formatting. as it is a very large document, it is divided into & kile; in three important reading marks.
Because of the amount of documents related to those & tetex; / texas; the use of the correct document is not always easy; the small application contains texdoctk, which contains a database with all to & kile; delivered documents and here a graphical surface area.
All documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for parcel name or punch boards. from & kile; only the results are displayed.

& kiss; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for emails. with the command-line interface you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list. this command-line interface provides the signatures for external e-mail programs such as & kmail;.
For random Signature, any signature is from the Signature file of & kisses; read out. by many signatures using different quotes, styles and information you can make your e-mails varied and unique.
For day trips the same signature is from the Signature file of & kiss; read out. for each day, use different signatures, as in the random Signature, create unique e-mails.
To create a new signature, select Ctrl; N file New. this way you get a lt; empty signature; and add the bottom section your new signature. signature-example Konqi-qi @ kde.org http: / / www.kde.org If you have entered your signature, save them with Ctrl; S file Save or click on the disk volume.
You can create any number of signatures. then you have a list of signatures for e-mail programs such as & kmail;. whether you use e-mails privately or professionally, there are always enough signatures.
To delete a signature, select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click the icon with the red cross remove removal in the toolbar.
Select the dialogue short command line. here you can select a short command from the list. in order to change a short command, select a action from the list. then click on the button to define the button and enter the new shortwave button by pressing the button or key combination.
For the use of & kiss; is & KDE; 3.5 required. to create signatures on your e-mails, you need a program like & kmail; or another program that can insert the signatures of a command.

The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all these tools use compression as surface and libxml2 and libxml2 and libxml2 and libxml2 and libxml2 and libxml2. the combination gives fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.
Everyone who has worked with the & KDE; -documentation has been on and how superior it is. do we still lift it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no longer on a terminal give it; simply the symbol for the XML-processor is clicked and finished!
This application expects an index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in the geveable workbook, then leave the current work folder. if not, then remove the selection of current workmen and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder.
Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all the previous & HTML; files will be deleted every time when mproc is started.
As already said, everyone who has worked on the & KDE; documentation has already been working, knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; now there is a great graphical interface for that.
If the just opened file index.docbook is, then simply leave the current work folder. if not, then select the current work folder and enter the file where index.docbook is available.
When it comes to a copy of the screen, your file is incorrect. please check the reported errors and try again.
If the file is already selected in & quantaplus; then let it simply delete the current file. if not, delete it in the current file and select the file via other file - File selection.
If they only want to know if the file is well-designed, they click the Well-to-check selection.
To use a & DTD file, which is specified in the & XML file, select & DTD; (external), otherwise & DTD; (external) and specify the location of the & DTD; using definition URI; specialization as well as for the RelaxNG verification is the configuration of definition URI; in the file selection required.
Yes, & quantaplus; also has an & XSL processing tool; this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.
If the processing file in & quantaplus should be selected, then release the current file simply. if not, remove the selected file and select the file using the other file file selection.
Specify the file name, as the result is supposed to have. the file is normally stored in their home folder.
The plugins, the & quantaplus; you may have to do with & quantaplus; therefore, the plug-in system is very powerful. you can't wait until someone can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements can be found below.
To install a plugin or a part, we start editing the plug-in menu. this is open the following dialog:
This dialogue enables you to manage and add all the plugins contained. we describe each & GUI; -ELEMENT in it:
Here you can enter the search path. adding plug-ins without a storage location used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-ins.
Often working on one project several people work in a form hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specifying team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.
The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the user's nickname and serves for clear identification.
One member may have several roles in the project, such as team manager and sub-project leader.
The user can choose from the list of Team Members, who he is. this is done by looking for the team member of the list and the button Setze than presses. currently, selected member (their identities) will be fat after you are: text.
Snickname and the setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and comments. see further information on comments.
In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by the members of the team: it can be created an event to the information to the team manager if something specific happens. see for further information.
Event actions are promotions that will be executed if something particular occurs in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project, as much someone has worked on it or the sending of a message when a file is secured, or a script that will be added to the CVS file, as soon as added to the project, etc;
On page event configuration of the shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog can be created, edited and deleted.
An email will be sent to the mailing list of the mailing list. the addressat can be a team or sub-project leader. see in, wei such conductors are set up.
Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:
To enter your comments is simple. either the comment entry from the editor-context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword in a comment-area followed by content text.
Comments can be sent to a determinative member of the team. in this case, the nickname @ annotation (nickname), or @ annotation (role), is a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Area Head and Subproject leaders, should be led to the range of appropriate or subproject names, such as in the following examples below.
Nickname and roll names are independent of large or small notes, but spaces around the brackets and the note: make the note invalid.
& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripts and formatting languages that DTD-gamtically is and web-based formatting and scripting languages supported.
The settings are reachable via the Settings menu. only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for others can be found in.
The settings can be set up using settings Quanta... called. this dialog covers some pages that will be treated after each other.
The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion, the entries can be changed.
Large / Lowerase of tags: large / Lowerase of automatically added tags. normal small / handwriting means tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the XML files.
Large / Lowerase of attributes: large / small censhrase of automatically added attribute. normal small / small notes means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the XML files.
Optional tags automatically include: if required, for tags that the exclusive day is optional, this is immediately after the & gt; inserted.
Not optional tags automatically include: as above all other tags, except for simple tags.
Start and finish tag automatically: when enabled, the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa.
Automatic translation of accent characters: controls the automatic transformation of accentuated characters in the corresponding codings during the typing.
MIME types: facial types to detect different types of files. using the default, the default settings can be restored.
Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in a different manner than with file open open files (where the encoding of the file can be approached), but this setting is displayed by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.
Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this attitude will be delivered from the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.
Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies. this is not the same as saving the file to backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for even not stored documents, backup regularly is created, according to the set time.
The preview and documentation can be shown either in the EditorArea or's own view (or the documentation in a cardboard box), which makes it possible to watch the documentation, preview, and source code at the same time.
Put the window setup back to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through the changing MDI-Modi and andocks / depend on views. it corresponds to the --resetting-command line parameters.
The warning messages range serves as taxes of the possibility to reactivate warnings by means of non-demand.
The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can change the ad instead of scripts as well as the synchronizing behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode. regards the different modes, see.
Here the parser and the structure-tree, which represents the illustration of the Parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in details.
In the mouse click on the structural tree, the following action causes the following action to change by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttonholes dissolved action.
In the structural tree settings the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically in the tree, the updating of the tree to the processing and how deep within a change of structural tree is scheduled to be stopped. empty nodes are the empty areas in text, while empty groups are found, with which in the current document no element was found.
The area for determining shortcuts (a kind of templates) that can be unfolds to a more extensive text. abbreviations are valid for several & DTEP; this means that the ifclause is abbreviated something different than in a group valid for Javascript.
Here you can manage plugins. plugins are available in the third part, which can be used by any part-able application, on the best known & Konqueror;. when insert a plug-in, the following features must be stated:
Address: the path to plugin, if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.
Entering: this information will be handed to plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding file (path of the current file) or the project folder.
Component in "Only-reading" mode: check if the plugin refuses the store. only-read-parts usually refuse to load the store when this option is not chosen.
Check the plugin: if this is activated, then testing & quantaplus; if the specified information is right, then the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.
For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was implemented, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which allows various implementations through plugins.
Currently only a plug-in is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.
The use of the debugger for a project begins with selecting a matching Debugger plug-ins in the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger Plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.
If a Debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:
A view in which the contents of monitored variables will appear. normally, in the left Dock appears.
A view, in which all hold points, listed with line numbers and conditions are listed in the lower Dock.
A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. normally, the lower Dock appears.
Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything is available or part of the following functionality.
With this action the connection to debugger, if necessary, made or shared the plug-in with, on Debugans. this action is enabled by default when a project is opened, so that a debugger must not be respected.
The counterpart to Debugal session starts the session. closes the link to the debugger or terminates the sounds of requirements.
Sends a HTTP requirement to a Debug requirement. this is synonymous with using a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger output.
Displays the debuggers to start with the execution of the script and to date information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line will be continued. if this happens while the script is started, the script will start with the request.
If this happens, the debuggers are to start with the execution of the script, without informing information to supervising variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is required, the execution will start before the execution will be made as soon as a request is made.
The Debugger will execute the next command in the script without entering the functions or includes.
The Debugger will execute the next command in the script, with which if possible in functions and includes adjusted faults.
If the debug suggests to go over and to the next so, if there is not the current one.
Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be supervised. the overeighth value appears in the variation view.
This dialogue may be entered a variable or set a new value of a variable.
& kxsl, is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl, is a & KDE; front-end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works from Keith.
This chapter describes how you can adapt and quantaplus; to adapt to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; help to become better.
Document type Editing Package (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; offering support & quantaplus; skills such as car finish and kiss to make. their simplicity and flexibility is made of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.
& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s included two file types, the page file and descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handmade, symbolified bodies of image buttons (above the Editier window), which may insert text and instructions faster in a document than one user may be.
& DTEP; s can be created hanging (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for details.
This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the descriptionrc; and also tool bar. briefly, an & DTEP;
TagXML files (.tag) define the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and the contents of the Featuresume; the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags in a document without any danger of writing.
Tag file are nothing but folder. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag file contribute to the name of the language-language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)
The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have better insight and more information about working with them.
The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is laid in simple ways.
This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only be found once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a only-element type about itself nothing else.
The tag type is a script function. when used & lt; attr > is an argument of the function. (only family 2)
Valid for the meeting class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)
Only valid for the type method. gives the name of the class where this method belongs to. (only family 2)
If yes, the day has a common attribute and attributes within that tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)
Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text > Tag. this is a only element element element.
Describe an attribute of a tags. this element can only be specified once for each attribute. additionally, it lays the name and the type of attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that should describe as this attribute is displayed & etc; This is a only item type element.
Specifies the source codes for the attributes in the tag Editordialog and the attribute tree in the attribute tree
Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.
Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology within & quantaplus; is used to submit the data source.
Requires source = dcop, an interface and methodology names. the arguments that are passed to the method. can be empty or% day name%, which means the name of the current tags.
A container that grouped together the elements of a list. it can only once occur for an attribute description. it is a only element element element.
Specifies the position of attribute of a tags within a dialog. this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr > -day). the element is empty.
Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be available for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr > and & lt; label > Tag). this item is empty.
There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a only element type.
There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.
All TagXML files must start with an & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0-8? > and must be tilled and closed.
Spaces does not affect anything, but pay attention & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip >, & lt; whatsthis >, and & lt; text > can be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.
To review the TagXML file, the tools dialogue at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check out TagXML. a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.
This function is currently not available. currently, checking only takes place at the store of the TagXML file in & quantaplus;.
In the following example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme > ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this day XML file should be schema.tag.
In the following example, an example for a working family 2 day XML file. this file is described a & PHP; overload function. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.
& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? > & lt;! DOCTYPE tags > & lt; tag name = "type" > & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / > & lt; / day > & lt; / day >
The & descriptionrc; file is as quite simple and there is an editor for it, reachable via DTD edit DTD settings; for one out of a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:
[general] version = version 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.
A action can set up with attitudes actions... to be created. click on New Action to the same dialogue:
This action assigned to the key shortcut. with clicking on the button, button1 buttons can be assigned, with Kone, the current keyboard snipple can be removed.
The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detector settings and inserted in the promotion of this text on the current cursor position. see the example below.
This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples of & quantaplus; themselves are the quickstart -dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEP.
First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.
Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripthum / scripts in the command line: global script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in command line:
% f: it will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document name is removed.
% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only an instance starts, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by external script.
The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.
In addition to the methods described above can be a script input from & quantaplus; on default input. in the box field input can be determined, which is to be sent to default. possibilities are:
Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.
According to the entry, the output of the executed application can be diverted. there are two types of output: normal edition, written on the standard issue. it can be stated that the text should be done with the text written on the default edition by selecting the box.
If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to provide the tags in logical groups. in this case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.
Once a tool added is added, you need to add actions and configure. select settings to set up actions.
The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button on the bottom of the window starts editing mode.
Fill out all necessary fields and add the day to matching toolbar.
Complete everything and, if the day attributes, and you plan their use, enable "edit dialogue" day if available to allow entry to use when using action.
Igouitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.
To create a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kicedit, use. select from the & kmenu;, chart other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).
& kiconedit; uses standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose editing size others.
Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.
With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least send a message to the user that Anols is a & lt; startled; -tag in the current document.
After creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with setting up actions. (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press him.
Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.
Press the button and continue with other tags, so there is still which gives, or confirm with OK to complete.
Suppose you want to complement several usual & quantaplus; -functions for the tool bar, or it should adjust this to a better overview of several separators in several groups. open the toolbars setting up dialogue with toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.
I want to specify the separator (at the left top) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that should be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.
For example, I want a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.
Please notice how the Trenner support the grouping. someone, who doesn't know my toolbar, might believe that the & Conqueror; button on the opposite of the start button.
The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols, to ensure that everything works.
Back in the correct file. after NeueXML does not exist, it will create impediordner, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct file. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded if a file is opened from the corresponding type.
Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal users is the opportunity to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -documentation-tree for my personal use.
Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; repository, if anyone has done this for you.
There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will give you the second we treat here.
# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top item = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = func2, tag3 = func2 = Conference 1 = tag2 = tag2 = tags.html
The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation about something:
# KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2 documentation = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Medition.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = long-syntax.html...
Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no famous limit for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.
Note that the contents of contents can be referenced directly onto a file (and consequently, the upper end of the tree vision & mdash; file is displayed!).
Spaces do not affect anything but pay attention & & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries be replaced.
The contents section is the area of docrc file, which is intended to display the context of context of context and pressures of Ctrl _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding.
A simple list of separate text elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).
Now you can simply save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc / $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (such as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there).
If you are sure that these are good and it's worth shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.
With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separator resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:
The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu entry, as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool comparative tool bar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree.
Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all others & quantaplus; users can download them and only available if our team needs them as correct and usfully for the publication. to use a useful contribution to what it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources are guaranteed, both for our team and later users.
When uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can find one out. in the new resource needs to be fulfilled (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK has to be started.
Upload the upload, upload, upload, toolbar, and files in templates and scripts in the context menu of the menu DTD DTD Package (DTEP).
After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.
It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not yet produced by & quantaplus; the creation can be more time consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in XML format. it gives the easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.
The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convergence of a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:
Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.
DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string that will appear in the DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / E http / / / www.w3.org / html4 / loose.dtd
The DTEP after conversion: if activated, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.
In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first introduce these concepts with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits brownish.
In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.
Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolbars about actions, everything is marked as globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this allows the group of administrators to secure promotions and patterns in the global tree that will be available to everyone in an multi-user environment on the system.
Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user.
Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything written in a specific project. it can be said that this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder, which means the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.
The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the EditorWindows, the building project, the box with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.
To view a context menu with the right mouse button, in order to obtain a context menu with the current document, like close to the current, other or all cartons, recharge, deleting or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS command to the current document.
Right click in the Editorfield lead to another context menu regarding the revised document configuration (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse pointing device or opening the file, if the string is named under the mouse pointing file.
At the upper end of the editor, the editor's tool is present. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as default, for which a proposition of toolbars are shown. in the course of further expansion of toolbars, the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thereby connected user needs.
The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to insert into this document, then click the symbol that represents the day. now, you can insert the data for this straight day. if you want to insert the data for this straight day (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.
The construction purposes (QIT;) allow to navigate into the information & quantaplus; navigate to open and push through. in the representation of boxes, project, sample templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of constructions are available.
Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mousec. actions such as adding, removal, upload or delete files from storage medium can be performed with the following context menu.
Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are available.
Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are usable in the project. more about templates.
Here you will find information about the available scripts in the Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send with e-mail.
This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-Click, the cursor position is set to the position of the element. by the right-Click of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.
This tree appears among other intentions. with it can change manoeuvise attributes and namespaces. this allows changing the content of all available attributes with a few clicks.
Here is the complete documentation to web-technology for your development. you can download the documentation of the quantaplus; 'document center can create their own documentation, and adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.
By default, & quantaplus; two cartons at the bottom of the window can be reached on the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.
This box shows information about each in Quanta running script. thus, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.
This box shows all errors in the check up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.
The & quantaplus; toolbars are expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the coolbox of the tool bar is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;
Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail;. if they get a tool bar in an email, they can assure them in & quantaplus; like any other secure and loading!
It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, Autoconf has a number of options that can be given to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.
If you have problems when starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the KDE; 3 bin file. also, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before her bin file. the same applies to & Qt.
& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.
During an effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible brand-up languages would be? well, this would make him the absolutely big web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.
No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized, if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus should be the appropriate & IDE.
Well, to the above claim, & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the complete & KDE; developer base is based. thanks to the & KDE; -affold not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; as they need it for their need.
& quantaplus; allows web development using an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. by using the program compression, they may need & quantaplus; it can be found without any scripts in scripting language. (more about it in.)
& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a fully-equipped editor with many powerful functions.
& quanta; Plus is in no way linked with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developer left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.
More detailed documentation is to help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / quanta execute).
& quanta; currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.
A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not located, whereby the oldest record is taken out.
This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the later use. check in section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project keepers, only a bug is reported.
Converted to insert from the clipboard there is a special sign to & HTML; -censhrase, so that they appear correctly and cannot be understood by the browser as formatting.
Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -notes, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.
Switches the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & shift; button to select.
Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages get out!
Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.
Shows the news window. that's the window where you see the display of scripting and debugger.
Exclusion and enrollment of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; the head of the problem is activated once you switch to the structure-tree.
Displays the symbol column left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.
If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries or next date, depending on the position of cursors in the document.
Bookmarks from other unopened documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.
Opens an existing project of the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.
Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.
Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a subfolder and add it to the project.
Reload the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods will depend on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (Kio Slaves).
Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project administrates. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects please explain the details.
Invites one project tool bar. these are kept in the project / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.
A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.
Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set up using settings. toolbars are stored in the toolbar of the toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.
Removes a tool bar from the visibility. it does not delete it from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.
This allows you to send their own tool bar (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the tool bar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as appendix.
Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where each other can access it. see in.
Load one & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description.
Loading / unloading of the dutities from the & DTEP; it is sensible when the dutities from the & DTEP; to renew the whole & DTEP; if this global one is not present and a write permission in the global KDE file is not available.
This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the current loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu Standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.
Allows access to the current day settings dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.
Activating or activating the intelligent insertion tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus is refusing, if this day is refuted on this place.
In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins listed below are listed below. click on. click on a activated plug-ins disabled.
Select the syndication mode for the current file. the list of available pre-emphasis is based on that; -Version.
Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.
Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application Tidy.
Immediate change between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is also the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.
In addition, this menu includes an entry for each open lower window. with a selection of a contract the corresponding window will be activated.
Shuts the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; primary coat.
The changes in this dialogue affects any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Konqueror; -web browser.
Directing the behavior of the Editorfenster. in the documentation of & Kate; you find details.
A dialog appears, where you can delete entries from the toolbars, or which can add or modify sequences.
This should create an assistance in the context of the mouse pointing, but is not implemented yet.
& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; -development in financial form, you will find the way here.
The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed by the top of the project, as after the fill of the project name, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later. all of these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.
Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file will be filled out automatically.
This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces using the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.
Here is the server address of the machine which you want to access one, except one processed local data. either a name (hostname.Ex.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.
If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log files are used. depending on the setting of the remote computer, an adaptation can be needed.
This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a joint collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard instead of the standard.
This is the folder in which the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and standard toolbars. if a joint collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard instead of the standard.
This allows to add files from local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.
This setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change. if you want to change your scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.
Defaults, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound. if a project is started anew, not anhaken.
This option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can suggest an exact selection of credits.
This shows a list of files in the main folder. one can select the desired files by Anhaken or, by removing the hamlets, clause from the project.
The last screen of the new project assistants includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be instantly upload or changed in the menu with Project Properties in the Settings Window, or with the Tasty Shift; F7.
Some settings correspond to those in project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.
A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folder.
Supplementary option to above, even files that are listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.
The project view, which will be charged when opening the project, can be read more about project views.
You can choose the desired debugger. currently only Gubed can be supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the button options. in this case, the troubleshooting is described.
In the lower window profile, upload profiles (see in) can also be discontinued, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile, by poke a own tree view for each profile.
In the lower window configuration, project members may be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details in details.
In the underwindow event configuration, one can turn the event actions, change or erase these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a certain event occurs, like the sickle of a file. see details in details.
By default it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not possible.
To open another project, choose project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the Project's Project will be displayed and allows to choose a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.
If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.
The project supervision provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be administrated in the current project.
Stewards behave as well, however, the entries are opening and open up with the right-up menu (press-up menu):
Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files. see.
Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is canceled to prevent the removal.
The password will retain in the core memory and forgotten in programist. this possibility is useful if common uploading of files is necessary and the more unsafe password to the record store option does not occur in question.
This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog, if you change your mind from the uploading.
In & quantaplus; you can create many high charging profiles and uploaded the project (or parts of the project) to various servers. using editing or profile, this dialog will be displayed:
This is the server name, to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.
The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.
The port for transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.
Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function, or a danger. use it after your discretion. password will be stored on the disk, so that it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in the original text.
A project view is only a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded into a project many views, i.e. by simply numb the view can be loaded several files and toolbars, and replace the currently open files and tool bar.
Views can be opened or deleted by the project toolbar, reachable via attitudes of toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.
This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this does not only boost its productivity, but also enables the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own workings.
As mentioned above, tool bar in & quantaplus; best referred to above the menu tool bar. use and add differ. adding tool bar is treated below in the section of toolbars.
The toolbars and symbols can be set up either by using context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, can set up other actions such as tool bar, tool bar code or tool bar, which may be specified in the dialogue, which may be displayed on this or other toolbars.
By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, in addition to the entries, remove and action labelled are shown that are self-explanatory.
The toolbars and the promotions of them can set up in the menu with attitudes of toolbars... and setting up the actions.
Templates are in essence documentation, code escalopes and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates like a common filesystem with extended organisation and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any at the system existing directory in the stock area. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you are preparing for the filesystem.
Some with & quantaplus; included templates have any conditions for their deployment. please read the conditions required at the beginning of each template.
Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file besides text, such images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted into documents using links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the stock market under global templates. more information on the templates tree is available.
Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. it is usually a simple report for the purpose and organises work in a proper way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the stock room under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree.
This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final note to Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the stock room under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree.
As the name says, these templates are used for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.
Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as template's template's template....
Once this is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project status) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project area below project facilities.
Select text in your document and click on file Report as template-save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn up with pulling and dismantle the designs.
The creation of binary templates is simple: the file only can copy only into a precursor. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and dismantle or inserting over the file-tree of Konqueror.
You can click on a folder or in the Project File Baumanhood to a folder on the right and secure site template to enter a name for the template and secure. by default, it is saved as local or global template.
Project suggestions enable a very target-oriented manner. you can adjust headline and footer and connect dynamically with & PHP; shape, insert files or link with them. additionally, one can keep some things with using templates in projects very deep in mind.
The template structure in the underwindow pad is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / template. each of this folder meets one of four types of containers, as described above.
To determine the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu, select the following dialog:
A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded when elteristic attributes are wasted.
This is enabled by default, and to activate everything except for the ancestor in the template. if a regular folder would turn off, it would appear to appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a pediordner.
Allows earlier or printed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headline or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of contents into a folder with special Headlines / footer to equip an entire presentation with the right header / footer.
In addition, we have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) about a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste the templates from one place to another.
& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second, the editing window will divide into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL file.
The VPL; Editor works as follows: it invites one document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and return as required for the source code editor, where the source code is displayed in the VPL file.
When working with VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandensor of & PHP; it is not possible to edit these directly with the VPL file editor. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change these behaviors.
The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes in the source code as well as in the VPL; editor synchronously works. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the key pressure is reset to the active cursor from a window to others, while the position is maintained in the document.
The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; -View you can automatically select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be set in addition. in general, the recommendation is for fast calculator and a large range of slow computer for slow computer.
Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags is possible with the VPL; -editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL file. this can be used to change the condition:
Meta-tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. key words for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added up or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows changing the Inhaltes, e.g. keywords on the column name and key word keyword keyword 2 on the content column.
CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in your browser. it can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible just as with the meta-elements. the edit of CSS rules is not currently supported.
It is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing the file button, and select the corresponding file.
The use of cursors is as in a word processor, by moving with arrows, possible. among rare circumstances the cursor will behave like usual. the marking can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted through rectipping and the back button or distance paste will be deleted.
The insertion of tags is made in the same way above the toolbars as in the source text editor. it is noted that the insertion of tags should not be removed before existing identical tags, i.e. an anchor tag, surrounded with text, every other surrounding anchor tag must be removed.
Some of the toolbars like the tables and the lists assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work in this release should be used the tables or lists of toolbars.
& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of style facilities. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style device can be persecuted.
To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile it, except & KDE; still need libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are available at a typical installation of & KDE; already available.
Stop in a template, at a place in one of xsldbg loaded back or xml file or at the current nodes. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, spoilt points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated.
Xsldbg determines the full path from a filename without scouts. filename in the same folder as the top-loaded style file name to a relativner con xsldbg is for example a style file system. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following entry is possible:
This command is checked to a partial or entire agreement with a proposal called QNAP's ME or a specified module name. & eg; template agrees with any QNAP ME that contains the string template.
Each namespace in the specified "QNAP" refers to the rules defined by the namespace in the XSL source file. xsl: test1 will be & eg; expands to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1
A sought-to-point support must be dissolved for the corresponding URI and line number. this will automatically reexamine the launch of the first template by xsldbg. retaining points are reexamined shortly after the start of each run.
Break -l & lt; FILENAMEgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;; (Set a holding point in the specified file and line number)
Break\\ * nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; can; (mounting point in * -template. other names that contain * will not be treated separately)

Disable -l & lt; FILENAMEgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (disabled a holding point in the specified file and line number)
Disable -l & lt; URIgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (disabled a holding point in the specified URI and line number)
Enable -l & lt; FILENAMEgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;; (activates or deactivated a holding point in the specified file and line number)
Enable -l & lt; URIgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;; (activates or deactivated a holding point in the specified URI and line number)

Skipping xsl: call-template or xsl: Apply templates. this command has the same effect as commands "step" and then "up"
Output & lt; FILENAMEs; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; can; (name of a local writable file. on Unix- and CYGWIN systems, the prefix "~" allows for environment variables under RISC OS).
Output & lt; URIts; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;; (In the & lt; URIts; may only be used for the file: / / -protocol. this is converted into a proper filename for the operating system)
If the option "searchresath" is specified, all output files are stored in this folder. otherwise, the folder of the style file is processed by search.xsl, with the option "prefrehtml" will be used in html.xsl.
When the command "search" is executed, a xml file named searchable .xml is created. this file can then be edited with a user defined style, if the option "preferring" is not set, the file will be searchable .txt file.
Depending on the quantity of the processing data, the execution of this command can take some time.
Search & lt; XPATHgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (information which XPath can be used, see searchable & lt; XPATHgt; is' / / search / * ')
Catalogs; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER _ VALUEgt; true, then the catalogs are used from $SGML _ Catalog _ Files or SGML $Catalogfiles for Risc operating systems)
Docile buttons; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER _ VALUEgt; true is and DocBook is supported by libxml, then the input document is a SGML-DocBook)
Preferential, nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER _ VALUEgt; true, then the search results will be issued in HTML format. see also the command "search")
Utroph8inputfree; (If & lt; INTEGER _ VALUEgt; true, then the user accounts receiveable in format UTF-8. this is usually used when xsldbg is executed as thread).
The maximum number of lines defined with gdb _ LINES _ TO _ PRINT is defined by the evaluation of the expressions, followed by ".." This value can be changed in the file options.h as default are three texts.
For the output of the expressions using cat / print the value value is "=" & lt; expression & gt;
(If & lt; INTEGER _ VALUEgt; is greater than zero (0), then the transformation & lt; INTEGER _ VALUEgt; -sometimes executed)
The value is wrong if the name of the option is "no" default, & eg; setoption nonet
Catalogs; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (The names of the catalogue used with put option "catalogs." the value is not used when this command is set before the "catalogs" option)
Searchresults; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; The path that is used to store the results of a search is used. if this value is not set, the path is used for style.
If there is a mode of templates, it will be added at the end of the incident for holding points. an example of this issue:
Source & lt; SOURCEgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; can be replaced with a new source file. a previous ~ is replaced by the value of the environment variable $HOME.
Template & lt; TEMPLATEgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (edition of details on presentation named & lt; TEMPLATEgt;, when the template was found)

Walk & lt; SPEEDLE; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Ctrl-c stops the version, & lt; SPEEDs; must be 0 to 9, 1 very fast and 9 very slowly)
& xsldbg; is a program for troubleshooting (debugging) in XSL (XSL = Extensible Stylesheet Language). & xsldbg; has similar orders like the Unix / Linux Debugger gdb. there are three ways to execute a style template:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starts a shell. then enter the & xsldbg; -command "help" to get an overview of the help.
Add the parameter with the name & lt; NAMEs; and the value & lt; VALUEgt; added to the XSL environment variables. see also the documentation about addparam "
Does the conversion speed 20 times out if --split-two is specified, the conversion will be 100 times.
The input documents are treated as HTML files, when the support has been activated in libxml
Activates the XInclude processing of an input, if the support has been activated in libxml, which is enabled.
On systems with installed Readline library you can turn the arrows on / off by the running memory of the commands so far.
Several commands require more than one argument. quotes signs can be used to put together expressions than an argument. & eg; * _ BAR _ @ quot; "as argument, a holding point is set in a file named" break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;. "
Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a fully qualified name as "xsl: templateName."
Filename: a valid local filename on the system of users. on Unix- or Cygwin systems, the name may have the prefix "~" as a short form for personal files. on RISC-OS systems, additional environment variables are allowed.
Path: a path to change the working folder. on some operating systems, the prefix "~" will be replaced by the path to your personal folder.
Data: the XML-data or the XML _ document, which is processed by the style template. see also & lt; FILENAMEgt; and & lt; URIts;
Running time commands: {bye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ quit}, step, stepper, stepping down, next, Continue, run, trace option, options
There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.
The merging was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time had corrected the influence on many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in merging.
The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed in this lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the insertion had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.
This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be seen in a row and changes to white characters. later, any amount of additional useful functions were added.
If you want to compare it quickly, easily copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.
A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.
Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons consist of each other in a piece of code and changes changes. the merging editor under the differences between conflicts and shows simultaneously the result of the expected outcome. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot is showing three quell files at merging:
& kdiff3; also helps with the comparing and merge complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:
& kdiff3; displays the exact differences, and also refer to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently use Kode, you will like this function.
Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side of the left. (no more trouble if someone changes the deposit.)
When one file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.
If all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify your work by simply write the file name of the first file. example:
Kdiff3 folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder 1 folder
The open-dialog enables manual type of filenames, select the selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last updated file from the list. you don't have to specify the third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.
Via the button file... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparing or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, however, use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.
When merge is crossed, the input field is active for the target and process itself. however, it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file. you can do this step later when saving.
The set button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before you start merge with the same / merge.
Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. compared to open dialog you don't have to select files you can easily close the dialogue with the button.
You can also drag and drag it: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.
What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar are these functions, it would have only two corresponding files to copy them into & kdiff3; download and then compare these relevant sections. you can then simply copy and compare the relevant sections.
Note: there is currently nothing from & kdiff3; pull out. only the flaw of text into a comparison window is supported.
Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copy and insert). in such a case, your original data may be lost.
In the upper part of each text box is the info-line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse display a while on the line.)
The three sources of sources are the letters A, B and C. a color blue, B is the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed through the settings menu.)
When a difference is recognized, one can see on the colour which file differs. if both files distinguish themselves, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is very useful if you compare three files. that is well visible in the next section (merge).
Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individuals relevant.)
The vertical line, which separates the summary column of text, is interrupted at the places where the source file is activated, when the line file is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.
The earnings window (below the comparison list) also has a info-line with the inscription output:, the filename and [it changes] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.
!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next deleted / unusually conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)
If only two comparative Americans are used, each difference has to be resolved at the same time.
By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the first line of the group will appear in all windows and the first line of the group will appear at the beginning of the group.) This group will be highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background colour for current area and the left will appear on the left.
Sometimes the automatic merging or manual processor remains no more line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the quelop; displayed. this text is not displayed in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you may copy and insert somewhere else.
The text & lt; costumers; however, appear in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. be careful with this function.
Note: if selecting the sources, ignore the options, or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are dealt with as white characters.
Navigate mainly with the image running and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard right, right, bottom, down, page on, side down, at the end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the oversizing column can also be used through the vertical image bar.
In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insert button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)
A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section) and the editing window (explained).
The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict.
To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg insert), whatever you mark is automatically copied and the manual copying happens. be careful with this option however, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.
Zeilenenden are stored according to the existing operating system. UNIX-variants use a line-feed characters\, and Win32-based systems use the line-saving of the source files\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-saving of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.
The options and the list of the last used files will automatically be stored and restored to the next start. (menu entry - > KDiff3 set up...)
Select a writing with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width, you should not use this.)
When activating this option, differences are shown in italic script. if the selected scripture does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.
On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colours might not be available in pure form but would be rendered rendered. on these systems the button preferences will automatically create an unjust color.
When this option is activated, the pressing button will be inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, an tab character will be inserted.
If you enter or press Return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.
If this option is enabled, any selection will be copied automatically into clipboard. the manual copying into the clipboard then falls.
You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.
When comparing files tries & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines will be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can't be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. even when merging will not be ignored.
Some editors (on some systems) save a car backfeed '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes on page-to-side comparison, but then files are treated with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison, however, as a white sign will be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled.
In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.
This option is deactivated. changes in comments will be handled as changes in white characters.
Intense after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.
In automatic-jump mode, this attitude will determine how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next level of the conflict will continue.
Dissolves all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if the automatic selection also need to be less important in numbers or comments, if the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore these or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.
These options are covered in the chapters to scanning the folders and through a merge. look for details under documentation to the directory and merge.
If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be the Suffix .original appended. if already such a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without further backup.
Fits the language of user interface. the Change of this option is not currently running the current program. you need to finish & kdiff3; end and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE-version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre.)
The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activates this option, the upper adjustment is used for all entries.
About the selection fields for encoding appears a short note, what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)
Customize the file code for source files. this influences such as special characters, and interpreted as special characters. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, can be compared and collaborated with different encoding.
If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding should be used to save.
If you define pre-processing command, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could handle 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).) With this option you can define the coding of the output of preprocessing command.
Turn this off to suppress pre-curtain of changes in white characters in text or testimonials. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options ignore these or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)
This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded survival column. but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files. after choosing A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal one second transfer column with the required information.
Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply remove the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)
Arranges the comparison window by side or each other. this may also be useful to display long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)
Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts to compare the merge file as a default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the file name, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)
When reading a file, it will first be delivered to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is precisely your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut off-out parts or to correct the insertion.
When reading a file, it will first be given to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is specified. the output of the command is only used in line. you can write your own preprocessor, which matches exactly your requirements. each entry-line must have a corresponding edition line.
The idea behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users want to program this too. however, the good news is, however, sed in most cases or perl complete.
Use this preprocessing command to convert the input in capital letters: SED'S /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'character sequences.
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add character strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all following the same pattern is required: SED's /\\ $\\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
While you experiment with experimentation, you may be able to understand it and perhaps you may have these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.
The Ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further preprocessing command to be inserted. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.
Sometimes you might want to perform several targets on once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate parts from each other. example:
Instead, you can also use some other details e.g. perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' However, perl need some details differently at perl. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the earlier '\\'. for example:
The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and assembling. the further operations only change the data that can see the line-off-algorythmus.
Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like-processor is the output of the normal pre-processor processor.
The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text changes or differences, you may not notice certain differences, and destroy important data in the worst case.
Often you need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.
... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adapt the proposal before the start,
... can the merge simulate and shows the simulated changes without it really,
... will execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),
This is very similar to comparing and merge of single files. you only have to open files on the command line or in the dialog file.
When three files are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no target file is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as a target file.
Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merge. to restart, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)
While reading the folder you will notify you a small news window about the current progress. if you break the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to the date.
When scanning the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list with the results on the left,...
Each file and each folder, while the scan is found, is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.
The folder structure is usually folded, by clicking on the + / - click, or click on the object, or by clicking the arrows keys to the left / right. the menu menu contains two functions of all subdirectories, and open all subdirectories, with which you can open all the folder.
If you click on a file, the file system is started and a comparison window appears.
The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:
If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case the merge clock action can not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about the problems of this type.
As in the above picture you can see in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.
In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.
Files are considered identical, if its overall content is identical. then you also have the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its color.
The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colours of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow is and later, when it is old, red becomes red.
... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)
... A and B identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)
... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)
... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects cannot be started.
... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.
The mode for synchronize is active when only two folders and no explicit target file is provided, and if the option synchronize directories will be active. then dial & kdiff3; the necessary action, which are identical to both folders. if for an entry...
... A and B exist, but not identical: merging and save the result in both folders. (the user can only see the visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after Merging & kdiff3; B after A.)
If two folders are merged and select the option of new file instead of merge (uncertain), then check out the file's file. if the files are different, but the same date will be different, but the date is identical.. solange such errors can not be eliminated, the merge file can not be started.
While assembling a file is working after the others. it status-column indicates that when the merging was successful, and according to other messages, if something unexpected can be completed, you should check out a final review and see if the status is alright everywhere.
If in the setup dialog The file comparative method is selected, KDiff3 will show more columns. these contain the number of unpowder, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or grouped.)
You can select either the selected entry (file or ordner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge clock actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merge.
Please note: if you don't have a target file, then in the Three-folder-merge mode C, it will be selected as the target and used to synchronize A and / or B as a target.
If you choose a target file, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target file, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped through certain entries. check out these options to avoid unloving surprises:
To bring all entries together, select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keynote). to merge only the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.
If there are still invalid data types still exist, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid promotion.
When you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options executed, simulate, and abort.
Choose Simulate if you'd like to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.
& kdiff3; then takes certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window (notice the screenshot).
When you're done with a file, select your directory together / continue or press F7. if you haven't been saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work continues with the next entry.
If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some errors that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you want to restart the problem, or to solve the problem of problems or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge.
If some entries have been merged individually, you'll notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and execute it again later. even if here the merging might be skipped or not stored, these entries will be changed again. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.
The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - > KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:
Only files that match the specified pattern will be displayed in the Elementum. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid places: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.
Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the elementary-tree. it can be entered in more than one pattern, use semicolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.
Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the elementary-tree. it can be entered in more than one pattern, use semicolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.
Ignore files that will also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be specified with a .cvsignore file. (check under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)
In some file systems files have a notch attribute. in other file systems, a file system marks a file as hidden. this option allows you to decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary-tree or not. this option is enabled in default.
Where links to files: when the option is switched, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, files are compared to which the links are displayed. this is deactivated in default.
When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared with default. if the option is switched on, the links will be handled as normal files and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3) will not be checked on possible recursions. a link to a file that will lead to itself and take off.) This option is switched off on default.
Does a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns. (the number dissolved, unpowder, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)
If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be easier to compare the change date and file size. please use caution. please use caution. this option is off on default.
Similar to confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical. that can be useful when copying the expiration date. please use caution. this option is off on default.
Activating the synchronizing mode, if two files are compared and no target file is specified. in this mode, the proposals will be identical, and the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is displayed in default.
In case there are differences, instead of merging copying the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe, because it is provided that the other file has not changed too.) This option is displayed in default.
If a file or a file is replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. if an old backup file is deleted with the .original extension already exists, this will also affect the normal combination of single files, not just the merge file. this option is enabled in default.
Normally, the folder-merge view is visible in combination of single files; you can turn the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can turn the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.
Probably you prefer to compare a file via double-click menu. however, in the directory menu, you can also use a single file directly. as soon as you save the result, the status is set to be done and the file will not run once you restart the folder.
However, this status is lost, if you read the directory again: directory menu: read new
KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders there, which are located on local or remote computers.
The first command line compares a local file with one FTP-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archiv with a local folder.
A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. some things should be noted:
A path can be relatively. or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.
Special characters must be masked. (# - >% 23, blank >% 20, etc.), for example, has a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.
Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:
Or it can't be distinguished if a link is shown on a file or folder. then always a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, SFTP:).
There is no way to process permissions or change of change. therefore, deviations or change of change from the original. (note: this is only possible for local files.)
The main configuration is currently regarded as differences reflection in KDevelop. KDevelop begins to start the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.
Usually you need & kdiff3; two complete input files; if it is used as a part, takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files in the Unified format. then degenerates & kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch has to restore the missing file.
In the Konqueror click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, it is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.
If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small factory and menu. the merge or the comparing of folders will not be supported in the part mode.
Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heist es) is already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it may merge the program diff3 out of the diff tool collection.
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by doing other programs in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go for it.
You probably have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script to KDE. in the default installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.
If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be identical as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line is not identical to Each to Each other, this folis. but this folis often the case.
The editor remembers every difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. however, that's necessary to solve a conflict by clicking on the source code and select the button 1 / B / C. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file, and it is too much effort to design extra a file format that could store this information.
The effort for this was so far too large. you can always be able to restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.
After removing text is suddenly lt; no src left; appeared and the text is not extinguished. what does it mean and how can it be removed?
& kdiff3; many colors are used to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.
Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people out of the wild wild. thank you!
To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.
For information, how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.
A list of the latest changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.
To compile and install on a system with & KDE; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:
KDE-dir gives the folder in your system installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.
Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake utilized, you shouldn't have any problems with compile. should still be difficulties, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists.
Cut out (Ctrl-X or switching old) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or switching) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current mark.
Only differences: files that are identical in all types of folders are not in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target file.
(in the current program version, you need to read the folder with the function actualization tool.)
There are only entries to exhibit the differences that identical files will not be copied to the target file. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing in a later program version (the behavior will likely change in a later program version).
Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in earnings window (if they are not already present), so if the lines are already available, click the button according to the button.
In default, this option is deactivated. underdifferences in single character (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.
The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working spaces to end its size, finish it or move it. this works both within a desktop and also with multiple.
The & Kpager; can view all virtual workspaces, as well as the applications that applications can be selected, and can even be moved on Desktop and other.
With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other workspaces.
The context menu depends where the right mouse button is based on the empty background of & Kpager; but if it is clicked on an application within & Kpager; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimizing, maximize, Desktop and Finish.
Maximizes the application window on the full size of desktop. appears only if it has been clicked on an application.
Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only if it has been clicked on an application.
If the checkbox is marked, windows can be moved inside the & Kpager; the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas are postponed.
When this field is crossed, the & Kpager is displayed; the name of the virtual workspaces are displayed.
Anchor this field leaves the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual workspaces. it is together with name, the names are provided with ordained figures, & eg; 1st floor.
When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the & Kpager; displayed.
When this box is crossed, the running programs will appear as a small window in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces are displayed to allow the selection.
Here the view of the program window is selected. simply showing simple rectangles with the proportions of the program windows. icon displays the window with their standard symbol and pixel. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.
Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main compartment can be specified: classic leaves & kpager; in some other windows are known; horizontally, all virtual workspaces are located in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical line, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.
The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniature in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display window as symbols or with its content. in addition, it runs outside the control bar.
To set the right mouse button inside & Kpager; and set up the exit switch... lets the dialog appear.
At the moment this can not be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:
Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kinserrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission for the file, you'll need to register as user root or apply to your system administrator. in this file, you must apply the key windowsy mode and show this value. possible values are:
Da & Kpager; part of the package valve base, you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.

& kiss; is a screen pitch. you can use with & kmag; you can read a part of the screen. this application is interesting for different users. this application includes artists, web designers and people with a vision. this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of & kmag;
& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded by new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance machines.
When you start & kmag, a window appears as above. the main window of the screen. in the following, this window appears as a magnification window. the picture that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged area of screen and is described as a select window.
In the default setting increases & kmag; the area around the mouse indicator as an eventful lue. alternatively, you can use & kmag; to set a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection mode) or the setting of the mouse pointing at the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).
If you want to avoid the mouse pointing out in the enlarged window, select the mouse option. please note that the mouse configuration is still able to recognize the form of the mouse pointing. this is always the standard KDE; / Qt; -mouse pointing.
In drop-mode mode, you can change the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrows and moustaight and change its size. this can be done in the following manner:
Move the mouse pointing out in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can shift the contents of the magnification and move. this also goes with the arrows keys.
In addition, if you are using the Shift & Shift; button or the & MMB; use the selection window.
With this combination, you can change the size of the drop-down window. note that the top-left corner of the radio station remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.
& kiss; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, in a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), turn the picture and much more.
Starts or stops the updating of the display. the stops of updating causes the required CPU time to 0.
Select the actualization rate (Very low, low, medium, high, Very high). the higher the actualization rate, the more CPU time is required.
In this mode, a select window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.
& kiss; automatically uses your set-set short command to save files, open a new window, printing, newcomers (with the button document loading up in & Konqueror;), enlargement and clutors & etc;.
May also be known as & kissing fier; it is a screen menu. you can use & kplacfier; to use a range of screen, as if you would use a magnifier to look at the small printed in a newspaper or a photo. this application is used for various people from benefit: from researcheur or artists to the web designer or visually impaired.
Detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmag (specify either this URL to the address strip of & Konqueror; one or launch a helpcenter help: / kmag).
& kimfier; has been developed by Olaf Schmidt ojschmidt @ kde.org and Sarang Lakare Sarang @ users.sf.net and Michael Forster Forster @ fmi.uni-passau.de.
& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse pointing out for a while at the same point. it's meant to help people suffer from the RSI syndrome (repetitive strain syndrome) and which each mouse click is prepared.
& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse pointing out for a while at the same point. it's meant to help people who emulate the repetitive strain of Injury (RSI) syndrome, and those every mouseclick can emulate pain. however, this requires a bit of exercise.
& kmousetool; can handle pain using the mouse button, and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may suffer pain that are related to the use of your computer, you should look for a doctor if this is not done.
To avoid it again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid the clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain, which is used through the moving of the mouse, and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can fall differently for each.
The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement briefly.
If the smart processor is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break, after leaving the mouse button, wait until the end of the motion. in this way, you can run the pulling in pressed mouse button. the smart shifting requires a bit exercise, but you get used to it quickly.
This refusal must be musty after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.
If it is switched on, the shooting field is switched (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after the suppress of the mouse button, before the mouse button is waiting again, if there is no reference to the mouse.
& kmousetool; supports the click through mouse shift. is this function activated by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back is saved if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.
If the sound is delayed, you can shortened the reaction time. go to Sound & Multimedia, choose the sound system and here the tab General. there is a sliding-buffer sound buffer that you can set on a lower level to reduce the response times.
If this adjustment is checked, & kmousetool; at each start of & KDE, started. this function is currently only available at GNOME or other window environments, to find out the respective documentation to find out how to restart a program there.
Sets all the settings to the values, which were set when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button, the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressures of users.
Best use & kmousetool; first with presetting. in particular, the smart processor should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart shifting.
If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & KDE; if necessary.
First you should make yourself aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in browser window that cannot do a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.
If your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite easy. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that comes with the mouse ball in touch.
First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens is from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.
If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. dirt and soiling can easily scratch with a flat blade or finger nails.
In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the version of & kmousetool; if you're just going to move the smart processor, this means that & kmousetool; the surgery is no longer able to end the mouse button.
This happens if you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.
The solution for this problem is that you self-run a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool; back and you can work as usual.
Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool to execute clicks and sets the cursor to another place.
Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but saving the mouse on a neutral area of Desktop, if you want to pick it up. secure zones for the mouse indicator are & eg; the grey surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.
I try to work with smart processor, but I don't create it to edit text.
The smart processor is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you handle it. it's very well possible to copy it into the clipboard or move back any other action in which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button. but there are probably some problems with them. here are some advice:
Use the smart processor if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. select text instead at the end of the text area a mouse click and hold the switch-button, while you move the mouse pointing to the other end of the text and re-press the mouse button.
Use the audible mouse click. this will be done every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button puts a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the smart processor without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.
To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X window; installed, which should be the case for most of the system.
The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers, and they are set correctly.
& kmousetool; conducts the mouse button once the mouse pointing shortly. this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and those of the moustaight pain is prepared.
& kmousetool; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is started. in this way, pulling and dismantle with the mouse can be performed.
More detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmousetool (specify either this & URL; into the address strip of & Konqueror; one or start dhelpcenter help: / kmousetool).
& kmousetool; was developed by Gunnar Schmi Dt Gunnar @ schmi-dt.de, Olaf Schmidt ojschmidt @ kde.org and Jeff Roush Jeff @ mousetool.com.
& kmouth; is a program that allows the dumb user to speak to their computer.
With the program & kmouth; dumb users can talk to the computer for themselves. users can choose from a list with the discerning character phrases which are to be spoken once again.
On the first page of the wizard (linking screenshot), enter the command, which later is used for the speech output of text. more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog.
On the second page, select the standard text editor. you can often select text passages without them to tap. the text passages can be processed naturally.
On the third page (right screen photo) you determine the dictionary for the Worterial. & kmouth; reads the language documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words. in addition, you can exchange the word lists using an OpenOffice.org dictionary.
The main window of & kmouth is clearly and contains essentially an input field for the keystrob of your propositions (the lower white field on screen photo) and a run memory of the already spoken phrases (the upper white field in screenshot).
If you like kmouth; right, you can enter the sentences you want. every sent proposition is attached to the cache memory. you can select from this propositions that are to be spoken once again.
With the menu entry kmouth; set up... open the dialog dialog by & kmouth;. this dialog contains two card cards, speech output and settings, the page of Worship Accessibility and the page KTTSD language service.
In the input field of the card statement, you enter the command's command. in the box field below the input field you specify the character encoding, which will be transferred to the language generator.
& kmouth; knows two types to pass the text. select the checkbox, if the text remains unchanged as default on the speech generator.
If the checkbox is not selected, the text is displayed as a parameter. you can use the following placeholder:
Of course, the command depends on the speech output of your language generator. you will find this command in documentation about your language generator. examples are found in Appendix.
With possible language service as language service, & kmouth; as first try to pass the text to the KTTSD language service. if that is successful, further settings are available on this page. the ktond language is a standardized interface for language output and that is currently being developed in SVN. the option of this option is meaningfully, even if KTTSD is not installed.
The first selection field after selecting a text passage, determine which action is triggered by the keynote or by selecting a text passage in the text password textbook or in the box for text passagenbücher.
With the selection of Soon, the chosen text passage is directly spoken and inserted in the cache memory. the selected text passage is only entered in the input field first.
With the second selection panel, you can specify whether the textbook book is to be stored automatically at the closing of the editing window.
Store the book stored in the book password. if you select changes, the text file book is not stored. select before saving, will be saved & kmouth; ask if the text file is to be saved.
The site of Worship's limitation includes a list of dictionaries for the time limit. in the main window next to the input field shows & kmouth; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary. this list is currently used to select the used dictionary.
With the buttons on the right, you can delete dictionaries or add them to the order of books, or export them into a file. below the list you can set the name, and in the box, you can set the language for the dictionary.
For this source, choose the desired language; & kmouth; reads the & KDE; documentation one. the frequency of individual words is simply determined by enumerating the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert just correctly described words into the new dictionary.
With this option you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then asks which dictionaries should be merged, and how this weighted.
With this option you create a new, empty dictionary without entries. da & kmouth; re-issued words automatically insert into the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time.
The main part of the window to the processing of text fitting holes is divided. in the upper part, the text file sheets are represented as tree structure.
In the bottom part you can edit an selected entry. if you select a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated program scripts. if you select a textbook book, you can only change its name.
Actions such as new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting the menu bar, in the tool bar or above a folding menu.
You can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by drag the mouse to the new site or with the arrows keys and the & Alt; key.
The chosen text is cut out and copied into the clipboard. if in the input field a text section is selected, it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the memory card.
The chosen text is copied to the clipboard. if in the input field a text section is selected, it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the memory card.
The currently active sentence is spoken. if text is located in an input field, it is used, otherwise the selected sets of the memory card.
If this menu entry is crossed, a pushable tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands. the tool bar is arranged by default via the edit menu. by mouse click on the shaded left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot.
If this menu entry is crossed, a narrow body is in the lower part of the main part with clues over the state of & kmouth; displayed if not crossed, this status bar is hidden.
If this menu entry is crossed, the bar box is shown by default on the processing window directly under the toolbar. by mouse click on the shaded left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another spot.
Probably you have not entered the instruction for the language issue right or not completely entered. open settings kmouth; set up the page of General Settings and enter the command of the language output on the card reader edition. (see the dialog dialog for Language synthesizer to further details.)
Festival is a copy system of the University Edinburgh. currently only English, Spanish and Walisisch are supported. the license allows to use the festival for free to use and without restrictions.
To show an example of the command line for the placement of the language output, it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival. the command of the speech is then:
FreeTTS is a written language generator. currently, it only supports the English pronunciation. the license allows you to use FreeTTS for free and spread it without restrictions.
To show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language output, FreeTTS is installed in the / usr / local / freett file. the speech output is then possible with one of the three following command examples:
For the third example, the option must be enabled as default input. (this is the recommended example for the use of FreeTTS.)
MBROLA is a language generator for many languages. he converts a list of phonemes into a Wavematei, so you need an additional program to dismantle the text in phoneme. the license allows to use MBROLA for free for non-commercial and non-military applications.
In our example, Hobfax is used to convert German text to phoneme for MBROLA, including the assumption that Hadifax and MBROLA are installed in / usr / local / hadist and / usr / local / mbrola.
Unfortunately, Hobfax would like to be swallowed up the last character of the text, so an additional character must be added. the complete order is therefore more expensive than in the other examples:
(Cat -; echo quot; & quot;) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mbrola / mbrola -e / usr / local / mbro.wav; artsplay / tmp / tmp.wav; rm / tmp / tmp.wav
All parts of the command must be written in one line. the option is to send data as standard input.
The speech-demon of & KDE; (KTTSD) is a & KDE; -on language service that is available to all & KDE; applications have developed a standard interface for language output. KTTSD is currently being developed in SVN. it uses modules to support various language output systems.
As the language's adjustment is done only in the KTTSD, you only need to be used as language service as language service in & kmouth; set.
To setup, use the KTTSD language service that appears in the dialog box of & kmouth; appears when KTTSD is installed.
To use & kmouth; successfully use a language generator (and of course & KDE; 3.x). & kmouth; requires approximately 15 MB memory (and additionally memory for the language generator), which depends on your computer and its configuration.
& kmouth; is an application that can't speak with people who cannot speak text by the calculator. it will have a list already taken propositions, which the user can always be recreated again.
Note that & kmouth; no language synthesizers. on the calculator, a language synthesizer must be installed.
More detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmouth (specify this URL to the address strip of & Konqueror; one or launch a helpcenter help: / kmouth).
& ktts; - the language edition system of & KDE; - is a service provided by modules of existing service that enables each application to read text on the & DBus; interface.
& ktts; is a sub-system in & KDE; for speech output (TTS). it provides a common application interface for & KDE; programmers ready to be equipped with their applications with TTS capabilities. it also offers interesting opportunities.
Read texts (or parts thereof) in text editor & Kate;, even if & Kate; in other & KDE; -applications embedded.
The speech output is performed via the program speech dispatcher, the different background program such as espeak, festival, & etc.
Allows the creation of language spending on the command line (or with shell scripts) via the & qdbus; -relief program.
In the future: support for speech-up languages such as VoiceXML, Sable, & Java; Speech-Markup Language (JSML), and Speech-Markup-Meta-Language (SMML).
The language edition service of & KDE;, an application without visible windows that offers TTS services via & DBus; offers.
An application with & GUI; to configuration and set of kttsd about kttsmgr in the system section.
One module for the web browser & Konqueror; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof.
A module for the text editor & Kate;, with which a text file can be read or partially read.
In addition to the Bugzilla database of & KDE; (http: / / buud.kde.org /) find discussions about & ktts; in the KDE-Accessibility mailing list. subscribe to the list on https: / / mail.kde.org / mailman / listinfo / KDE-Accessibility. the developers can also be found in IRC (irc.kde.org, channel # KDE-Accessibility).
Before you & ktts, you need to install program speech-dispatcher and adjust correctly. see also
When there is no speaker for the first start of kttsmgr or so as yet no speaker is shown, the card details will be shown. see also. if you have set at least one speaker, the card card is listed. see.
Most TTS Synthesizers offer different languages and voices, such as various male or female, or such that distinguish themselves in volume or speed. you can also set several variants for a synthesizer; you should at least set a speaker before you & ktts; use as the program speed dispatcher uses the standard loudspeaker.
Various speakers for the same synthesizer are comparable to several pressures for the same printer.
If you click on the card reader speaker at kttsmgr, the map image will be displayed automatically when you start a ktmgr and yet no speaker is established.
All speakers already appear in this list. the preferred spokesman appear in the list. the top speaker is used for voice output if any application does not provide a speaker.
With a mouse click on the list below, and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list.
Select a mouse click on the list below, and click on the button to change the settings. see below.
With a mouse click a speaker from the list, and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down. the order of the spokesman in the list also determines its priority.
Click on the buttons to apply your changes to the current & ktts; system.
Choose here a vote type, there are three male and three female voices as well as a june and girls voice to choose from.
If you click here, appears on the new speaker on the card speaker. to change the settings of this speaker, click Edit.
Now you can use & ktts; already almost use. go back to the card configuration and check that the TTS service from & KDE; start. see. now you can use & ktts; use to read text files. click on the card ticket to create text orders and manage text orders. see.
If you have at least one speaker, you can launch the language listing of & KDE. click on the map traders to open this card card. here, you can set some general options.
Mark the checkbox to activate the & ktts; this starts successfully, the card card is displayed, and you can create text orders and read them. see. remove the marking, will be KTTSD and the TTS-System of & KDE; deactivated.
When kttsmgr is terminated, runs & ktts; next, if the field is checked (KTTSD) is crossed.
If the checkbox is marked and kttsmgr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar, it disappears once the reading is completed.
With the buttons in this series you can start text orders, stop, stop and record again.
With the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the & KDE; read the clipboard or open a text file for reading. you can also change the speaker for an order.
Click on Apply or OK, then all changed settings are taken over to all sides.
The card ticket orders will only be shown if KTTSD is started. to launch KTTSD, click on the map traders and activate language output (KTTSD).
In & Konqueror;, the web browser of & KDE;, you can read the text of the displayed website. check out the text which is to read, and select the main menu tools reading. after a short time, the language edition should start.
It is almost always convenient to mark the desired text of a web site. you can also skip this step but then many & HTML; -pretener lines and other unseen brands are also read.
In & Kate; the extended text editor of & KDE;, you can read the displayed text. check first the text which is to read, and select the text, read the text editor. then the language edition should start.
This also works if & Kate; embedded in other applications such as & eg; in & Konqueror; or in & quanta;.
KNotify is the message system of & KDE; you can notify you of recent events. you can read the text of this news from & ktts.
In & Conversation;, the IRC program of & KDE;, you can set up various kinds of messages. for example, you can notify you when in an IRC channel a message appears when your nickname is found. with & ktts, you can then read the IRC message text.
Supports a & KDE; -program KNotify, appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program. the potential settings for KNotify differ according to application.
Filter for the integration process provide a good way in & ktts; untrue, or incorrect to correct messages, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b out of the messages sent Kmail, and also the expression / local / Inbox, since that in most cases can be assumed as required. read also.
Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not necessary.
In filters, text is edited, before he is sent to the speech speech-dispatcher. they are useful for the improvement of pronunciation to replace incorrectly spoken words or abbreviations, or to avoid any shortcomings of language synthesizers and their voices.
In order to understand the operation of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; different types of texts.
The issue of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it is drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the copy of the screen reader is read, orders will continue again.
Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will continue after the issue of warning.
News have the next second priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you & eg; you welcome any long text on a website, you can access the room. & KDE; -Notifications are also news. read it.
The rest are simple text orders. every order you purchase orders from the card ticket is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that are text-applications. text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no particular urgency.
All four commissioned types are processed in queues, except the issue of screen readers. if an application sends an issue of screen Readers, while & ktts; just one such reading, this output is stopped and finished.
First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction. they are used on regular warnings, messages and text orders as well as & KDE; -News.
Filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.
Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can still be further kinds of filters.
Text boxes replace parts of a text by other text. they can select either as a word or as a regular expressions. & ktts; the creation of chat-screeds are delivered, which allow the creation of chat screwing as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.
& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into another format. included in & ktts; are some XSLT files to translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.
With speakers of text, you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text on & ktts. if you have set a female voice on the card reader, you can read text from KDE-messages above.
Each of these various filters has set the rules following which it is applied to a language edition. if the filter indicates that his rules don't apply, it will remain unchanged from the next filter.
If a text contract, a message, warning or an & KDE; -notification on & ktts; it will be edited by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. the processing is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom.
This shows the list of the furnished standard filter. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be deleted from top to bottom.
Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filters, and you will see the further introductory dialogues below.
To set up a list of words or regular expressions, you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparative patterns. if these patterns are exchanged in the text, the text will be exchanged against the associated replacement text. large and small notes will not be considered.
Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name, it must only differ from the names of the other filters.
This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed in the displayed order from above downwards.
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.
With these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file, save the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries will be attached to the existing list.
If a language is registered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages. click on the button to view a list of the languages. you can also press several languages if you press the mouse click the & Ctrl; button pressed.
If a value is listed here, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can set several programs separately by comma. example: conversation, kmail
The application ID current programs will receive you with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers must leave you. if for example & qdbus; the applicator ID copete-3432 must be set, you can only copy.
The filter distribution filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Diane filter apply if match. are all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all texts.
In comparison of words, the symbolising filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. The words must be limited to separator (spaces) on both sides.
In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & KDE; Editor & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; regular expressions can be found in the package.
& XML; transformer translating & XML; with the help of XSLT files from a format into another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for conversions. but it can only be used on well-formulated XML. the program xsltproc must be installed on your system.
Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also enough.
With the Speaker system, you can send texts to a certain speaker, which is set up on the card speaker, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can designate that texts from kmail should be read by a female voice. see.
Before & ktts; a text to the filter gives it a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics, which is selected the text on & ktts; and the features that can be selected on the map presentation, with the Speaker system, you can overwrite the chosen speaker.
If a value is listed here, the filter is applied, if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of the & KDE; Editor & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular button, you can call this with one click on the button to receive help with the input.
To get a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with <! [CDATA [^]] >.
Here the features of the desired speaker conditions are fixed. if the text is the above-shown filter conditions, the speaker is selected, which corresponds to the desired requirements. click on the right button to show the dialog box selection.
Use these buttons to save, or delete or delete all settings.
The Speaker system is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box of Diane filters when apply. you must apply at least one condition.
The language edition API, by & KDE;, can be able to give the programmer to their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD via & DBus;.
The KTTSD module API, added with the language synthesizer to KTTSD, so that & ktts can use this synthesizer.
The following section contains a short description of the & KDE; -Bus; -Interface of the language edition API from & KDE; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the KDE; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).
Applications demand speech output via the & DBus; -Interface of & KDE; from program kttsd about the object KSpeech.
It is text of the text to read and option an language code as & eg; en, de & etc;
There are more commands that you can use. for a list of all commands you enter
Open two & console; window. start only kttsd in a window, then ktmgr in the other.
None of the mentioned language synthesizer supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?
I have set the & HTML; -XML; -UmformerFilter set up, but when using module for the festival websites do not be read.
Caused by a bug in Festival 1.95 beta you must install the (male British) voice Rab _ diphone so that Sable does not work at all. you must then make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found through the environment variable PATH.
Certain signs or interactions seem to cause errors to cause synthesizer, so that all movements may be skipped or only chewy catfish. what can I do against it?
First, make sure that the character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may possibly be solved by a character set filter. see.

The language synthesizers, which are used by & ktts, have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the concerned web pages. there are also voices that own a license.
If you have access to the KDE source code, you can download the package with & ktts; here. & ktts; you can find the source code by using ftp under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / KDE /.
Contains many languages, a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http: / / etc. sourceforge.net / long-es.html.
American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French, Canadian French, Kiswahili, Zulu and Ibiza.
KTTS is also working with any language synthesizer which can be launched on the command line in one & console.
The list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, please draw the description of synthesizer to the supported languages. look at the website of ktts;, according to information that are not included in this manual.
The program "speech-dispatcher" uses an customizable module architecture for language synthesizer. if you want to expand & ktts; if you want to use any synthesizers, use the developer team.
The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filters is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc.
To compile & compile; you need to compile a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including the package cdelibs and the developer files for the program "speech dispatcher."
If you refer to the source texts by & ktts, from the source code for kde. or have downloaded the tarball at the moment, please install and install the program with the following commands:
Before you use & ktts; please check first if speech-dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizers. in addition, you can use the Shellskript SPD-conf.
& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; that uses the program speech-dispatcher. the program kttmsgr should be so enhanced that the device of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer needed.
A long text is broken into individual sentences. the user can go back or cancel, repeat, or abort the output.
If an application text on & ktts, it can request for example a female English speaker, for example, if you want to set up a speaker, whose language English and whose sex is female, otherwise it will automatically choose the best appropriate speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts; you see a speaker, you'll see in.
If you click Add on the map narrator, click to edit an speaker into the list, or click Edit, the card speaker displays will be shown here. for example, you will find the module's device for Interactive performance. details on modules can be found below.
Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path has been included in PATH you will only need to enter the festival.
Select the character encoding for text which is handed over to the festival. in terms of voices, the & ktts, this setting is automatically made. generally, western languages ISO 8859-1 will be used to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak languages, ISO 8859-2.
With these shockers, adjust volume, microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you don't choose a few controllers and you can not be displayed this grey matter, the voice will not allow you to choose these settings.
Some votes like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark the checkbox, these voices will already be synthesized with the start of KTTSD, so (for larger storage consumption) the first set is synthesized.
If the checkbox can not be selected, you have no speaker (or forgot to click on application). see.
If the checkbox is marked, the program window manager is shown at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start only the symbol of the system is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the system section to display the program window.
If this Ancheckbox is marked and ktmgr doesn't run, it appears in the system area, once KTTSD is reading a text. this way, you have the possibility to read or to control the reading.
Here are all orders in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the task, the number of propositions and the precisely revised sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker.
With the buttons in this series you can choose a two-seat in the order which is selected in the list below, front or go back. (but not every order consists of several sets).
With a click on OK all changes of the settings (also on the other card cards) and kttsmgr is used to the symbol in the system section. click on this icon to display the program window again.
If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the audio card audio. see also here.
Here only text orders are listed and managed. issues of screen readern, warnings and messages are not displayed. more information about the news types of & ktts; please find in.
Select the kind of audio output. if one component can't be selected, & ktts; either without support for the corresponding audio module, or & ktts; can not load the necessary libraries.
If Gstreamer or aKode is used for the audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you need to install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.
Put the talk speed here. 50cc;% corresponds to about half and 200.00;% about the double standard speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program SOX will be installed.
Click on application to adopt the new settings for running the current & ktts; system.
The list of ALSA devices include all PCM units and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you need to find out what works with you. in doubt choose standard.
On this card card you can set specific actions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language entries:
The issue of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it is drawn up all other orders. after the issue of the screen Reader was pre-read, orders received back again.
Warnings have the next story priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning once again.
News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just looking for a long text on a web site, you can welcome you with & kmouth; nevertheless somebody welcome you to enter the space.
Will a text contract replaced by a message, warning, or copy of a screen Readers, adds, & ktts; the audio output into the queue.
This audio file will always be played if a normal text job is interrupted. if both introductory sounds are active as well as introductory message, the introductory sounds will be played before the introductory message.
The settings on this card ticket will only apply for normal text orders. for news, warnings, and the issues of Screen Readern there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority.
To read & ktts; read notify messages, start kttsmgr and click on notifications. the map notifications appears.
Mark this checkbox to turn the read of & KDE; disable this setting, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; reads no notifications before.
If this adjustment is marked, notifications of which a sound is played, of & ktts; not read.
Use these buttons to add events to the list, or delete it. if you click on the button add, a dialog appears in which you can add the application and the event you want to add to the list.
This event reads the message before, the & conversation, when someone is mentioned in an IRC message your nickname.
All events, otherwise stated in the list, are ignored by & ktts; ignored.
Use this box field to determine what & ktts; do if an event happens. you have the following selection possibilities:
If you select custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholder:
You can enter here the properties of the desired device. standard chooses the speaker from that on the list on the map narrator speaker as the top entry. see also.
Note that there are three levels for events. if there is a specific event for events. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the specific application. otherwise, the action for all other events of the specific application will be executed. as last possibility, the action to carry on the standard (all other events) has been specified.
The event All notifications for the application standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can specify the notifications of notifications as follows:
Use the button stores to store the settings for the notifications to a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to begin with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except All Disabilities are deleted.
The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a speech output. this standard contains brands for the control of voices, the voice speed, the volume, the sex's voice, and pitch. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.
Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:
You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, which is used with the SSML output.
If the settings for speed or sound position at the festival configuration dialog cannot be posted on 1007;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.

There are two types of filters - normal filters and satzmarginalization filters (SDB filter). SBDs underdivide text into individual sentences, not the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text contract. so you can also stop or stop or break down, even if the language synthesizer does not support this directly.
Here you see the propositional modification filter. at the first start of & ktts, it is automatically set up as a propositional sign filter. you can change its settings or add more propositivity filters, but it will be scrutinized.
At the easiest you can learn the setup of speaking selection. switch the speaker selection again, change the speaker selection and check out some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changing. you must, of course, have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.
& ktts; then, faster with the reading can begin, since only the first proposition will be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,
If the language synthesizers can not be supported on the card card, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.
For these reasons the normal Satzboundless filter will be established automatically when you start at tsmgr for the first time. it can't be switched off, but don't change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.
To obtain a propositional modification filter, text with a regular expression of proposition and paste a table mark (decimal number 8) to the propositional limits (tabulator sign are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard statutory allowance filter keeps the sign.
SBD Filter will never be applied on & KDE; -News (cf.), warnings, messages, or the issue of screen reproduction.
If you don't have to remove the normal array-proof filter, you can insert this again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.
On the card interface, you can overwrite the application settings for application. the card card is displayed if
Use of the standard speakers (the upper one on the map speaker). in other words, no speaker characteristics are specified.
Use of the most suitable speaker, which has any features of a furnished speaking speaker. if you don't delete or edit the speaker's settings; otherwise chooses & ktts; otherwise chooses & ktts; the speaker from which the outset has been selected.
Select the method for typing the requested speaker characteristics by clicking on a select buttons.
Select the properties of the desired speaking speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, enter nothing.
Mark this check box, if the property has priority from other features. you can also set several markings here.
Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output, it will always be used as a priority feature. the only case if you may want to specify the attribute language, is before, if you know that a certain application text is posted in a different language as the result of the working environment.
To use all properties in the field narrator, which is at the most likely to delete, click on the selection button, and then use on speaker, which corresponds to the following.
In this case, 0 stands for the latest text contract in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is input 0 required).
Kttsmgr crashes immediately if it is started. I compile Debug support but I don't get any traceability.
GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; got out there. probably you'll have to register GStreamer. when the problem is not solved, maybe a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.
The audio output of ALSA is not working when I start playing music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text job, freezes & ktts; a message that says: marto open PCM.
On your system, the problem is that conflicts in ALSA will prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. references for possible solutions can be found on the site of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.
I downloaded an additional voice to the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival but kttsmgr does not show this voice.
Add in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals the new voice. as guidance, please send a patch together with the & URL; that you have found the voice to the developers.
On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. so this works, the program SOX installs and above the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like festival Interactive provide a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.
The settings for the radio speed will be ignored when & ktts; & HTML; beforehand. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -to-SSML-formerfilter, and put the talk speed up.
I don't make it that websites with a female voice have been read. I have created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reading the websites with a male voice.
At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so this festival doesn't produce mistakes, the xsl file throws into converting SSML to Sbut the GENDER tags. likewise, the same applies to VOICE tags.
I have added a self-creation filter and now I can go into & ktts; no longer be a second or back. on the box, orders will be displayed, the order will be set before only one sentence. what am I doing wrong?
The character marks (point, question mark, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. use for this sign instead of a filter to set up.
ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)
GStreamer in the version 0.8.7 or later. note: verify that the modules for GStreamer are registered by calling the GST register before using GStreamer; (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)
Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music and start a text. & ktts; freezes also if you will start a text job and then start another. possible solutions for this problem please find on the site of ALSA (dmix).
As of July 2005, aKode does not support real breaks. if you stop a text job in & ktts, the current sentence will be read yet.
The SOX audio program is used for the general setting of listening speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install SOX using the apt-get install SOX. the program is on most & Linux; CDs are already included.
Have you downloaded & ktts; as tarball (with tar-packed archive), sign up as normal users and unzip the tarball into a matching folder. change in this folder and enter the following commands:
In & KDE; 4 is the module & arts; probably removed or at least only done on request.
The following modules for voice synthesizers are made by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution). the configure parameters in the configure parameter is showing the configure parameters.
As default, & ktts; in / opt / KDE3 installed, this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you have to specify as option --prefix = target. for example
On Debian-Systems / usr / local the correct file for programs which are translated from sources.
CD kechnokttsd > Inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install
Before you use & ktts, check first if your language synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.
Festival is one of the best free TTS Synthesizer whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages supported. for many, you can adjust volume, microphone speed and pitch with & ktts.
You need to install at least one language. help you find in the instructions that can be delivered with the festival. would you like to read websites, you must install the (male British) voice Rab _ diphone.
For these voices, you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code from festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer.
This voice uses the festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early development stage. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to use a Kyrie _ ru _ nsh _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding such as KOI8-R.
The festival is usually included in the & Linux; -distributions. look at the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution.
If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding must be set to ISO 8859-2.
If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding must be set to a 8-bit Kyrillic such as KOI8-R.
Festival can be used together with the & mbrola; synthesizers. then it takes over the lexicental analysis and & mbrola; this creates the audio output. the & mbrola; -program and the & mbrola; -voices can be downloaded from
Note that & mbrola; no complete language training system. & mbrola; generated language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphone. festival produced by & mbrola; required Diphone. txt2pho can also produce German text Diphone. more information can be found below.
In this case, additional wrapper code is added to the festival to use & mbrola; -voices on language synthesis; note that the & mbrola; voice files are not installed in & mbrola; file folders, but in the folder / lib /. instructions can be found under
IMS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German & mbrola; votes. required is either Festival Version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install Festival and & mbrola; then download MS German Festival of
Instructions can be found in the file README in the package you have downloaded. (for use with Festival 2.0 is not necessary to recompile the error corrections, you must restart only festival). then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / siteinit.scm.
"" "(voice location" "" "T _ de1 _ os" "" "/ usr / local / mbrola / de2" "" "German Female, IMS Festival de2" "" "/ usr / local / mbrola / de3" "" "/ usr / local / mbrola / de3" "" "German Female, IMS Festival de3" "" ")" ""
On some systems you need to edit the file / etc / festival.scm. replace only the lines for your installed German voices. replace the right path in / usr / local / mbrola /. at the time of creating this manual work the German de4, de5, or de6 voices not work with IMS German Festival.
This method uses special code to give the language about the festival using a Czech & mbrola; worries and install first at the festival and & mbrola; and make sure you both work. then download Festival Czech

This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, one module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the administration of network interfaces, routine and DNS settings.
The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by K Menu kcontrolcenter.
The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to enable the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf file to provide users a simple surface for the following tasks:
After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter is displayed. the network settings (networkconf;) module can be installed by local control system; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu; restarted.
It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have already to be operational and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and enables the setting of network properties.
In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on install by & Linux; installed and installed. network devices later added, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:
The network settings will be charged if the interface settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. when using module network settings, this system tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.
If the platform can't be recognized, the tame selection is offered. it is the platform to select the distribution and release date. by marking the setting non-again questions can be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be default automatically.
Changing the network settings can only be displayed in system management mode. before, all options can be viewed, changing mode is not possible. in the system management mode, you will be able to enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.
In system management mode, the module's functionality is available. this is divided into three riders:
The rider network interfaces is used to manage the network appliances. all available network devices are displayed. from the Horseman Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:
Setting the current network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up... in the dialog device to set up.
By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Extended settings displays the dialogue with further possibilities.
In automatic mode the TCP / IP Settings is taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP information is required at any system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.
The selection of Manually can be performed without DHCP or BOOTP. in an input field IP address you need to specify the required TCP / IP address. in an input field, network mask is fixed.
If this adjustment is checked, the system initializes the network interface at the boat. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.
The values given in this dialogue are displayed as features of the device in the device list.
It should be ensured that the IP address will not be used on the network. entry of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. you can notice if the address is already being used in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.
Network appliances can be activated or switched on if required. switch on an off network device is done by selecting from the list and click on the interface....
Network appliances can be activated or switched on if needed. disable a activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click on interface....
Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet which allows the physical connection to remote networks and will be used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnetworks.
If there is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is located.
A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain extension thanks to the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.einedomain.org lists, DNA triggers this name to an IP address like about 123,43,678.90.
The calculator on the namespace solution part of the riding name solution enables a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and execution or herding in the list with the buttons or hereunder in priority.
By clicking the button add... from the host to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Nameserver link.
First you must type the IP address of DNS server, and then click the button add. the entry will then be inserted into the list.
From the calculator to the name resolution, choose a record and then click the Edit button.... It will be displayed in the processor edit.
The list of namics known calculator describes computer-to-IP address references to the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily in the boat if no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks can replace the DNS server.
Normally, the list of namics include some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. however, this version of IP will still be replaced in the future version 4.
Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... The New Add dialog is displayed.
Enter the name of the well known host and click the button add. if the known host has several alias file names, de button add several times and input the further alias file.
Select an entry of a well-known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog box is displayed.
It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK, the list of static hosts is updated.
The settings for the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.
The website of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, you can download the latest version of the source code.
For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE and Qt are installed.
The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's simply download the rpm package and install in a console; with rpm as follows:
Alternatively, a tool with a graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool can be used.
For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient for this case, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other applications are needed.
This will only be experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.
In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology are given, in the second all are discussed by & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files.
This section can not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information is communicated via the integration of PCs into a small (home) network.
Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. it is expected that in the near future, this description is focused on the widespread IPv4.
One of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is to refer to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator, or if available, DHCP can be used. definitely, the IP address can not be easily selected!
When placing a small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved field to avoid IP address follicte with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, so their any application is possible.
Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gateways.
For smaller networks usually addresses are used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.
In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all computers are in the same subnet.
Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.00, .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard-Route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own host). the default route is required for IP-forwarding.
The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.
In this part, the configuration files located by & knetworkconf; are affected and where they are placed in different distributions.
This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is any other content in the case of active DSL connections.
For & SuSE; it is known that this file is random by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another state can be seen as expected.
All the others that have been forgotten, here - you know who they are you @ foo.tld

& kcron; is an application where you can run other programs after a schedule in the background. it is a graphical interface for the & UNIX; -system program cron.
At the start of & kcron; you see a list already playable tasks and corresponding environment variables. if you use & kcron; as root, this appears both for all users of the system and system internal tasks. each folder can be applied and can be folded.
With a deactivated task, program name and parameter is not displayed and under description appears disabled.
The current environment variables are setting up the existing environment variables for all the tasks but power. when deactivated variable appears as a description.
To create a new task, first select the tasks button. then go to edit new.... Alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder... select or select Ctrl; N.
Enter the name of the program. you can select either a relative or an absolute scouts. if you want to find the program first, press release....
Select the minute (s), to which the task is to be executed. with & kcron; you can specify the minutes in five steps.
If you specify both Mondays Day (e) as well as weekday (e), the task will be executed both with a suitable date as well as on a suitable weekday. if you are executed between 1st and 15th and Sunday, the program will be executed independently of the weekday, and on every Sunday the months, no matter what date they fall.
As with the creation of new tasks, changes will then be active when the crontab was stored.
To cut out a task, select the first task. go to edit. go to edit.
Alternatively, you can click the right button to click the task and select button, or press Ctrl; X.
To copy a task, first select the copying task first. go to edit copying.
Alternatively, you can click on the task and select copying files, or press Ctrl; C.
To insert a task must first be cut or copied to the clipboard. first then, insertion is available at all. select the tasks -folder. go to edit insert.
Alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks -folder and select insert, or press Ctrl; V.
To make changes to a task, choose first one. go to the menu Edit corrected....
Alternatively, you can click on the task to click on the task and select Change, or press Ctrl; O. It will then be able to process the task of editing, in which you can edit the chosen task.
To delete a task, select the extinguishing task. go to the menu Edit.
To activate a task or disable, select it, and specify the condition with the menu Edit activation. inactive tasks are marked with inactive in their description.
Alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and select. verify that program name, parameters and description can be displayed correctly.
To run a task immediately, select this out and then go to edit now.
To create a new environment variable, first select the variables folder. go to the menu Edit New....
Alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button to click the variables and select New... or press Ctrl; N.
Specify the names of the variables. you can also select one of the list of the most frequently used environment variables; click on the arrow next to the box for the variable name. these are:
To send emails from the rest of the program to another than the normal address
As with the creation of new variables, changes will be made only when the crontab was stored.
To cut a variable, select the first variable. go to edit variable. then go to edit.
To copy an environment variable, first select the variable variable. go to edit copying.
Alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button to select and select copying, or press Ctrl; C.
To add a environment variable, first must be cut or copied to the clipboard. only then the option insert is available at all. select the variables folder. go to edit the variables.
To change one variable, first select the editing variable. then go to edit changes. alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select Change Ctrl; O .It appears then the dialog variable, in which, as described above, can edit the variable.
To delete a environment variable, first select the variable. go to edit deletion.
To activate a environment variable or deactify, select it and specify the condition with the menu Edit activation. if enabled, the variable appears below.
Alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and select. verify that name and value of the variables are shown correctly.
If all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed, you need to save the crontab. select the menu item Save.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl; S. changes or supplements to tasks or variables are then active.
It appears the standard KDE; -print dialog. if you select valves, you can see that there are two additional & kcron; -specific options in the print dialog.
Print the crontab of all users on the system. this option is only accessible to users who possess expanded permissions.
Cron, for example vixie-cron. & kcron; uses the crontab to change the user schedules from the user.
A POSIX conformes & UNIX; for example, glibc. & kcron; uses standard commands of & UNIX; to experience time and date.
& dat; is a fuse program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar to quick, selective unpack. the second purpose was the answer of a question that asked my wife: how much longer takes it when you secure?
Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:
& kdat; push the band back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. realize & kdat; the pioneer on the band does not, you will be asked if the tape is supposed to be formatted.
Realize & kdat; the previous index, searches for the appropriate index on your record. can't be found, you will be asked if the index is to be reproduced.
If everything went smoothly, the symbol for tape drives to indicate that the band was inbound. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the band can now be searched for the tape for the tape.
Before replacing the tape, first the binding has to be solved. there are three methods to do this:
& kdat; returns to the band through a change of symbol for the band that the integration is solved in the band and shows a corresponding message. the band can now be cast out without any danger.
Before a volume of & kdat; it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.
A band species must formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not match the formatting at & kdat; this process does not have to be formatted before using the tape of & kdat. typically, floppy disk drives are usually set a formatting of the tape advance, DAT drives, however, not.
After typing the bandname and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape gets lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically unbound and is ready to use.
Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the most secure files. this can be done in three ways:
Select a file or a file in the local file tree. it will only secure this file or the folder.
Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.
Select files in local file tree with a hemoggles. only the so selected files and / or subfolder are secured.
Right-click on the local file-tree and select menu backing...
Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup.
If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.
Mark a file or a folder in one of the files used for the drive. it is checked only the selected file or the folder.
Mark the files in one of the files for the band with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.
In one of the archives, click on one of the archives and select the menu entry.
Once the testing procedure has been started, the dialog setting appears for review. in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the working files for checking.
If you have confirmed the settings for checking, the dialog appears. this dialogue shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.
Before switching the restart, the files must be selected, the files are supposed to be selected. this can be done in two ways:
Select a file or a folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder is restored.
Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolder are recovered.
Right-click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select the menu Restoring....
Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings will appear for restoration. in this dialogue, you can check your selection again and change the work folder for the recovery.
If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears, and this dialogue shows the progress of the process, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.
Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexed file using the band content. this process removes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:
This will create a fuse profile with the just selected files and default settings. you can proceed to ensuring the following settings:
The current work folder in which the backup should be made. the list of supervised files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder.
For all file which are listed under the backup files, is that only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder that are on other file systems, you can apply separately under the backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independently of the others.
Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only files assured that since then have changed.
The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last inretmental backup.
Delete the snapshot file before the tar. this causes them to secure all files and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.
The functionality of the buttons files & gt; gt; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of the preparation of this documentation.
The settings can set up the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can pre-take the following settings:
The complete path to the device file for tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the band device.
If this adjustment is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is bound, the command will be attached to the drive. in some drives it is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.
If the option is turned on, it tries & kdat; unlock the leakage of the tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.
If the option is switched on, when loosing the integration of & kdat; automatically discard the tape. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.
If the option is turned on, it tries & kdat; the hardwarted blocksize for tape drives. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drives.
If & kdat, a band formatted, writes it a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:
(n byte) The band ID. the format of this character is host: seconds, whereby the host name is the full name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the era in which the band was formatted.
The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat.
The remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives who can manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not include incrementations.
Check the contents of a backup belt. this symbol is only active when a volume is integrated.
& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users or where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to obtain information about your system. furthermore, it enables quick access to information about problems based on their server.
& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is a simplified representation of the protocol files. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files.
In addition, it enables quick access to information about problems based on their server. & ksystemlog, therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions to be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol-files of certain programs.
In the current version 0.4.1 owns & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions include:
Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba
Many other functions are also included, and are explained in further chapters of this manual.
As you can see in the following screenshot, & power systems log; functions available, with their help to filter the single protocol lines of a protocol file to filter and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.
After the start tries to open the system protocol, the system protocol does not display, and it will not be displayed instead of which a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog. the protocol file will normally be found in the file / var / log, for normal users usually don't have any justification for reading.
You can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected criterion. the list of log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only logging lines are displayed on the filter bar. in default setting, the box line is displayed next to the filter. in default, a protocol line will only be displayed if contained in one of the columns the string search engine is included.
You can also select another entry in this section. select the string from the filter search operation, then select the column process, and carry out on the filter bar named a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol rows are sent or created by this process.
This option is enabled in default settings, and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. protocol rows of level errors will be displayed with a remarkable color as the protocol-lines of the level notice. the colour display of protocol-lines can be switched-in dialog.
If you want to show a certain process (for example in the protocol protocol or in the cron protocol), you can send the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, if you want to investigate the output of a specific command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you use filter bar.
In addition, you can activate the option on new lines in the context menu of the main event to display all the new line-up lines.
& ksystemlog; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the entries in the menu window, select a protocol from the menu.
& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.ora. Dort you will find more recent information about the source of sources of & ksystemlog;.
& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archives
Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv;. this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.
The V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control the program starts at the launch of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.
I will not go further to historical aspects (for example, because I know nothing about it: -).
The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on System V Init, without creating a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed there, if there was one.
The SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:
Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to launch the system or change to another run-level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things such as setserial, that will only be started once. such calls are to rc.local.
Rc.local should be on one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not a lot of use. you can also want a rc.c. / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.
The kernel is looking for various places after the program init and starts the first he finds.
The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:
At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it then you can fix / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you'll be able to restart the system and execute the following:
But how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:
You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.
How do and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line like this:
This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called by the argument.
Some people wish to set up a simple way of creating machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server-run-level run, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; also, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.
Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user-friendly as possible.
The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is simple to say not trivial: simply pull one entry from the area of availables to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop to stop).
You can also postpone scripts between Runlevy or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this happens only then if they withdraw a entry from the subject of availability of the availables.
Note: entries are postponed if you can only drag them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu and add to the target range -- even then, if the same entry has already exists in the target range.
The sortiary number of details may sometimes be computed. in such a case you must edit the type of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service.
Note: there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the Recycle Bin. be careful.
You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (Available System services, Runlevel 1 stop, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.
To shift one entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).
To manually change the registration number or the name of a entry, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the dialog button to accept the changes button, to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.
Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.
All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv; re-manufactured changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.
I have experimented with the standard Runlevelling, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?
Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).
I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for version under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.
If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.
The way as system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard for the proprietary influencing programs of these distributions, but unfortunately is no standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an expansion of the program for this approach.
If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong.
The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about Runlevel so that this manual may be added.
This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.
To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;
After you have made any changes, you need to save this. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or entry-saving menu in the menu.
& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and user list. to edit your user or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the user and group properties.
Some carton cards are only shown if you have extended extended system settings. only if you are activated alerts (Quota) for users, one card card is generated, if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD boxes.
The password administration card appears if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD boxes.
