<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for every feature, you can specify if enough space is available or if the surface is available to display or whether the surface is displayed by restrictions at the sign of the Treemap. in addition, you can define the relative position of labelling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For actors for Treemaps, the rule should be kept proportionately on the size of the entry. at the treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be kept. in order to display the entries of entries, and these frames will be no longer available, which is less space for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As issuing the area of an entry to the subordinated entries, the implementation is left up. here, it is necessary for the signage and to avoid space losses due to always beneficial areas that are possible as square. the best methods of this are lines, columns or recursive.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal surface area for entry over the menu entry. instead, a Rautal pattern is drawn into the size of the overordered details, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.</seg>

<seg id="149">I couldn't claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't want to know how many photos you have. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will definitely want to save & digitised;. the approach the metadata is guaranteed to store very fast searching and secure archiving for you with other programs, platforms, and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you have something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos should be able to store them on your reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you need to change it sometime on a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you are enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then you can then publish a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack of data easier. split new files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a securing strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the entry page of the metadata in & digitised; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written in the file. if you forgot this, then you can also save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want what if you want to change? this represents a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now begins the real work, as you should now choose each photo keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all pictures that will need the same attribute. you start the best with the evaluation or the leaderboard. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos on the more work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now continue with keyword, key words, as you are frequently hot in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogised pictures from another source with embedded keyword, then & digitized; automatically add the tree to the right place. changing the Hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done through the move of a subtree to another. the changed words are taken from & digitidy; updated as it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics show how different metadata is exaggerated. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar dates from all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to accusations or comments, the third important tool to catalyze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to just let anyone not only see your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details to see people who place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos is the title perhaps more important than the picture itself. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help you to help Him to help him about the motive that she moves you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a labeling to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitifications, you can save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as a labels. if you export your pictures into web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the labels and / or the title of web-gallery. so, you have to tell the story for the opening act no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not Earth not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of the geolocalization are already incomprehensible. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually open your journey through pictures with geographic data. this shows the pictures also to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; export to the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digitipassed; when information is deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, for example, to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can not be changed. this field does not support compmas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonymous with author): associated with the author. this field includes the photographers name. examples of this field includes titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment on the car field, it must be filled in this field.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for suppliers): use the Anbideterfeld to identify anyone who offers the photograph. if the photographer is working for an news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the Group / Agency will be offering the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they don't have any protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in work with computer, this, in the picture embedded metadata, erase or change. the solution for the majority of your photographs are just of low interest. for professionals and Halb professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitipassed; there will be such a module available in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, record loss, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, recaster balance, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are those that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, we are about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data manufacturing company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs to combat these cautious needs and you may not take you longer than a few years. of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archivquality. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you think the store is in your measurable game room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording, and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but they write a lot more reliable. so it turns to the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control unit to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protective material they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a favourable program named IsoBuster, which apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs. but it's still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device to high quality media in a non-propriated format. read the media with a description, date & author marks and afterwards in a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discourse keep your statistics for itself. its manufacturing facility include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives to this topic: discourse study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks stop the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature controllers, the most common errors case, SMART can't determine this error. some of the SMART fixed error occurs immediately. these are particularly readers and refractionaries. the expected life-time amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you secured the files, but these losses are usually able to restore any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of energy, this can cause severe damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage, hard drive age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against rapids is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest comes. it is usually available in form of a plug-bar. but remember that not every plug-in bar also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects against lightning strikes and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage halves that also provide a phone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cables of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore you also contain the protection for your modem. this is ideal for on the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller fluctuations in power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a ruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection before overvoltage, these devices can automatically save your data to save and shutdown the system. some models allow them to continue to work until the power run. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements, such as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifespan of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your host system is exposed and compare its safety when avoiding these. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about how well your computer is protected. at the end you should always remember all cables before you drive in the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software. Google shared storage is a further popular offer you can save on data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable for a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com make online storage services to have access to photos. their free memory is available to you. the professional version is not available to you, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory that should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol, and in the great firms it is included in the offer a fuse and a distribution of memory. thus, they are desaster.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the hosts. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safe.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you don't tell you when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have been destroyed in your computer. no one seems to have thought that in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably safer data transfer than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are another source of broadcasts, since they generate interruptions within data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by broadcasting problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle labels on a low level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms using the zfs and is also available for Linux; but it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. at notebooks, the share of theft can be 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them. it leads to a lower damage than such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has already been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem arises, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology develops, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is the optimum temperature for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB HDD today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone responsible for any data loss. thus, you make sure your data is often subject to a plan and test these backup before making any more dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a flash, you're lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. don't forget pilot disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desaster has always a non-local store. bring up your fuses up, into the neighbouring house, your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already mentioned above is a common cause for a loss of data despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a moment recording without histories and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of files that have been changed since last complete backup. this creates a complete moment of time at two time points: the complete recovery and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Secure backup: a backup of files that have been changed since last backup. this creates several moments. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes to a versioning system, next with the exception, which is not fasted and not continually running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be able to set up your machine. unlike script-controlled ftp meetings or other types of file transferring scripts, rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this happens when compress and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore them again. at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment intake for at least one month and a moment intake for every month. any further thinners should be done manually after you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original store, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unforeseeable because of your nature, you must be careful and re-evaluate while the time is passing. unfortunately, there is no other way to keep a certain quilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if so, if you have an old system, it's important to read and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. it actually means to increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with the area and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this section and relocate the new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't append them.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBLE; # works with ext3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resistant / dev / sadc1 # change the size of rice if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read, then you can create this yourself. this task will be easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which appears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been replaced as an open source standard for GIF-bit, and it can be much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. the downside is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and have a slow compression. this format will recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a format format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression saline (defending). however, it manages to store images in this format. a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw file format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and to use the use of metadata. a handy camera manufacturer DNG is already available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to enroll their data into a file itself. the file information is used with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive photos from the image file, mostly in the rough format. however, it can go to problems with the image file. however, it can be updated to problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you're using DNG as container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI-communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissistic efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from camera, card readers or scanner. so long the images are on camera editing, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile handling, you can use external programs again. if you are editing the pictures again with & digitifications, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under any circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. simply export them in wegaleries, encode in MPEG, please use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitidy. in section adding a photos to an album, you can find a description how you can already have photos on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album bench.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect these with the machine, turn the camera to the display mode, and turn them on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fermentor indicator will appear at the bottom. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about every entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file features and the photoinformation to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that with some digital cameras don't have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Rider Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. the picture is the same as in the metadata sidebar out of the main window of & digitization; or the image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from your camera to a single album in & digitised;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos required by selecting the default users of & KDE. once you select the photos, you can download the button download and then download the chosen button. the button chosen is out as long as you have chosen several photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera support this, is an option available for download. these pictures were now not published by & digitization; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures are available with a star in advance window. if you choose this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the buttons, select a dialog with which you can select the target album, select the list of existing albums, displayed in section My Albums, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digitipassed; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all on once, using the button Delete All delete. if you want to delete only some, then you must first select it and delete the chosen chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera again. you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted in a & digitidy; -album downloaded, before you delete it from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera image, you should make it much faster than that.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photographs often not particularly meaningful names. this can be used to double the file names, if you can download photos of different recording spots to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for dates. if you use this last option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options while transferring three further options that will be performed before the photos stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information is copied to the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded photos.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% -% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date and time to add. for further adjustments you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">When you use the option camera filenames, you have the option to download the filenames in lowercase. or if you prefer it, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, den & digitipassed; for a photo, is displayed below the name, which will display the camera in preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitipassed; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the recording session. not all cameras use this information. in section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information you embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is switched on, and when your camera does not deliver these information, & when your camera switches off, use the button Advanced. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is information about the date, where the photo was made, it can use & digitises; this substrate is based on the image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras display this information. in section page sidebar meta-data you can check that information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced. use the Advanced Extended Enclosure options at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their host to your camera is to download. select upload. file extension dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digitipassed; you, where the pictures will be uploaded. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant, which can be displayed in length and latitude. data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the european Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses an airplane to carp an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a browser to another & digitiff; if you want to submit a postcard to another & digitiff; users want to localize the location, or simply select this aspect, it is good to add the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data be supported in the image? first you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card referral. the question is at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, about a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and last of the manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera to integrate a GPS unit. but there is a couple who work with GPS receiver. either as a ticket module or through transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, however, this data must be stored in the GPX format, since this is the only format that is supported by the module's geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, who can extract and correlate the data of images and from GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script which works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs are used to be used by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitipassed; trying to give you so much control over his working processes as possible. there are many adjustments containing the behavior of & digitifications. in order to modify this settings, you need to set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action select can be advertised on single-lined preview or edit image editing. therefore, you put the default behavior of & digitipassed; firm, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This site contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data will automatically be selected in the relevant IPTC data fields, if the option is synchronised when downloading the camera database, this data is written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authoring is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this field should be the photographer as described photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is an additional description to the car field, this must be also filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">The editor is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author, if this is a photo agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here, then the Group or agency should be available here, then the Group or agency will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the relevant IPTC-Felder. this is achieved that the metadata is permanently present in the picture and not only in the database of digitization;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitization; imported will be imported without being lost.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the lighthouse of & digitization; can be set on this page to default values. every time you can't open the luminous mode. however, the option & quot; In all the image size ladenquot; should you only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get the better visibility.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color you can use this here. you can switch the toolbar here if you can use the imaging tool in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors can be specified here. in the image processing this can be switched and switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">The Chroma sub sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the following statement.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG tooling setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a low-loss algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value onto a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compress you can switch to TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it has no influence on image quality as the defect algorithm is lossfree.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you have the loss of loss of loss, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata was still not supported, but was found in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digitipassed; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs. currently, it develops rapidly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the attitudes of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal to more sensitive to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, this is a bit soft, eliminates this problem with minimal loss of details. this option records the image a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the bald balance is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use solid coloured balance, photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. by using the second sensors, the effect that exposed photos can get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your pictures are burned down, because of the inability of your camera displays the Spitzlichter in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shlichens.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw try therefore to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still non-saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you will get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and / should be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you'll probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be made later in the image options of the & digitightness. this can be too small in order to keep the time for the demo procedure, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo process algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data sensor that have many cameras and that have a Matrix coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbrella.</seg>
<seg id="310">& nbsp; and Dcraw made three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates colour artefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue ofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be performed during the rough drive.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digitidy; information such as color information by one color space in the other are to be translated as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior If a picture is opened in image editing / color management module with rough files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile file Put here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digitipassed; check out the folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The design features is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera producer and model that you use. not all profiles are built on the same species. currently there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain any color mapping or gammacorical correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not mean for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you need to carry out the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, which you can emulate how your image will print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be correct instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's pretty obvious which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. this is therefore a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion will recognize the style for the goal: F for precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image analysis and image editing is supported. many modules support, which were written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI module, you will see a list of available modules. select which you want to use and these modules will be loaded as new entries in the main menu, and also you will find some also in the context menu of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short command for tasks that can be carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short command.</seg>

<seg id="327">At the lower end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire cameras (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage era. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt /., specify your camera on which you are attached to your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitization; you need to connect the camera to your computer, turn it into the display mode and turn off.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digitization; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera name and port manually. after having set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's Camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any designation for your camera. this will display cameras of the master's main menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the trashboard, you can set the talk of & digitites; when deleting a photos in an album, you will find further details in the deletion of a photos and deletion of an album.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitised; so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules are set up in the section of the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filenary, extension factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, no one functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button stores from the tool bar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo, once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should install a copy of your image before you change it. you can do it with file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by re-establish or the button The button to restore the imaging in the tool bar. you then lose any change that you have been carried out on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting editing and reproduced by selecting the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should select the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and adjust Ctrl; -switch-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; via the setback or restore button in the toolbar a moment more press, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions between themselves are reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the photo editing, you can easily move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can put in the photo and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel, or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full mode indicates the photograph in fullscreen mode. they come into the normal view, where you can use the Esc button. if you don't want this, you can call this in the dialog box of & digitifications. you can call this out of the box office. see the section for setting up the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print the image in the menu, and receive the Standard & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the Main Menu, you can print single pictures or entire propositions. you can only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album. if you follow the wizard, you will only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitipassed; main window is on the right edge, the important information and promotions to the selected pictures. the same side bar is available without the navigation lights, even in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Tracks on the same rider lets the sidebar appear and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the inscription view, you can enter or paste the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters, and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are being cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are transformed. if you want to use the IPTC restrictions in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comments, you can either use the button Application or switch to the next picture, the inscription will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also check the metadata into files. however, this is always performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review rating is an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorsions. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate more images simultaneously, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword-tree and a select box with the previously published in this & digitilt; -session belated keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample-tree is adjusted dynamically to the given search phrase. you can restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this capacity is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering sample code at a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set in the tree by check the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar option is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, keyword and search results. if additionally one or more keyword filter is used from the right side, only the quantity of these two displayed. all selected keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and dismantle them. suppose you have selected several images in the main view. if the keyword has already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place on the selection. then a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on No keywords, which is selected in the amount to three images. they were drawn up with Ctrl + a and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. you can also be disabled using settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this with double click on the text and control panel.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which in the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the checkbox at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free storage place is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mostly adapted to & digitised; adapted to concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorless workflow is that of your camera or scanner, you can achieve a predictable variance of the indeed photographed or single-called colours. with a coloured Workflow, you can achieve that the colors will be printed on your camera or scanner, or the colors that you can print or web pages from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it must press for the results that he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you will provide enough background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with lower information enabling you to make your own informal decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image will meet all six criteria listed below, you don't need to take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on one monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB-color space. (further information please see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other editions are e-mail or Web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should I use another color space and have to make thoughts about colour spooles?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours that we can see the hugh-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the RGB space space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in sRGB color space or not, you need to install your monitor, since sRGB works out the circle. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you have to use either your monitor on the sRGB-standard coallibriers, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try to try further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, identical, equal and contrast, expand automatic correction from the menu, try to make the best of your colours the best. they will experiment with these effects, to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalizing: this method is scaled through the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color fogging. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Likewise: this method is adjusted by the illuminants of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity is as flat as it is possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contradiction of the image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes either wonders at a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast, and luminance of the RGB values of a picture by the postpone of the lowest and highest values in the biggest area and a new jiusement of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitipassed; is a semi-automatic tool to carry the Weißabyss of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly limited to a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original image, areas with overexposed can occur. if you can carry the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will be better for correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white embalm of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start the menu entry colours white balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The pre-window display can be adapted in size. on the left hand, both the original image and the preview of the tool can be adjusted. if you want to see the original whitish menu again, it's enough to click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos features a red marker. the luminance of Pixels below this markers is indicated as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up is a histogram indicating that you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most of them have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve the shadow information of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat will use the above mentioned checks, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image to use the color to calculate the colour temperature of the white pattern. on this type, the temperature and green values will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. this will display the combined score in white balance. this will appear in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store do exactly this. each setting of the white comparison you can set in a text file and download later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences set all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings can be made another photograph as your original. if you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can set the depth of the body. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more record, calculable time, and is also available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw photographs. it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the helmets. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can be given to the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color audio correction. this tool provides an integrated approach to adjust several color channels simultaneously, so that you can always make these settings the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the tonic correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tool color effects provides you four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar power, also called Sabatier, an effect of the image was created. the colored, dark areas protected the sensitive photopapier of the additional light. this was the effect that the brighter areas were inverted. the result was a part of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is possible. another increase creates a negative image that is not produced on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is (1) and the revised intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; Effect. it differs from a saturation that it has a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for a daylight optimized color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very satisfied colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those worn to light landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlights. in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the colour contrast and luminance of photos. you can experiment with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo at bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: this is the tool for brightness / saturation, a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing. if you like this result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold gradation and the simple Leuchstarch / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. more specifically the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graph, three slipones can be clicked into and the postponds can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to study operation is to move the regulator and make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and the preview of the picture will be viewed. preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this box box can be set if the histogram of a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is displayed. for images a digital camera is often dominating the linear histogram of a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic organization is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark sounds, the middle one for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium sounds, often called Gammains.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image, to adjust the inputs of the shadows, medium and light tones automatically. moreover, there is a knob for an fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls used to change the output values as well as the output values can be used, for example, creating an easy picture as background to create for something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the specified values can be stored in the file system and later reloaded, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sunflowers. check the paint pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture of the histogram for red, green, blue- and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposed indicator indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue canal of a photos. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this box box allows the channel to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera. for pictures with large areas of a constant colour, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you postpone a Kurventeil, for example, the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are darker with darker output string and the corresponding picture pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">At the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value on this line, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move up and off until the value is adjusted to your flavor.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve can be created and loaded in the file system. the file format for this is the Gimp's format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipettes buttons automatically generate the curve of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun. activate the colour pipette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option oversupply Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if more than one channel overexposed pixel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white picture that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunflowers was set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The mixer of the & digitization; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color-shading of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is a further developed tool for mixing the colour range of images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel-Mixer of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left range of the window is showing you a preview of. the original can be viewed from their own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram to display you the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. if you are able to activate luminance, this is particularly convenient if you are using the option Monochrome, since the channel Mixer opens DAS tool to create great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color appears in a visible noise, which occur of color breach. colouring is not shown in the same place in color-channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if this is the case you can enhance your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The stores as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any blender settings can therefore save and then upload. the used file format is the Gimp-channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposed indicator indicator controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue canal was adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating about your abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the calculator. also with a set of movie roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film supply with a green lens filter. this looks good in all the scene and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranje: simulates a black / white film supply with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Oranfiltered.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white film supply with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic scension effects and can simulate moon fruit to day time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) rotator.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film supply with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color-correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones while adding a little cold into the shadow oils. this is very similar to the process of permanent pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitization; tool texture may apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry picture texture may be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the view of the depth and the three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text-effect is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed (1) and changed (2). parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digitization; tool frame can add a decorative frame to added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. penetrate the picture with a colored line, niepce surrounding it with a thin line and wide frame (ideal for black and white images), encircled it with a cute three-dimensional frame. ideal for a knockout effect and decorative adds a ornamental frame with pattern added.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is set in percent. the value for the width is 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the frame is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text in any single spot. this also involves several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, colour from color space and character set with its properties like you need. the bigger the picture, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every attitude you chose for your text can be changed until you push the button "OK" once the picture has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool templates, you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template that can be used in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should be able to add with maximum compression (9) to simplify the file size. if you want to add an e-mail to the & digitipassed; mailing list digitization-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to first time, you have to put your template with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder you'll have the template. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root file for the template was made, a tree view, which reflects the folder structure of the template's template. selecting a folder, the screaming panel is automatically updated.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is increased the underlying picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this button shrinks the bottom of this button. if you want to apply the mouse to the whole image, you need to reduce the image accordingly; check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone this button under the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the picture will then be adapted automatically by the size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitipassed; sets three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture of sharper. indeed, it is not a bit, it works more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunates and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokusze is probably the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. these are the smaller ones as the resolution are put together to form a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more powerful sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image, a camera has been used for internal sharpening. images in rough-size must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness already while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening press release. you can correct them with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should work with this but cautiously, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the usable technique is for sharpening the tool refus. below Refokusze you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the image a bit soft to draw. use the tool to adjust the soft sign with the menu entry. use the front page on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove seils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview will help to edit the picture. the front window shows the output of the Filters with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate good results and should be tried first. if you make the sharpest mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a how many pixels hit on each side of a edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow greater radials. they should therefore sharpen images the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image added one of the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a break from the maximum RGB-value and the difference of the difference. this way allows you to define a minimal difference between the tones of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpen and therefore beauty errors in faces, Himmler and floods are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filters. the original image is the (1) and the revised picture (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool Refokussia focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected safety filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to use a picture of & quot; refocus quot; in which it is possible to sharpening the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. it is used to use a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. Refokussic is able to use better results than impregnable. you can use it out of the menu by calling colors relocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular saw works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's fab has a very long tail, which is far from the source pixies that is far from the original quellum. the FIR Vienna Inverse is affected in most cases even very strongly from distant pixels. which causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but should pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a increase in correlation can help usefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce Artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1, but eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a very high value will continue the picture even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter caused by an unsharpened filter. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to prevent annoying artefacts, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / oderous noise.</seg>
<seg id="503">Match size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. an increase in the match size can produce good results, especially if you choose big values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's edge. note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refusal parameter, which you have set, will be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity correction on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that lots of operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading images and compress images or eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, unsharp Maskbar produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by this causing unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of nonsharpness. for the Vienna filters you can always show the outcome of the FIR Viennese Filters always at least as good as the Unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus liner.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the methods for sharpening agent in digital photographs, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is made by the sharpness of the division of the dark, to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colorimte allows a customized color for the pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings for an adjusted, you can use your tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads mainly homogeneous areas of smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should get details that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details can always be subordinated to the rigation dependence.</seg>
<seg id="520">Absorption of alpha [0,100]: a small value is smoother in all directions, while a value near to 1 is only in one direction. if you have a film grainy or CCD noise will generate a high level of wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be the best at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this puts the maximum glitter factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. thus, set the value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: there are often 1 or 2 of the algorithm. usually this is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular stepping distance [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. be sure that small angle will produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepper [0,1, 10]: integral stepper in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the maximum quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor. it doubles the duration of the duration. we therefore recommend it to permit him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store do exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last long and a high CPU load after yourself. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors done with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with a analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) and corrected the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitipassed; smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides chosen image filter to remove spots and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of single-called images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you require further information about sensation of digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial in English.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow of the advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filters per pixel and can be moved through the radius covered by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening level. this value is adjusted to the thickness of the filter to the front. if it is increased, noise points will be readjusted, if you may change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not get more and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the felt. if it is too strong, not the whole space can be removed or noise points can occur. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not influence the glass process which controls the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not influence the glass process which controls the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark areas, which typically are stronger, however, the shadow areas too.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius can appear. if it is increased, noise and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. he can remove robber and phasenjitter. he can remove robber tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading. these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for the space reduction you have set, can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected (2). the noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to sharpening the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture with the menu entry, correct and experiment with the deposit. the front window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this surgery on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photography file.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts of your images. it is very well adapted to dive into digital, original, or later digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby receives the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. text-correction is performed with another tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franníso and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is not far away, in some areas it produces some Compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are displayed in uncompressed image. this attitude shall correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store do exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last long and a high CPU load after yourself. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can be restored as a photo with equestation of smoke. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the infamous film grainy on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time textures can be read on an old color picture which was produced with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts which were created by scannerlights and photopapier. the original picture is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitization; tool hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos using a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixel are a problem especially with high quality raw materials photos, as many cameras have JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixels quot; and "quot; luminous Pixelquot; at a picture with a dark background image method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark. the tool will recognize the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image gallery.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to you to discover new hot or light pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the right dark image to the correct image. notice an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note here that the assistant pays off the last dark image and again reloads this automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview will help you correct the result. the front window shows the output of the film with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of views.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels in preview and the results of the felt. select the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: there is an average of neighbouring pixel. it is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban corners (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color picture with a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; Vignetanimal-correction is a tool to correct the vignment, i.e., underestimated corners to correct the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lens, in particular the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vigiltierenquot; (shading) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by setting the light into the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Blenode filter, which is impossible to hold the camera with hand. wide zoom lenses should use, even with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpening effects are created by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure of modern filters and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter by using a equivalent transformation in a raw material that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrection, the transformation with an Centerfilter is applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignetanimal-correction filters, and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light starch absorption at the point of the largest density. the standard density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of vignancy, reduce it by a small degree of compensate.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignetratio correction reduces the luminance of the target with these options. the regulator do provide only positive values, as you just need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine adjustment of exposure of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digitization; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetanimal correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct image in the corners and (2) the correct image has been performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree of the second degree is the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree is corrected the distant corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is more powerful than in the middle of the image. for most of the lenses, the 'corners parameter has the reverse mark of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is scaled up the image size, thereby resulting in a correction of first degree. negative values increase as positive as the image below.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated dialogue with a preview of correction. the values you are using for your image will be stored and used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or cushion-correction should be performed before all concision type or size changes. in case you perform this correction by all the first. if you want to re-cut out a picture and then make a tonne-shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection, you can correct the tons / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can cut these with the cutting tool in the menu transformers from the image processing or using the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonne-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings from front, frame and paintings, it's the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a ton-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and corrected the image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website under this URL. the filters reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film grainy and film sensitivity (ISO). check out the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared film produced on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the revised figure under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the soothills.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filter film grainy is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film gradients on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to enhance the sensitivity of the films to raise the manufacturer great silver liqueurs from the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grazing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. in case you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy views especially in your monochrome photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control of intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values need to be needed on ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-grainy on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses a copyright algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitization; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. flattening controls the glasses or, from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and it is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitization; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carboneskizers. therefore, pictures whose gradients are slowly changing, are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with them.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator elects the pin-size and the lower adjusted the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitization; Filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitization; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a grey, monumental landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering process. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion-effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glassles.</seg>
<seg id="612">Step 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1, the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art using Unsharpens effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom imsharpness: wipe out the image along the steep lines that go out from a center. this simulates a zoomous camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial imsharpness: wiped the picture through rotation of the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the sharpest of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance of distances: wiping the picture around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-sharpness: wirelates the picture through horizontal movements of pixel. this simulates the sharpest of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft draw sharpness: wiped the picture soft into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add to a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelimsharks: wipe out the picture through random shift of pixel and simulates the sharpest of a moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paint tank in the picture and realises them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this makes it natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop-size allows the size of drips to change. since the drop-size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size of small images. number of fish changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using the & digiplug; image editing a range of shelves. use the selection tool to stay the area, e.g. a face that will remain vacant. if you then start the filter shelf drops, the area will remain vacant.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentroprops Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the revised picture (2) indicates a sunset from a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirror or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformers threaten and transformers mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Foto: bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrinkers is simple. the big question is how can you get a picture bubbles and how can you find out in a picture? how can you find the missing information again? how can we find the missing information again? how can you see the missing information here? how can we see it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. select transformers change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size can change a linear interpolation method to increase the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interaction, i.e. spline interpolation to enlarge of the image. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain side ratio: when this setting is activated, the new size will keep the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons feed as and loading are used exactly. each entry for photo is saved as text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after yourself. you can break the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo inflating, by adding a small color image onto the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the result (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cut of a photo is not only a widely performed surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a photo. to cut a photo with the mouse, press the mouse button and pull up the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle then while using the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you get rid of the mouse button, the field of photos will be cut off. through this, you can change a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting edge. you can easily create the size of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create you simply with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the access button, use the knob button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or file saving under the menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the area, you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog, will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In accordance with aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of height and width-format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is cutting edge ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you can use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to choose from the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool is based on aspect ratio. if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are contained in the cut picture, and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coaster help allow help to induce you to put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elbows, harmonic triangles are a possibility to have a rectangle towards the diagonal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden centre is a dividing to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the petals of a Sunflower. it emerges in all sorts of things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and you've already used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two numbers. the resulting division is 1: 1,618 the golden centre. a composition which is usually considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquidity relief lines if you put a picture below: these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to third level, the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spirals and creates a symmetrical visual stream.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. it should give something that the eye is at the heart of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also located on the top of the golden corner. their failure points are the middle points of the golden rectangles. in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equilous triangles. diagonal to these lines can be used on a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles to break your framework a effect of professional photographers of dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you can't achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious part.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, it's easy to keep the camera straight vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image editing and tool free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the sliding angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button preferences you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on top.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the Free rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing to the two lines. after setting it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatical cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perseverance transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that were created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that were created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformer territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformer territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformer territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformer territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit mapped. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've adapted the perspective, you get unjoyous triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to bersome is to cut it into the image with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture into a direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on default, the angle will appear to zero. a preview of the target will display you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having carried out the scissors, the image becomes a bit wiped. for a single coating, this effect is usually negligible, but two chasing is doubtful and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the picture, the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate it is the image of transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitipassed; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats, therefore, depending on your system and, in some cases, from the type like this libraries compile. in most distributions, you will be able to process a large number of image formats with & digitization;</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical location provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude will be used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window, and call the menu. to guide a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a backup file with GPX file. this file contains data which were recorded at the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded a automatic correlation, which shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera age must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera area here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. lies the deviation among them, the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any jumps from one place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes may be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a locating in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and then push the button correlate to the interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next you will only use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found according to the displayed map and increase sie.Perform this again through, until you have reached an increasing accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite screen and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hanging the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums using HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums available as HTML pages and select the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which settings can be adapted to the tab. they will only select all the albums. the albums will not select hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenchschau and the text which will appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely declared itself. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed on each image. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your image files. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. it also affects the file size. all other settings are elusive.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider Vorumbnails allow you some of the settings from the album rider for the screwing images, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user as far the action is. press abort to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occur during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to show the preview of the gallery. press Schzy to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images, and perform basic operations like filming, zooming, or merge. the viewer can be used with short-performance and lengthy. it was developed for a fast picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture will be displayed in fullscreen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG loss-free module is a tool to change images without any of your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images in JPEG format, without storing the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is the file size, as no compressing of color information is taking place. for example, you can find at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI team at KDE-imaging @ kde.or. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the KDE-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import feature of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then choose the image that you want to copy the file extensions with which you want to copy the file screen, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data is copied after you're buttoned on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function is not working with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a range of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodiver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can choose a background colour for the diashau. in addition, this module is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program for burning.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG gashau. afterwards, you can launch the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">Images selected from you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change grading images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of picture output is defined by it. a low value produces very sudden, a high on the contrary, very smooth changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should make it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set by name of the MPEG-output file. if possible, keep mpg as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, you can add your wishes to the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the gashau when you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant enables several images to print on a paper together in standard images. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sense to improve or print them with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your files stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get more dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw-Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings to the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be adjusted for white periods. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same, and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and manufactures for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you want to edit your images frequently or later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start with the exit knob. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking device mode allows you to convert different pictures to once. use this mode so if you are safe, e.g. through testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have here the possibility of existing file automatically. this is helpful if this has been created in a previous attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to press all pictures in a album. it uses the program with the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, start number and timestamp of the record.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a video collection. it uses this program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image below or enlarge. there are four types of image change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be selected depending on the orientation orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size of size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printer preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print solution and size of the photo printer. the target image, including background size, edge size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the cast images previously. more pictures can drag and down to the list of sened pictures.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window with the photos of you will be shown. you can add more images with a file extensions dialog. for the last selected image will display a preview on the right page.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the image list and then add them to the list of senseling pictures.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button pictures will remove the selected pictures from the list of selected pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the images are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not send to many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is stored and always used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Choose your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photo album; you can create two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures. the one is in & photo album; integrated and the other as module is available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the integrated version is described, which you can create HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages have to be created, you must propose some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout, and goal. in the following, each field is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the superstructure and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photo album; HTML example, see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if you choose a photo album; the export file is to be seen on the reviews page. nourishing information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. for example, you can avoid that information is shown in the viewer. for example, that all images are exported. therefore, you can't use this setting to hide specific images from certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the site possibilities are clearly, which is why not made in particular.</seg>
<seg id="923">Bottom of the page you can set various resolutions on the images. this allows you to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, not download images, for example, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if he wants a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this area of production, place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each successive sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all listed for viewer. if you choose the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, can start here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files are not yet available in the final destination, you need to copy it manually. thus, the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The application options described above have all three on base folder and URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you specify in the output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are looking at a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; you can, of course, want to write an HTML page to viewing the images. if you're looking forward to check out the image information, guests on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & photo album; this work will not even be done once.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import others in your database. the image features are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it, whether the images are stored in the file, or whether in the file there is only a link to save images, that you may have all the images together and give this file so independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two times. first, the images of the URL, which are indicated in the file of .kin file, are searched for the images of URL that you have created using the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue for Export image will be described, which you export via the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialogue is whether it is to act in internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="938">When using the Manuell option to the .kim file, you will need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option, copy the .kim file, copy & photoAlbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are regular Zip files. since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it usually is not able to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the option Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send your friends images, you might want to limit the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would be very large. here you can say that each image should be 800 pixels high and broad.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file... select, will import & photo album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which file the import images are supposed to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are personating the category individuals to import file personer (if you are a Dane) while this category is asked for your database people. this is why you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported from the categories that are displayed in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can proceed to the categories of imported files with the categories of your current database. for example, you see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch images: when you see pictures, you want to view images within different picture groups & mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will run the different steps of (1) fixed the information about your images, via (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it will talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal securing tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future Starts again. if you want to read another folder in & photo album, you can start & photo album; with the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">To set up the menu entry into photo album; set up a window with which you can change the attitudes of & photoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual you will be explained the different installation possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call on site possibilities and options for the viewer. for every setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in you how to create different properties, such as persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set complete assembly groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of grouping all groups of a central glimpeds.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the application options that are available to you in the list of members. with the top selection list you can choose the category. in the left window, you can find a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album, with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. nourishing information can be found on the site of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can be described and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help page that you can call for the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with multiple applications, it may be that the modules have been tested using the demo database, before you can call them on your own photos. demo database can be found either via the command line with the command &gt; photo album demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or over the menu help. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage of when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications do not support their pictures into albums: this type of order not supported, simulates it for some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">In doing so, simulates & photoAlbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, shows all pictures that are currently showing the picture of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & photo album, the modules also need to pass a list of albums. here goes as well as photoalbums; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser indicates the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or the category, which you have set in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums, is used, for example, if you want to choose the category, so if you select persons on the view and give the module further.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog dialog, and select the modules, which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start & photo album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you can see the window as well as you can browse your image database. at the moment, you will not find any information about your pictures. in the section, we will see you on this window, but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photo album; is the opportunity to see each image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the picture has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images, either individually or for a larger number of images. if, for example, on all images Jesper is shown and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browses as you can read in section. if you want to see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by setting up persons, places and keyword. these are a very important part of & photo album; as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move inside the pictures inside the list: if you are depicted a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can see that the names are shifted downwards, finding the people faster and assigned them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to select a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting according to date below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image, you might need to edit any selected pictures and provided these pictures with notes. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located below the picture of the picture right up.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, for example with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add the menu point multiple entries once using a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. moreover San Francisco and Los Angeles in California are located.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a transgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new transition or subcategory. additionally, you can also make an entry to an existing or subcategory. attention, this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the dialog link by clicking and postpone the edges of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make a window as part of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you click on the button options..., which allows you to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame as well. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and then you can see a window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will receive an overview of viewing images from currently selected pictures, or all the pictures you don't have any filters. for example, you can configure the size of the umbnails, by simply downwards using the mouse button. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you want a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this picture viewer will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window open with an image viewer, a new display window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures from the image in the image. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Removing button or select the edit menu. now, you will see the window displayed in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the images stored on the hard disk. in the picture you'll need to record the pictures anywhere, so you can view the view from & photo album; in the picture you can view the view from & photo album; if not all the necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9, however, the preview can be viewed, so & photo album can show you the preview of this pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function takes you out and copying files from the folders. if you still don't want to avoid the insertion of the question CD until now, please download a larger hard disk to store all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, you filter the pictures so that you can see for other inaccessible and click in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also see all pictures you can see your little sister, contests and select the menu entry.</seg>

<seg id="991">It is also possible to determine a password, which needs to be unlock the pictures. to create this password, you simply select password change in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please consider that this picture protection is not very secure. for example, you can read or delete all pictures on the file index.xml, you can read the password as the unturnkey text, or delete this type of password protection. this type of password protection is not very familiar with those who are acting with & photo album; not very familiar with sight to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to watch all your pictures with & photo album; managing and write hours over hours so you want to look at some point. for this reason it has a photo album and watch video viewer. this can be seen from preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. he shows of course the picture, but additional all the information you have about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if all these options are available after a right click on the viewer you can see below.</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has a display model as a wire model. you can only specify this value relatively to the visible level of the above-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visible stage smaller or equal to the scene of the same visual stage of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and the view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it any. you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below, drag the anchor to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the connection to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view, stretching across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to classify several views over each other, drag the anchor in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views of clicking on the menu navigation on top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window rules are floating views: views that are not in the main window. to solve a view out of the anchoring, drag the anchor on the screen or click on the small one to the left top right arrow in the edge bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Compreamp bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are shy, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with window support... store. it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window system under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be correctly installed. when this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the symbol Rendering the symbol rendering in the tool bar or select the menu entry page.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render-mode correspond to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can get any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of maximum quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render (click on the toolbar) or in the menu View Render Modi... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size card size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to rendering only one small area of the image, select the section section and give the image section to rendering in input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the features that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. an exhaustive description of Render properties can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is framed with only a beam of pixels, different errors can be created. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or stuffing effects in corners and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is Aliens.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses an anti-aliasing technique to reduce the influence of these mistakes. in general, pictures are better seen with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculated and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is continuously split up and adaptive because each pixel depends on and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color value is exceeded, both pixels are calculated by the pursuit of a specific number of pixels with super sampling, then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a low-value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color value exceeds the pre-given threshold, then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, and the maximum depth is checked, and the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of space for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that is calculated by diffuse light-reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust whether the alpha-channels are to be charged by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays are not made an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -scene, select the menu entry file... and select a file from the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command-scale of & Povray;. when importing troubleshooting or warnings, a dialogue window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object-tree to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code in the text file into the Editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene is running. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the Help button, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your documentation and version. it supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example, allocates) into the path to the & Povray; libraries. if you enter files that are not in the file's file, you'll also need the path to these files here. if a file is found in various paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>

<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for viewing in the camera view and in the window-type license.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of points on the push-button in the context menu of the wire model view. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better proximity to the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set up the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail details for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature adds a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall is displayed behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, a soil is displayed below the objects. the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you turn to edge funds, non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing windowments or create new window orders. in the window orders, it is explained how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window system: shows all existing windowments. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window order to start the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-handcrafted window orders shows all existing windowments. a new arrangement can add to the button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window of window is identified by the name. the name needs to be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views on the chosen window system. new views can add to the button add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The location of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unts, you get a map image with the previous window, with card card, you do not create a window view, but not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should very popular the ultimate but easy scene, among beginners: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should notice the following warnings carefully before you make sure that you are using only one black screen. if you use a 3D program to first time, you should notice these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following preset box order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry process. so you will now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you produce. in particular, you notice that in the fourth-wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now includes a new entry with the name of camera. if you click on it, you see the content of the view layout, where the different parameters of the camera can find. in the user documentation to & Povray; please find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing at the basic settings of the camera, but you notice that the camera can change in view of the camera, with which you can change the camera in view. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired spot.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button Application or ONE BEABETASTE, change the wire model views and the object-tree immediately accordingly. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a receipt (insert endless body quantum) and the size at x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a reversal method for a solution to this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; indeed offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane than the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Application or ONE BEABETASTE. the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is also showing the level also, if at the moment only a limited space level. if you rendering the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object-tree, you will notice that you can click the entry + before the object. in this case you can see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the list of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only so you can get some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Only select the floor to hire its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something special at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog will open in which you can select what the object is supposed to be inserted. please choose the name in the object-tree. you can change the name in the self-economy (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks like now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only have a Mattes black material because you need to check settings for the pigment. therefore, you can always remember the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on quad and sphere, click on the button Application and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly set. if you rendering your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need two new attributes. then, select this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the box-color list may only be used with two colours):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object-tree every time is monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already run out, as you can already understand the basic work of & kpovmodelers; already understood. the sphere is just as easy as the floor can create:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to press ONE BEABETASTE or the button to press), so that the sphere hit over the ground, because you have moved the ground around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Rendering is now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball-surface looks like a Mattes black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material right now. as in the ground, enter the sphere of a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select replacement object and change the name for example in the pigment. click on the pigment, then dial in-color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects, if you take time, make some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or push the ONE BEABETASTE.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine-effect and reflection is already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not chosen:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler. hopefully, you've already learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracting a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel's perspective, reflecting the visual effects of light sources in the scene and, like atmospheric effects, such as fog. this is how the scene pixels for pixels is processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see no camera without any camera you see the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default dialog dialog, you can select a file before using & kpovmodeling; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replace the oldest record in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it's a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is reproduced in the last saved version. any changes since the last store are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only then select if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry is only then selected if you have using editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Store the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeling;, here you can change the appearance, the keys and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add this option to default for & kpovmodeler; commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to the setup of the tool bar. you can add and remove the toolbar option for & kpovmodeling; -commands add and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is an option to suggest rough surfaces without any diffusion on the surface and change without the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file either for a bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">One texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& Schickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browsers. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking on the & LMBs; or the Return Return can show.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any image will be displayed in your own window, or if all images are supposed to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, you simply type the first sign of filename in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the right corner. if a suitable filename is found, the file will be highlighted by pressing return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1135">If this is selected, images are open in full screen mode. if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with background color that you can set down below. preset is not full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, downloads & snap show; already the next picture in the folder, while you still choose the current picture. this reduces the delay, if you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & snap show; with the end of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & snap show; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the coloured beam to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of screen in fullscreen mode. when in window mode the window is bigger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can use & snap show; set up, that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command-line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed due to a lack of dependence. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use dialog, so the user does not run why a script is not running.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or expand it simply to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing by scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange about Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be enclosed every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow to execute external programs and commands. mostly the function exec () is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be quite simply called. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts are attributed to the default setting of the script. for this reason, scripts must be running their default entry to monitor and respond accordingly to events. of course a script can ignore the events as it does not use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save the store and loading of the setup data, each script will need to take care. if a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder, where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script may now ask & zb; with DCOP-functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume controls a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize menu: submenu and itemtitle will also be handed over to the selected files on the playlist. to add a custom menu entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop ambigscript addMenuItem (submenu itemtitle) to remove dcop ambigscript removeCustomMenuItem (submenu entry).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & ambassadors have stopped, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to work for example the saving of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main criticism must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameters -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to find Kdelibs so installed (including the programs contained, because & amarok; requires some of them to find modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assumes that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example, but Fluxbox will help to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these represent an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library. you can notice this error to the TagLib developer under buud.kde.org and append the caputte file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and recreate the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly that is why Taglib is in charge of reading the meta-info from this file system. please report this error to the TagLib developer under buud.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you're using MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for in & amarok; is a bit mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & ambassadors have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, e.g. & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib has been compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to crash when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then deactivate your machine. turn off if inactive for... in the setting of sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a common crash, and send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program data write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but this does not fix as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($argv &gt; get _ v2tag; print _ v2tag [$v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & ambassadors, only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come into music there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start window in the statistic window was converted. you will find it under Extras's statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has been changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are available for evaluation by users while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, this playlist must be shown in the playlist of the playlist and select columns. click on the new application column to determine the evaluation for a piece. you can also use the short command Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1486">Besides general & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; -program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two additional parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface of & k3b; sets functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject (). copyCd (). copyDvd ()-formatdvd (). burnCdImage (KURL url). burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd, and then a reference to the project can be obtained via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference is possible to change the project about K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b features the features of K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (Qstring name) of the createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring. )-addresh (URL): List URLs, QString Specifications (QString path, Qstring original name) and setbacks ID (Qstring path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple files and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / foo dcop / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; -read for & KDE; with it can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the machine installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and from many codiers to encode these wav files (compressed-free compression). more coders can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the machine (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as the lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, so it is very likely not to compile anything itself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format should be used? chapter Which Kodiver provides a small introduction about coders, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy of protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the protection, it is not possible to read any copy protection; not to read the mechanisms of the copy protection; simply avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copying-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting it only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily way to read a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the slender base of the user interface, which you frequently stumbles at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the internet or can work fully without a network, where everything is covered manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of commands of the master's instructions. on the page step for example, more information, as this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the registers for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB will start the CDDB file on request in the CDDB tab. (this may be locally or online), in the latter case first must be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the tab device preferences tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default. it is noted that the encoder's encoder register was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, allowing a selected file to encode, instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (like protocols, piepsen) for programming events (such as read the CD; terminates).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (such as encoder, to set the encoders). here you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, body and compression rates, and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost is a loss-free audio format needed. besides FLAC, there are also other similar to 'shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes today have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important because both coders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still available with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates) but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a machine or machine-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as Standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - initially in 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already very high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--press' extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate of approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by adolescents, portable devices and auto-stereotypes, but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insulane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want the absolutely high quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that can be entered manually or through the program automatically from the FreeDb program, available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program for the folder and file names as well as the features of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database, in which people can read / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself in the calculator. it is too aware that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberle) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added to the music company. any information can be stored in a bumblebee by a & CD; store, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to choose a checkbox (sending an address). for the use of FreeDb it can be used with another (fake) address. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used by the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator, used for use of FreeDb, is to be used to use geographically at the next purpose mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of Spiegelservern for the online invoke of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually a month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program program is used to store pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my calculator?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia will use, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see to note that the cdparanoia packet has to be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the selected WAV files, the codiers and the desired file format can be selected. on the first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression of audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codiers. more information about Kodiers are in the Chapter World Deeper.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a Kodierers you can receive further information on its switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). you must replace 'lame' by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. verify the device model name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and read on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio coders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to explain both programs with a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the CD; this will not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for Step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Do you have read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time; reading everything and our first & CD; reading 'lame' --preset extreme 'to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have a write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into the context).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the action to read a & CD; what must be repeated for any output & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the reusable code for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with you to download the FreeDb program to download the CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will be very likely not to read on any page of a CD; change when once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device model is given to the program program to read the & CD; -dates / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently it is / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device type of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a CD; / DVD drive is also available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use existing entries for the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General Settings. here you can't do much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be changed / entered as shown on the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only If incomplete information can be consulted, so that you will be informed if data are missing from keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and release the CD; data automatically via the Internet from a FreeDb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the read & CD; connected to the internet to access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second select field is easier, becomes a & CD player, starts instantly the reading of the CD player, and it will be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag records, they can easily changed with the database name - &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, you can continue to note: if you are able to set off the box and FreeDb is not used. however, you can use FreeDb locally in the offline mode, so check out the two select boxes, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving & CD; information from the FreeDb server to the internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about FreeDb. set it all as it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this route the load is distributed between the machines. however, this attitude will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as there are many firewalls the protocol 8880 standardly, there is perhaps more fortunate to surf with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel read and encode? the author don't know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it around the & CD; cast out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you are specified, the path must be stored in which the wav-files are stored. this is not useful if only space on another drive is available. do not forget this folder, if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All so set as it is on the screenshot. the command is something long, under circumstances, something must be puffed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--press' extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo audio systems. the resulting rate factor is approximately 224-256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary change of tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of encoded WAV files: at a dualcore or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as default for each interpreter & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, which is organized in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the CD; data from the FreeDb is to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any output & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not included in FreeDb, the screen photographs are a little different than those responsible for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving data from the internet. comments are shown on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' edition of the author this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD, into the drive that was defined in the main window, has to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, then search in section questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been removed successfully by the FreeDb, all tracks are already filled and additionally the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key is displayed, and you can select the database entry, in your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't select the checkbox for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually retrieve them through choice of the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have any local database, we need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - enter the CD-data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; in accordance with the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in an input field 'Update Title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidiciell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the FreeDb, the CD editor is not empty. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words are starting with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the field on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 signs for the comment field. if you are set to ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least for what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the tab tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information from the generated files anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see the help of the Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obvious to the style of the output CD; it is not important because we don't transmit the & CD; -data anyway isn't exaggerating. for more information please visit the categories of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you'll see that the fields are already filled with the checked data, which we have already recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply type the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third knob of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the checklist.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before every line of a piece. only the titles can be selected as selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece. select the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces on once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">It has been launched by clicking on the button selection process, so this window appears to confirmation. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track down what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders to switch to the order window. it's in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error message if you are trying to work with a coater that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in an example. have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece which is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and encode parallel. note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and encode. with powerful machines, the calculator with an amd64 seems no problem with simultaneous interpreting and encode (of, however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button, and drive through the knobs.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slowly, you can click on the left and right of the Tempoad and then change the speed speed. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry pause in the menu, thus interrupts the playback. mix the space bar while no pieces is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Song texts can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics, and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up which events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is checked automatically, enabling you to adjust the entry automatic text selection automatically, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event type, choose from the menu settings the entries text events or push events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which summarize you. these are part of the series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager first. find out in the menu collection under the point. click here to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then add the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the healthier in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add to the button add a song. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting automation add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatical add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and gelded. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song, then click on it.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs are played. if you select a row from the sub-menu track sequence of the menu, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, next song from the menu, press the right arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse the way back a song, select the button above, the previous piece from the menu or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, click on the button clearing.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmide; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizer which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI-events occur in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map which converts all events of the Change patch to Bright piano in the events of Change Change patch to Trumpet, thus making a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the necessary rules for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. premise for this is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "Another keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left-left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the sounds, which need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not able to take a gun (e.g. with tone 60), you can gain a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a rifle. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (winning), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, with which each note is another percussioning tool (drum, basin, maracas & etc;) and not the one that the sound height of the same drum means (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how to use sounds on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. they only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used primarily to make sounds to the percolt channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to set some channels on others. if you want to swap a few channels to others. if you want to swap out the first and second channel, you simply do it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyboard map will need to be defined in the file. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percolt patch on the percolt channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which relation Pitch-Bender event will be multiplied and then forwarded with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then the value is 4096 being used in the map file (no decimal places).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that will play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to a octave above. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmide.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a full range of piano pieces (one for every MIDI channel). you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the knob lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played tones. view from the menu settings below the point sealview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed when a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find it, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices too much different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I cannot compel anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file is needed (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also modify the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have compiled a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to remove the problem, you need to download and install the source</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole file to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">In understand, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can set the arrow key left from Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the default tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & KDE; -Desktop a & Konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only change in the & Konqueror; window to change and go to the desired file in the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to one file only once, without adding it right to a collection, turn the setting automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you want to play the first file. so, set the setup automatically to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play as B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animates me to continue using & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am writing a bit of free time for my Hobbies, but I'm trying to collect myself a bit of time. as Hobbies I'll collect program, MIDI files, making music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You can really make me a giant freaking, if you send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I'll send you into contact with friends of & kmid; but if you want a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmide; completely written in my spare time and made no harm to anyone. I would therefore stress that I just receive feedback from users (post cards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - correction of the error that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Mr. Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the network that give us these wonderful Midi- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I highly recommend you a sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it is run as if you would have a sound card, except that you can't hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of called andockable windows. there's always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear if information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred connections under the menu Bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, use the category of permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchies. if you have a record, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and the playback will start with the requested entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist may also be changed by direct Editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do if & kmplayer, can be viewed by a text file, but also on a name of a category. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this component will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, it must be selected from the menu, or select the playlist, or select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode or any other group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 obsc. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / cascplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format needs to be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starters doesn't need to be short, it will be automatically completed by opening any other source. however, this would end with the end-animation however, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the advertisements of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; IMG dur = "intr.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; / bodyboard; In the source package of & kmplayer; in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL are supported by & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here, the path can be set by the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this restart device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything has to be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here's an example of a 'flash' using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be used to embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave-flash can be specified in the alignment dialog file association of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The conqueror or & kmplayer; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module. if there are no mistakes, the backend volume is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a pre-given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if it has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can be downloaded from TV cards, either via MPlayer or Xvideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be configured, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in kmplayer is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should be detected, of which one is selected. the correct coding must be found (e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo, it should also work on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension has to be supported for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally you are used by KMPlayer for the sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation this dvdnavel, source, source, vcdsource, source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start with the playlist of playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there indications how I can quieter my CDROM drive, if I play from it (not of the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root as user, and it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why must my CPU be tested on their performance?</seg>

<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and forbearing settings. 2. the document can be written on the basis of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the font is determined. the font has not been established at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; -source code is compiled. the easiest way to use is the use of the building or button quick-growing.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compile. & kile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compile of the document failed, it should be searched for errors in the protocol. if using quick-construction & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, also the logging should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that will be different from the other document. for example, a report with the font size is 12, and only a couple of water is to have a different font. the command\\ 'can {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end} environment} is encouraged to provide the development of the font within the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Examples will only be saved within the environment (of\\\ 'environment} to\\ end {environment}). there are no restrictions (number) for people within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many opportunities to listen to the reading and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, subcutters, etc., will end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ 'Start {emph}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is closed for long as long as he will be closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ '{Quote} and ends with\\' {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; -drawing language is shown, then a step-by-step-guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard, a bit text should be entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. for this reason, mind. a quotation, a few places in the fat and curiosities and a poem to the application occur to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a stable file format (engl. D e V ice I nap). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi edition like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screen windbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file can be printed on the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - according to the click on DVI, then print the document using a file (in the viewer) you can print properly (if the printer is properly adjusted).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar illustrates the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion into a different formats can begin in the toolbar into the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For the downward search, the direct jump from the editor for added position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. you just need to set up a Modern under Settings... tools Bauen.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the precursor, the mouse indicator has to be positioned in one line of the source code and clicked on preliminary search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then checked.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & kile; it needs to set & kile; in & eyepiece; as text editor (setting eyepiece set up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-construction of the & DVI; viewers do not need to suggest an error. if a bug is required, this will appear in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file is the source of the source code in the source code. in the editor, the protocols can always be used in errors. in order to view the defective line, the log file must be clicked on the error in the log function, navigating immediately to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the corresponding button in the tool bar, a window appears to choose from the template for the document. pre-set menus are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a complete document, a document can be used either by reason or the assistant to fast creating a new document. for more information on this section are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Personal users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or create a new file. & kile; can create a new presentation by using an existing document and selecting a file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a presentation by file New will set some strings through other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables must set up in attitudes (e.g. name or character).</seg>
<seg id="1803">To create your own presentation, it is therefore necessary to know which string chains are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is used through the input in document class. typically, they are used as "\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and that is used to use the commands in the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, it can then be exposed to its own presentation instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. will be a simple way to create a template, should be searched after one on the Internet and those under described steps are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmability of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including also latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made out of menus directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his abilities should be attracted to Kate. users from & kile; can be found there directly with the Reading of Works with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command referenced, which can be called the Mention Help LaTeX reference, and can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>

<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, the source of the source will be irradiated in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; the ability to browse the various types of source codes and these are emphasized. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas differ by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can occur in a new type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entry is highlighted in the text or final mark. in this way, this jump brand is highlighted, so that it will automatically appear in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processor is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent mixtures were added; & latex; important functions for their selection. under editing, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Set out a complete paragraph (group of lines written on both sides). this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines, and latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only perverse thing in & kile; this is that the distance is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word radiates under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also contains & latex; commands with an empty star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To listen to a part of the document, it can be removed from this first, and can be removed by drums of the key. & Kate; offers the key line here. & kile; offering their own instruction for a faster tool. under editing, the following commands are provided for the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removed a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit output paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clear that environments can play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for more commands under editing environment for a sweet simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is placed before or within the command\\ '{surroundings}, the end of the environment will jump (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many polluting environment commands, quickly the view of the view can be lost. this command will close the most significant environment, so that the fusion structure is not disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that will be determined by staples {...}. under editing TeX-group are some important commands that correspond to those of editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the preferred bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the current group will jump (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the clamp clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor is before or behind the screwed clamp of a & tex; group # is, the other end of the group jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When typing many scrapped groups parentheses can be lost quickly to the view. this command will close the most recent group, so that the merging structure of the & tex; groups do not be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two basic materials are used as gene type. for the fitting the sign is used in & kile; the sign for the beginning will be used. & kile; this is the case and for two close registration number for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry into the double enclosure can set up under Settings... LaTeX and will be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also many different languages (e.g. nought or French) and therefore German or French begining symbols. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift, ONGABETASTE is for a smart line breaks. if the current position is located within a lists of the lists (e.g. the logs or itemize), it is a line of line but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start editing the plug-in menu. this is open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialogue enables you to manage and add all the plugins contained. we describe each & GUI; -ELEMENT in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. adding plug-ins without a storage location used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on one project several people work in a form hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specifying team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the user's nickname and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team manager and sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of Team Members, who he is. this is done by looking for the team member of the list and the button Setze than presses. currently, selected member (their identities) will be fat after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by the members of the team: it can be created an event to the information to the team manager if something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are promotions that will be executed if something particular occurs in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project, as much someone has worked on it or the sending of a message when a file is secured, or a script that will be added to the CVS file, as soon as added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On page event configuration of the shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in a different manner than with file open open files (where the encoding of the file can be approached), but this setting is displayed by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this attitude will be delivered from the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies. this is not the same as saving the file to backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for even not stored documents, backup regularly is created, according to the set time.</seg>

<seg id="1970">Entering: this information will be handed to plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding file (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-reading" mode: check if the plugin refuses the store. only-read-parts usually refuse to load the store when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is activated, then testing & quantaplus; if the specified information is right, then the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was implemented, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which allows various implementations through plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with selecting a matching Debugger plug-ins in the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger Plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a Debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables will appear. normally, in the left Dock appears.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all hold points, listed with line numbers and conditions are listed in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. normally, the lower Dock appears.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything is available or part of the following functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger, if necessary, made or shared the plug-in with, on Debugans. this action is enabled by default when a project is opened, so that a debugger must not be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugal session starts the session. closes the link to the debugger or terminates the sounds of requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to a Debug requirement. this is synonymous with using a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Displays the debuggers to start with the execution of the script and to date information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line will be continued. if this happens while the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">If this happens, the debuggers are to start with the execution of the script, without informing information to supervising variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is required, the execution will start before the execution will be made as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger will execute the next command in the script without entering the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger will execute the next command in the script, with which if possible in functions and includes adjusted faults.</seg>
<seg id="1988">If the debug suggests to go over and to the next so, if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be supervised. the overeighth value appears in the variation view.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Package (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; offering support & quantaplus; skills such as car finish and kiss to make. their simplicity and flexibility is made of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s included two file types, the page file and descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handmade, symbolified bodies of image buttons (above the Editier window), which may insert text and instructions faster in a document than one user may be.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created hanging (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the descriptionrc; and also tool bar. briefly, an & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and the contents of the Featuresume; the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags in a document without any danger of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag file are nothing but folder. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag file contribute to the name of the language-language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is laid in simple ways.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only be found once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a only-element type about itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tag type is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for the meeting class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. gives the name of the class where this method belongs to. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute and attributes within that tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; Tag. this is a only element element element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describe an attribute of a tags. this element can only be specified once for each attribute. additionally, it lays the name and the type of attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that should describe as this attribute is displayed & etc; This is a only item type element.</seg>

<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology within & quantaplus; is used to submit the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and methodology names. the arguments that are passed to the method. can be empty or% day name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container that grouped together the elements of a list. it can only once occur for an attribute description. it is a only element element element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of attribute of a tags within a dialog. this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be available for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0-8? &gt; and must be tilled and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces does not affect anything, but pay attention & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; can be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML file, the tools dialogue at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check out TagXML. a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, checking only takes place at the store of the TagXML file in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this day XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, an example for a working family 2 day XML file. this file is described a & PHP; overload function. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is as quite simple and there is an editor for it, reachable via DTD edit DTD settings; for one out of a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = version 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set up with attitudes actions... to be created. click on New Action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned to the key shortcut. with clicking on the button, button1 buttons can be assigned, with Kone, the current keyboard snipple can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detector settings and inserted in the promotion of this text on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples of & quantaplus; themselves are the quickstart -dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripthum / scripts in the command line: global script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: it will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only an instance starts, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods described above can be a script input from & quantaplus; on default input. in the box field input can be determined, which is to be sent to default. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the entry, the output of the executed application can be diverted. there are two types of output: normal edition, written on the standard issue. it can be stated that the text should be done with the text written on the default edition by selecting the box.</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to provide the tags in logical groups. in this case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool added is added, you need to add actions and configure. select settings to set up actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button on the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the day to matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes, and you plan their use, enable "edit dialogue" day if available to allow entry to use when using action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igouitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kicedit, use. select from the & kmenu;, chart other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose editing size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least send a message to the user that Anols is a & lt; startled; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with setting up actions. (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there is still which gives, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement several usual & quantaplus; -functions for the tool bar, or it should adjust this to a better overview of several separators in several groups. open the toolbars setting up dialogue with toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to specify the separator (at the left top) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that should be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please notice how the Trenner support the grouping. someone, who doesn't know my toolbar, might believe that the & Conqueror; button on the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct file. after NeueXML does not exist, it will create impediordner, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct file. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal users is the opportunity to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -documentation-tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; repository, if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will give you the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top item = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = func2, tag3 = func2 = Conference 1 = tag2 = tag2 = tags.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation about something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2 documentation = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Medition.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = long-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no famous limit for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents of contents can be referenced directly onto a file (and consequently, the upper end of the tree vision & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything but pay attention & & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of docrc file, which is intended to display the context of context of context and pressures of Ctrl _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate text elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc / $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (such as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there).</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and it's worth shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separator resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu entry, as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool comparative tool bar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all others & quantaplus; users can download them and only available if our team needs them as correct and usfully for the publication. to use a useful contribution to what it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources are guaranteed, both for our team and later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can find one out. in the new resource needs to be fulfilled (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK has to be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload, upload, upload, toolbar, and files in templates and scripts in the context menu of the menu DTD DTD Package (DTEP).</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not yet produced by & quantaplus; the creation can be more time consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in XML format. it gives the easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convergence of a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string that will appear in the DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / E http / / / www.w3.org / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">The DTEP after conversion: if activated, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first introduce these concepts with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits brownish.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolbars about actions, everything is marked as globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this allows the group of administrators to secure promotions and patterns in the global tree that will be available to everyone in an multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything written in a specific project. it can be said that this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder, which means the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the EditorWindows, the building project, the box with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">To view a context menu with the right mouse button, in order to obtain a context menu with the current document, like close to the current, other or all cartons, recharge, deleting or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS command to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorfield lead to another context menu regarding the revised document configuration (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse pointing device or opening the file, if the string is named under the mouse pointing file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor, the editor's tool is present. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as default, for which a proposition of toolbars are shown. in the course of further expansion of toolbars, the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thereby connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to insert into this document, then click the symbol that represents the day. now, you can insert the data for this straight day. if you want to insert the data for this straight day (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction purposes (QIT;) allow to navigate into the information & quantaplus; navigate to open and push through. in the representation of boxes, project, sample templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of constructions are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mousec. actions such as adding, removal, upload or delete files from storage medium can be performed with the following context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are available.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are usable in the project. more about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts in the Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send with e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-Click, the cursor position is set to the position of the element. by the right-Click of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other intentions. with it can change manoeuvise attributes and namespaces. this allows changing the content of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to web-technology for your development. you can download the documentation of the quantaplus; 'document center can create their own documentation, and adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartons at the bottom of the window can be reached on the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box shows information about each in Quanta running script. thus, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box shows all errors in the check up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the coolbox of the tool bar is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail;. if they get a tool bar in an email, they can assure them in & quantaplus; like any other secure and loading!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, Autoconf has a number of options that can be given to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the KDE; 3 bin file. also, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before her bin file. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible brand-up languages would be? well, this would make him the absolutely big web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized, if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim, & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the complete & KDE; developer base is based. thanks to the & KDE; -affold not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web development using an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. by using the program compression, they may need & quantaplus; it can be found without any scripts in scripting language. (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a fully-equipped editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way linked with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developer left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is to help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / quanta execute).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not located, whereby the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the later use. check in section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project keepers, only a bug is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to insert from the clipboard there is a special sign to & HTML; -censhrase, so that they appear correctly and cannot be understood by the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -notes, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & shift; button to select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages get out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the news window. that's the window where you see the display of scripting and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exclusion and enrollment of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; the head of the problem is activated once you switch to the structure-tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries or next date, depending on the position of cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other unopened documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project of the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a subfolder and add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Reload the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods will depend on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project administrates. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects please explain the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites one project tool bar. these are kept in the project / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set up using settings. toolbars are stored in the toolbar of the toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the visibility. it does not delete it from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send their own tool bar (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the tool bar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / unloading of the dutities from the & DTEP; it is sensible when the dutities from the & DTEP; to renew the whole & DTEP; if this global one is not present and a write permission in the global KDE file is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the current loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu Standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or activating the intelligent insertion tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus is refusing, if this day is refuted on this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins listed below are listed below. click on. click on a activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syndication mode for the current file. the list of available pre-emphasis is based on that; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate change between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is also the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes an entry for each open lower window. with a selection of a contract the corresponding window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Shuts the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; primary coat.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue affects any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directing the behavior of the Editorfenster. in the documentation of & Kate; you find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, where you can delete entries from the toolbars, or which can add or modify sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create an assistance in the context of the mouse pointing, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; -development in financial form, you will find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed by the top of the project, as after the fill of the project name, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later. all of these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file will be filled out automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces using the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine which you want to access one, except one processed local data. either a name (hostname.Ex.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log files are used. depending on the setting of the remote computer, an adaptation can be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a joint collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and standard toolbars. if a joint collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change. if you want to change your scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defaults, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound. if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can suggest an exact selection of credits.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. one can select the desired files by Anhaken or, by removing the hamlets, clause from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be instantly upload or changed in the menu with Project Properties in the Settings Window, or with the Tasty Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to above, even files that are listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be charged when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">You can choose the desired debugger. currently only Gubed can be supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the button options. in this case, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the lower window profile, upload profiles (see in) can also be discontinued, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile, by poke a own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the lower window configuration, project members may be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details in details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the underwindow event configuration, one can turn the event actions, change or erase these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a certain event occurs, like the sickle of a file. see details in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the Project's Project will be displayed and allows to choose a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervision provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be administrated in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Stewards behave as well, however, the entries are opening and open up with the right-up menu (press-up menu):</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is canceled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and forgotten in programist. this possibility is useful if common uploading of files is necessary and the more unsafe password to the record store option does not occur in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog, if you change your mind from the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; you can create many high charging profiles and uploaded the project (or parts of the project) to various servers. using editing or profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name, to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function, or a danger. use it after your discretion. password will be stored on the disk, so that it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded into a project many views, i.e. by simply numb the view can be loaded several files and toolbars, and replace the currently open files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted by the project toolbar, reachable via attitudes of toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this does not only boost its productivity, but also enables the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own workings.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bar in & quantaplus; best referred to above the menu tool bar. use and add differ. adding tool bar is treated below in the section of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set up either by using context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, can set up other actions such as tool bar, tool bar code or tool bar, which may be specified in the dialogue, which may be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, in addition to the entries, remove and action labelled are shown that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the promotions of them can set up in the menu with attitudes of toolbars... and setting up the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essence documentation, code escalopes and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates like a common filesystem with extended organisation and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any at the system existing directory in the stock area. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you are preparing for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have any conditions for their deployment. please read the conditions required at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file besides text, such images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted into documents using links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the stock market under global templates. more information on the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. it is usually a simple report for the purpose and organises work in a proper way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the stock room under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final note to Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the stock room under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as template's template's template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project status) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project area below project facilities.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file Report as template-save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn up with pulling and dismantle the designs.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file only can copy only into a precursor. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and dismantle or inserting over the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder or in the Project File Baumanhood to a folder on the right and secure site template to enter a name for the template and secure. by default, it is saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project suggestions enable a very target-oriented manner. you can adjust headline and footer and connect dynamically with & PHP; shape, insert files or link with them. additionally, one can keep some things with using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the underwindow pad is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / template. each of this folder meets one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded when elteristic attributes are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default, and to activate everything except for the ancestor in the template. if a regular folder would turn off, it would appear to appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a pediordner.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows earlier or printed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headline or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of contents into a folder with special Headlines / footer to equip an entire presentation with the right header / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) about a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste the templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second, the editing window will divide into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL file.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it invites one document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and return as required for the source code editor, where the source code is displayed in the VPL file.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandensor of & PHP; it is not possible to edit these directly with the VPL file editor. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes in the source code as well as in the VPL; editor synchronously works. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the key pressure is reset to the active cursor from a window to others, while the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; -View you can automatically select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be set in addition. in general, the recommendation is for fast calculator and a large range of slow computer for slow computer.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags is possible with the VPL; -editor is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL file. this can be used to change the condition:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. key words for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added up or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows changing the Inhaltes, e.g. keywords on the column name and key word keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in your browser. it can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible just as with the meta-elements. the edit of CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing the file button, and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is as in a word processor, by moving with arrows, possible. among rare circumstances the cursor will behave like usual. the marking can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted through rectipping and the back button or distance paste will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way above the toolbars as in the source text editor. it is noted that the insertion of tags should not be removed before existing identical tags, i.e. an anchor tag, surrounded with text, every other surrounding anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some of the toolbars like the tables and the lists assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work in this release should be used the tables or lists of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of style facilities. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style device can be persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile it, except & KDE; still need libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are available at a typical installation of & KDE; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, at a place in one of xsldbg loaded back or xml file or at the current nodes. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, spoilt points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path from a filename without scouts. filename in the same folder as the top-loaded style file name to a relativner con xsldbg is for example a style file system. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following entry is possible:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time had corrected the influence on many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed in this lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the insertion had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be seen in a row and changes to white characters. later, any amount of additional useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare it quickly, easily copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons consist of each other in a piece of code and changes changes. the merging editor under the differences between conflicts and shows simultaneously the result of the expected outcome. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot is showing three quell files at merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps with the comparing and merge complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences, and also refer to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently use Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side of the left. (no more trouble if someone changes the deposit.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When one file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify your work by simply write the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder 1 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The open-dialog enables manual type of filenames, select the selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last updated file from the list. you don't have to specify the third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button file... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparing or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, however, use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merge is crossed, the input field is active for the target and process itself. however, it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before you start merge with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. compared to open dialog you don't have to select files you can easily close the dialogue with the button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drag it: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar are these functions, it would have only two corresponding files to copy them into & kdiff3; download and then compare these relevant sections. you can then simply copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: there is currently nothing from & kdiff3; pull out. only the flaw of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copy and insert). in such a case, your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info-line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse display a while on the line.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources of sources are the letters A, B and C. a color blue, B is the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed through the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one can see on the colour which file differs. if both files distinguish themselves, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is very useful if you compare three files. that is well visible in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individuals relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of text, is interrupted at the places where the source file is activated, when the line file is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The earnings window (below the comparison list) also has a info-line with the inscription output:, the filename and [it changes] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next deleted / unusually conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative Americans are used, each difference has to be resolved at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the first line of the group will appear in all windows and the first line of the group will appear at the beginning of the group.) This group will be highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background colour for current area and the left will appear on the left.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merging or manual processor remains no more line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the quelop; displayed. this text is not displayed in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; costumers; however, appear in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources, ignore the options, or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are dealt with as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image running and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard right, right, bottom, down, page on, side down, at the end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the oversizing column can also be used through the vertical image bar.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insert button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section) and the editing window (explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg insert), whatever you mark is automatically copied and the manual copying happens. be careful with this option however, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are stored according to the existing operating system. UNIX-variants use a line-feed characters\, and Win32-based systems use the line-saving of the source files\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-saving of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will automatically be stored and restored to the next start. (menu entry - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a writing with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width, you should not use this.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When activating this option, differences are shown in italic script. if the selected scripture does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colours might not be available in pure form but would be rendered rendered. on these systems the button preferences will automatically create an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the pressing button will be inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, an tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you enter or press Return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, any selection will be copied automatically into clipboard. the manual copying into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files tries & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines will be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can't be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. even when merging will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car backfeed '\' at the end of one line, but then you could save files with different sizes on page-to-side comparison, but then files are treated with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison, however, as a white sign will be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated. changes in comments will be handled as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-jump mode, this attitude will determine how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next level of the conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if the automatic selection also need to be less important in numbers or comments, if the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore these or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapters to scanning the folders and through a merge. look for details under documentation to the directory and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be the Suffix .original appended. if already such a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of user interface. the Change of this option is not currently running the current program. you need to finish & kdiff3; end and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE-version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activates this option, the upper adjustment is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for encoding appears a short note, what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file code for source files. this influences such as special characters, and interpreted as special characters. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, can be compared and collaborated with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding should be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could handle 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).) With this option you can define the coding of the output of preprocessing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress pre-curtain of changes in white characters in text or testimonials. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options ignore these or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded survival column. but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files. after choosing A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal one second transfer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply remove the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window by side or each other. this may also be useful to display long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts to compare the merge file as a default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the file name, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be delivered to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is precisely your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut off-out parts or to correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be given to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is specified. the output of the command is only used in line. you can write your own preprocessor, which matches exactly your requirements. each entry-line must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users want to program this too. however, the good news is, however, sed in most cases or perl complete.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command to convert the input in capital letters: SED'S /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'character sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add character strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all following the same pattern is required: SED's /\\ $\\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with experimentation, you may be able to understand it and perhaps you may have these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further preprocessing command to be inserted. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several targets on once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate parts from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use some other details e.g. perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' However, perl need some details differently at perl. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the earlier '\\'. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and assembling. the further operations only change the data that can see the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like-processor is the output of the normal pre-processor processor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text changes or differences, you may not notice certain differences, and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can the merge simulate and shows the simulated changes without it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... will execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge of single files. you only have to open files on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three files are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no target file is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as a target file.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merge. to restart, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will notify you a small news window about the current progress. if you break the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to the date.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder, while the scan is found, is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded, by clicking on the + / - click, or click on the object, or by clicking the arrows keys to the left / right. the menu menu contains two functions of all subdirectories, and open all subdirectories, with which you can open all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file system is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case the merge clock action can not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about the problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture you can see in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Files are considered identical, if its overall content is identical. then you also have the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colours of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow is and later, when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>

<seg id="2391">If you choose a target file, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target file, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped through certain entries. check out these options to avoid unloving surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all entries together, select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keynote). to merge only the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid data types still exist, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options executed, simulate, and abort.</seg>

<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you'll notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and execute it again later. even if here the merging might be skipped or not stored, these entries will be changed again. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern will be displayed in the Elementum. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid places: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the elementary-tree. it can be entered in more than one pattern, use semicolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the elementary-tree. it can be entered in more than one pattern, use semicolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that will also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be specified with a .cvsignore file. (check under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a notch attribute. in other file systems, a file system marks a file as hidden. this option allows you to decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary-tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Where links to files: when the option is switched, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, files are compared to which the links are displayed. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared with default. if the option is switched on, the links will be handled as normal files and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3) will not be checked on possible recursions. a link to a file that will lead to itself and take off.) This option is switched off on default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Does a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns. (the number dissolved, unpowder, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be easier to compare the change date and file size. please use caution. please use caution. this option is off on default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical. that can be useful when copying the expiration date. please use caution. this option is off on default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode, if two files are compared and no target file is specified. in this mode, the proposals will be identical, and the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In case there are differences, instead of merging copying the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe, because it is provided that the other file has not changed too.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. if an old backup file is deleted with the .original extension already exists, this will also affect the normal combination of single files, not just the merge file. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge view is visible in combination of single files; you can turn the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can turn the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file via double-click menu. however, in the directory menu, you can also use a single file directly. as soon as you save the result, the status is set to be done and the file will not run once you restart the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, if you read the directory again: directory menu: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders there, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archiv with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. some things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished if a link is shown on a file or folder. then always a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change of change. therefore, deviations or change of change from the original. (note: this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main configuration is currently regarded as differences reflection in KDevelop. KDevelop begins to start the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually you need & kdiff3; two complete input files; if it is used as a part, takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files in the Unified format. then degenerates & kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch has to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, it is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small factory and menu. the merge or the comparing of folders will not be supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heist es) is already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it may merge the program diff3 out of the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by doing other programs in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go for it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script to KDE. in the default installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be identical as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line is not identical to Each to Each other, this folis. but this folis often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers every difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. however, that's necessary to solve a conflict by clicking on the source code and select the button 1 / B / C. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file, and it is too much effort to design extra a file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too large. you can always be able to restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src left; appeared and the text is not extinguished. what does it mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; many colors are used to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people out of the wild wild. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information, how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>

<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake utilized, you shouldn't have any problems with compile. should still be difficulties, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or switching old) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or switching) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all types of folders are not in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target file.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to read the folder with the function actualization tool.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to exhibit the differences that identical files will not be copied to the target file. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing in a later program version (the behavior will likely change in a later program version).</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in earnings window (if they are not already present), so if the lines are already available, click the button according to the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underdifferences in single character (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working spaces to end its size, finish it or move it. this works both within a desktop and also with multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual workspaces, as well as the applications that applications can be selected, and can even be moved on Desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends where the right mouse button is based on the empty background of & Kpager; but if it is clicked on an application within & Kpager; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimizing, maximize, Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of desktop. appears only if it has been clicked on an application.</seg>

<seg id="2456">If the checkbox is marked, windows can be moved inside the & Kpager; the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas are postponed.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the & Kpager is displayed; the name of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Anchor this field leaves the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual workspaces. it is together with name, the names are provided with ordained figures, & eg; 1st floor.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this box is crossed, the running programs will appear as a small window in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces are displayed to allow the selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply showing simple rectangles with the proportions of the program windows. icon displays the window with their standard symbol and pixel. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main compartment can be specified: classic leaves & kpager; in some other windows are known; horizontally, all virtual workspaces are located in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical line, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniature in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display window as symbols or with its content. in addition, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">To set the right mouse button inside & Kpager; and set up the exit switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can not be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded by new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & kmag, a window appears as above. the main window of the screen. in the following, this window appears as a magnification window. the picture that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged area of screen and is described as a select window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting increases & kmag; the area around the mouse indicator as an eventful lue. alternatively, you can use & kmag; to set a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection mode) or the setting of the mouse pointing at the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointing out in the enlarged window, select the mouse option. please note that the mouse configuration is still able to recognize the form of the mouse pointing. this is always the standard KDE; / Qt; -mouse pointing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In drop-mode mode, you can change the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrows and moustaight and change its size. this can be done in the following manner:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointing out in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can shift the contents of the magnification and move. this also goes with the arrows keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you are using the Shift & Shift; button or the & MMB; use the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the drop-down window. note that the top-left corner of the radio station remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kiss; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, in a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), turn the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the updating of the display. the stops of updating causes the required CPU time to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the actualization rate (Very low, low, medium, high, Very high). the higher the actualization rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kiss; automatically uses your set-set short command to save files, open a new window, printing, newcomers (with the button document loading up in & Konqueror;), enlargement and clutors & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">May also be known as & kissing fier; it is a screen menu. you can use & kplacfier; to use a range of screen, as if you would use a magnifier to look at the small printed in a newspaper or a photo. this application is used for various people from benefit: from researcheur or artists to the web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse pointing out for a while at the same point. it's meant to help people suffer from the RSI syndrome (repetitive strain syndrome) and which each mouse click is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse pointing out for a while at the same point. it's meant to help people who emulate the repetitive strain of Injury (RSI) syndrome, and those every mouseclick can emulate pain. however, this requires a bit of exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle pain using the mouse button, and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may suffer pain that are related to the use of your computer, you should look for a doctor if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To avoid it again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid the clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain, which is used through the moving of the mouse, and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can fall differently for each.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart processor is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break, after leaving the mouse button, wait until the end of the motion. in this way, you can run the pulling in pressed mouse button. the smart shifting requires a bit exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This refusal must be musty after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is switched on, the shooting field is switched (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after the suppress of the mouse button, before the mouse button is waiting again, if there is no reference to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; supports the click through mouse shift. is this function activated by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back is saved if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shortened the reaction time. go to Sound & Multimedia, choose the sound system and here the tab General. there is a sliding-buffer sound buffer that you can set on a lower level to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this adjustment is checked, & kmousetool; at each start of & KDE, started. this function is currently only available at GNOME or other window environments, to find out the respective documentation to find out how to restart a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all the settings to the values, which were set when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button, the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressures of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with presetting. in particular, the smart processor should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & KDE; if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should make yourself aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in browser window that cannot do a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite easy. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that comes with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens is from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. dirt and soiling can easily scratch with a flat blade or finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the version of & kmousetool; if you're just going to move the smart processor, this means that & kmousetool; the surgery is no longer able to end the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you self-run a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool; back and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool to execute clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>

<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart processor, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart processor is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you handle it. it's very well possible to copy it into the clipboard or move back any other action in which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button. but there are probably some problems with them. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart processor if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. select text instead at the end of the text area a mouse click and hold the switch-button, while you move the mouse pointing to the other end of the text and re-press the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will be done every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button puts a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the smart processor without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X window; installed, which should be the case for most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers, and they are set correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited, before he is sent to the speech speech-dispatcher. they are useful for the improvement of pronunciation to replace incorrectly spoken words or abbreviations, or to avoid any shortcomings of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the operation of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; different types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it is drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the copy of the screen reader is read, orders will continue again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will continue after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next second priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you & eg; you welcome any long text on a website, you can access the room. & KDE; -Notifications are also news. read it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you purchase orders from the card ticket is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that are text-applications. text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four commissioned types are processed in queues, except the issue of screen readers. if an application sends an issue of screen Readers, while & ktts; just one such reading, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction. they are used on regular warnings, messages and text orders as well as & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there can still be further kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text boxes replace parts of a text by other text. they can select either as a word or as a regular expressions. & ktts; the creation of chat-screeds are delivered, which allow the creation of chat screwing as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into another format. included in & ktts; are some XSLT files to translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speakers of text, you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text on & ktts. if you have set a female voice on the card reader, you can read text from KDE-messages above.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has set the rules following which it is applied to a language edition. if the filter indicates that his rules don't apply, it will remain unchanged from the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text contract, a message, warning or an & KDE; -notification on & ktts; it will be edited by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. the processing is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished standard filter. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be deleted from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filters, and you will see the further introductory dialogues below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set up a list of words or regular expressions, you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions than comparative patterns. if these patterns are exchanged in the text, the text will be exchanged against the associated replacement text. large and small notes will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name, it must only differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed in the displayed order from above downwards.</seg>

<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next story priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning once again.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just looking for a long text on a web site, you can welcome you with & kmouth; nevertheless somebody welcome you to enter the space.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Will a text contract replaced by a message, warning, or copy of a screen Readers, adds, & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a speech output. this standard contains brands for the control of voices, the voice speed, the volume, the sex's voice, and pitch. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, which is used with the SSML output.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound position at the festival configuration dialog cannot be posted on 1007;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and satzmarginalization filters (SDB filter). SBDs underdivide text into individual sentences, not the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text contract. so you can also stop or stop or break down, even if the language synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional modification filter. at the first start of & ktts, it is automatically set up as a propositional sign filter. you can change its settings or add more propositivity filters, but it will be scrutinized.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest you can learn the setup of speaking selection. switch the speaker selection again, change the speaker selection and check out some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changing. you must, of course, have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then, faster with the reading can begin, since only the first proposition will be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the language synthesizers can not be supported on the card card, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal Satzboundless filter will be established automatically when you start at tsmgr for the first time. it can't be switched off, but don't change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">To obtain a propositional modification filter, text with a regular expression of proposition and paste a table mark (decimal number 8) to the propositional limits (tabulator sign are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard statutory allowance filter keeps the sign.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD Filter will never be applied on & KDE; -News (cf.), warnings, messages, or the issue of screen reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you don't have to remove the normal array-proof filter, you can insert this again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card interface, you can overwrite the application settings for application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the upper one on the map speaker). in other words, no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has any features of a furnished speaking speaker. if you don't delete or edit the speaker's settings; otherwise chooses & ktts; otherwise chooses & ktts; the speaker from which the outset has been selected.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for typing the requested speaker characteristics by clicking on a select buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaking speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box, if the property has priority from other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output, it will always be used as a priority feature. the only case if you may want to specify the attribute language, is before, if you know that a certain application text is posted in a different language as the result of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the field narrator, which is at the most likely to delete, click on the selection button, and then use on speaker, which corresponds to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the latest text contract in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is input 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately if it is started. I compile Debug support but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; got out there. probably you'll have to register GStreamer. when the problem is not solved, maybe a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA is not working when I start playing music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text job, freezes & ktts; a message that says: marto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts in ALSA will prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. references for possible solutions can be found on the site of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice to the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals the new voice. as guidance, please send a patch together with the & URL; that you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. so this works, the program SOX installs and above the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like festival Interactive provide a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the radio speed will be ignored when & ktts; & HTML; beforehand. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -to-SSML-formerfilter, and put the talk speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it that websites with a female voice have been read. I have created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reading the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so this festival doesn't produce mistakes, the xsl file throws into converting SSML to Sbut the GENDER tags. likewise, the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a self-creation filter and now I can go into & ktts; no longer be a second or back. on the box, orders will be displayed, the order will be set before only one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">The character marks (point, question mark, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. use for this sign instead of a filter to set up.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in the version 0.8.7 or later. note: verify that the modules for GStreamer are registered by calling the GST register before using GStreamer; (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music and start a text. & ktts; freezes also if you will start a text job and then start another. possible solutions for this problem please find on the site of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support real breaks. if you stop a text job in & ktts, the current sentence will be read yet.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, one module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the administration of network interfaces, routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to enable the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf file to provide users a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter is displayed. the network settings (networkconf;) module can be installed by local control system; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu; restarted.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have already to be operational and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and enables the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on install by & Linux; installed and installed. network devices later added, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings will be charged if the interface settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. when using module network settings, this system tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can't be recognized, the tame selection is offered. it is the platform to select the distribution and release date. by marking the setting non-again questions can be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be default automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings can only be displayed in system management mode. before, all options can be viewed, changing mode is not possible. in the system management mode, you will be able to enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the module's functionality is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used to manage the network appliances. all available network devices are displayed. from the Horseman Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setting the current network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up... in the dialog device to set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Extended settings displays the dialogue with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode the TCP / IP Settings is taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP information is required at any system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The selection of Manually can be performed without DHCP or BOOTP. in an input field IP address you need to specify the required TCP / IP address. in an input field, network mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this adjustment is checked, the system initializes the network interface at the boat. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialogue are displayed as features of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address will not be used on the network. entry of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. you can notice if the address is already being used in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The website of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's simply download the rpm package and install in a console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient for this case, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other applications are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology are given, in the second all are discussed by & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information is communicated via the integration of PCs into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. it is expected that in the near future, this description is focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is to refer to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator, or if available, DHCP can be used. definitely, the IP address can not be easily selected!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When placing a small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved field to avoid IP address follicte with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, so their any application is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses are used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.00, .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard-Route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own host). the default route is required for IP-forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files located by & knetworkconf; are affected and where they are placed in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is any other content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is random by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another state can be seen as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a fuse program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar to quick, selective unpack. the second purpose was the answer of a question that asked my wife: how much longer takes it when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; push the band back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. realize & kdat; the pioneer on the band does not, you will be asked if the tape is supposed to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Realize & kdat; the previous index, searches for the appropriate index on your record. can't be found, you will be asked if the index is to be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for tape drives to indicate that the band was inbound. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the band can now be searched for the tape for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before replacing the tape, first the binding has to be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; returns to the band through a change of symbol for the band that the integration is solved in the band and shows a corresponding message. the band can now be cast out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat; it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species must formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not match the formatting at & kdat; this process does not have to be formatted before using the tape of & kdat. typically, floppy disk drives are usually set a formatting of the tape advance, DAT drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After typing the bandname and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape gets lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically unbound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the most secure files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a file in the local file tree. it will only secure this file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a hemoggles. only the so selected files and / or subfolder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file-tree and select menu backing...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or a folder in one of the files used for the drive. it is checked only the selected file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files for the band with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">In one of the archives, click on one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the testing procedure has been started, the dialog setting appears for review. in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the working files for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking, the dialog appears. this dialogue shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before switching the restart, the files must be selected, the files are supposed to be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or a folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder is restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolder are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select the menu Restoring....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings will appear for restoration. in this dialogue, you can check your selection again and change the work folder for the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears, and this dialogue shows the progress of the process, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexed file using the band content. this process removes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a fuse profile with the just selected files and default settings. you can proceed to ensuring the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should be made. the list of supervised files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all file which are listed under the backup files, is that only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder that are on other file systems, you can apply separately under the backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only files assured that since then have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last inretmental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the tar. this causes them to secure all files and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; gt; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of the preparation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set up the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can pre-take the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this adjustment is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is bound, the command will be attached to the drive. in some drives it is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, it tries & kdat; unlock the leakage of the tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosing the integration of & kdat; automatically discard the tape. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, it tries & kdat; the hardwarted blocksize for tape drives. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a band formatted, writes it a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this character is host: seconds, whereby the host name is the full name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the era in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives who can manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not include incrementations.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup belt. this symbol is only active when a volume is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users or where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to obtain information about your system. furthermore, it enables quick access to information about problems based on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is a simplified representation of the protocol files. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it enables quick access to information about problems based on their server. & ksystemlog, therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions to be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol-files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 owns & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & power systems log; functions available, with their help to filter the single protocol lines of a protocol file to filter and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries to open the system protocol, the system protocol does not display, and it will not be displayed instead of which a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog. the protocol file will normally be found in the file / var / log, for normal users usually don't have any justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected criterion. the list of log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only logging lines are displayed on the filter bar. in default setting, the box line is displayed next to the filter. in default, a protocol line will only be displayed if contained in one of the columns the string search engine is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this section. select the string from the filter search operation, then select the column process, and carry out on the filter bar named a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol rows are sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings, and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. protocol rows of level errors will be displayed with a remarkable color as the protocol-lines of the level notice. the colour display of protocol-lines can be switched-in dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show a certain process (for example in the protocol protocol or in the cron protocol), you can send the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, if you want to investigate the output of a specific command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option on new lines in the context menu of the main event to display all the new line-up lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the entries in the menu window, select a protocol from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.ora. Dort you will find more recent information about the source of sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv;. this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control the program starts at the launch of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (for example, because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on System V Init, without creating a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to launch the system or change to another run-level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things such as setserial, that will only be started once. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not a lot of use. you can also want a rc.c. / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for various places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it then you can fix / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you'll be able to restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How do and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way of creating machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server-run-level run, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; also, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is simple to say not trivial: simply pull one entry from the area of availables to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also postpone scripts between Runlevy or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this happens only then if they withdraw a entry from the subject of availability of the availables.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you can only drag them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu and add to the target range -- even then, if the same entry has already exists in the target range.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sortiary number of details may sometimes be computed. in such a case you must edit the type of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the Recycle Bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (Available System services, Runlevel 1 stop, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift one entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the registration number or the name of a entry, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the dialog button to accept the changes button, to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv; re-manufactured changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevelling, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for version under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way as system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard for the proprietary influencing programs of these distributions, but unfortunately is no standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message when their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
