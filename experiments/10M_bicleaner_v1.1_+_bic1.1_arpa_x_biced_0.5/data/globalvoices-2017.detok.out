Although I had visited the USA at least once a year, I would now live for the first time.
And that was very exciting for me.
My love for America is extremely big.
As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated American music.
In fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly known because of an American film journalist.
When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless presenter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud, the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.
I was caught.
Free to Method Man, "I was it as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to do with my life."
And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US was yet reinforced.
I always said: "America is the only country where I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people.
I even had a very shy love letter about his size.
Then Donald Trump came.
Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.
The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottling.
He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.
He tells what he thinks about how a former colleague put it off, and publicly declared its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.
Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.
The 13 million votes he won by the republican election was the highest number ever reaching out of the party.
I was speechless.
Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?
I could not bring Trump and his voters in accordance with the people I met in Phoenix, during my time.
As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic programme, people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.
The Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."
Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.
Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr that her life fights for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.
She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and wormwood and my colleagues to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.
Then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me a lot of my career.
These people and they embodied by them embodied my love for America.
While Trump got his way to the nominated republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.
However, it turned out to be the exception of rule.
On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt against non-white people.
The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they shared either his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, I broke my heart.
Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as Rassists.
The people have agreed, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.
This is superficially and respectful, suggesting an inability to understand those who deal with a different way and think.
It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.
Could it be that these voters, of whom most knows, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country, which she has disappointed?
In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?
Perhaps.
However, one can hardly remember the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to find a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.
This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "rebellion against all other ethnicions," word play from white in watching the white and whiplash, which means the great Van Jones "name, has just killed what America has made such a great way.
Millions of people around the globe appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is to everyone.
For this country chose two presidents, twice the son of a Kenite, whose story itself, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.
With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.
In America, after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, they say.
At all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.
At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd.
Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your United States? "Mr. Khan asked.
The crowd answered with a loud "No!"
"could Muslims have a place in your United States?"
"no!" roared the crowd.
"do Latinos have a place in your United States?"
"no!" they answered.
Do Afro-Americans have a place in your United States? "
"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their voices were louder." ""
"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your United States?" "" "" ""
He received a unanimous and silent "NEHEIN!"
Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that America." 36 hours later he was corrected.
The land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.
This is now Trumps Land, said the message.
And all the people like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.
And this breaks my heart.

From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children do not leave their love for music by garbage?
The "Recycled Instruments," by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.

What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in Oaxaca in the province of Oaxaca, together with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura?
That the music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...
Music, who lives with the waste
Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-colony ruins and its world famous cuisine.
For several years now, La Banda de Música (music banker) has now been playing in the community: one of children and adults, existing symphony orchestra which has found their musical instruments a way to overcome the surrounding poverty.
A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.
The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:
The church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuses and the band violence.
But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope.
Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI believes:
As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.
They always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and play in the Trubel you day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.
Music made of trash
More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recyclable waste material:
Music with recompeted instruments made up of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez has begun to turn parts of the query into instruments.
The instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of trash.
The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.
In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the first time:
At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same spot the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.
This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced by trash.
Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of restored material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.
"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:
The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish every year.
Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.
And here they turn him into something beautiful.
Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational acting from trash-to-music around the world.
The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:
These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully fighting illegal fishing
Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.
This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine showing specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental issues.
The republication occurs within the context of an agreement with Global Voices to joint use of content.
In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing by illegal fishing waters before the other coast of Africa visited Africa.
In this way, East African countries were uplifting and slightly inclined to welcome a lawsuit of this kind in its coasts.
Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves rapidly against the ship. they refused to take one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permits.
"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who were just refused," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing industry. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted." ""
In 2013, the ship was driven out from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.
In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's stocks.
The core of this initiative, which protects against criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing stop).
In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are six countries who drove the Premier from their waters.
"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they share information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""
Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to increase. this is illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing in regions.
Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species should be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems may harm the delicate balance.
However, during actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, the actions occurred in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.
There, the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists of licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.
Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, using satellite data.
This enables the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as such as suspicious driving routes - such as those that hinder a ship will wipe his caught fish on the way to other ships.
Ideally, such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a fish licence, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal.
Countries that are against illegal fishing can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can't sell their cargo to their cargo, and that they could even be forced to use of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.
"" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not financially worthwhile." ""
And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant firm that is involved in the struggle against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.
A closed front
The first platform was created to win an estimated $20 million to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of the illegal fishers that penetrate East African waters.
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are also illegal fishermen.
These practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifies phasienames, fish protected species and fish in nature conservation area.
"" "" "" "they are targeted the lack of international collaboration and make the weaknesses of a no longer organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship could say illegal and a country could then say" "" "you mustn't walk to the port." ""
But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale asshole tries to close FISH-i now.
So far the closed front will work.
Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.
It has exposed criminal networks, which had distributed licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found whispering ships.
Based on his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.
"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the" "" "organised crime" "", "Bergh says." ""
He builds a system that can help FISH-i to give suspicious ships more precise.

Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly evolving, helps to raise the illegal ships to hide themselves.
"" "" "" "the illegal fishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO who also deals with fisherman data and provides FISH-i technical support." ""
Some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be addressed by satellites.
This is why the Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find discriminating ships with a larger precision.
A model program
But can FISH-i's team African nations really influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?
John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.
Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that can offer satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each traceable ship worldwide.
"" "" "" "gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that's just sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and to bundling their resources." ""
"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project running in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""
There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detective, but also shoppers.
Ships that have been fishing earlier without licenses and could hardly expect consequences, so they know that they are being watched.
According to Kiilu some of the members involved in FISH-i have now increased a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats and more licenses.
After FISH-i Somalia helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board trawl nets, whose use is forbidden.
Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.
Other countries also notice these achievements. "the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries," says Kiilu. "" in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing.
In 2015, six countries have joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. now they are fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH i. "" With safety, the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.
Recently FISH-i's youngest member country left his first major triumph in October: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and have been banned by towing nets.
The ship was also banned in prohibited water, which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.
For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative study to the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world.

The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.
They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the government of President Nicolás Maduro.
This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.

After the government rejected the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezolans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations ran over the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were assembled on the streets.
Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the withdrawal of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.
The debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-west of the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.
The political and economic situation in the country deteriorates continually, which makes the everyday use of the Venezolans through an acute lack of food and pharmaceuticals.
Many representatives of the opposition saw Nicolás Maduro as the opportunity for a fundamental change in the minister of the current President Nicolás Maduro, however, blocking a reelection of the official authorities.
Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government's context in its latest article:
As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to give the country the opportunity to reinvent its institutional structures and close a new governance.
To join the elections of the National Assembly, the campaign against President Nicolás Maduro was forced to join the National Assembly to join the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a twelve-hour strike began to join the National Assembly as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, on November 3, should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum.
The call was commented on Twitter as follows:
It is, as far as Venezuela: tomorrow's National Assembly, Friday state of civil war and on 3 November all went to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.
Continue to say! pic.twitter.com / 9zyVgldNry
@ MariaCorinaYA and @ soyfdelrincon: "tomorrow we go to the street with the National Assembly - @ NicolasMaduro."
"the reconquest of Venezuela"
"" "the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program" "" "The Return of Venezuela" "" "took place on Wednesday, 26 October." ""
The pictures of the fairytale, which are published in real time, testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen as well as advocates of the government.
One of the most often shared images shows a protesters that calls through the protections: "will you kill me because I am hungry?"
"" "" "" "will you kill me because I am hungry?" "" "the Venzolans cries out." ""
It's enough, without shit.

On Twitter, images that tell us about arguments, as well as reports of suppression and abuse.
Particularly large waves beat the message through police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.
The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral, to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed support of the government.
Hours later they could leave the cathedral again, but the protests continued.
In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andes State Táchira:
The women in Táchira do not carry coats because you could otherwise see what many nationalities don't have!
Meanwhile, an infographic on the round which forms the extent of oppression per day:
So the dictatorship has suppressed the country.
Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a loan procedure - these have now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets.
Mytek Media Labs include:
Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are fake.
Here is your official leadership!
On the road!
Others evaluate this protests as a further step in the fight against a government which has been taken out of their view little against the devastating economic crisis, making it more critical voices:
They took us so much - but also fear!
The fairytale always take part in frequency and intensity.
Some Venezolans reported the media, they were hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping.

This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, a Argentinean news page.
The interview was translated into English and is being published here with friendly permission.
When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.
In the meantime, Quijano said, in the context of the big La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba, against his father.
In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.
Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.
Starting with the brush, the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.
For 34 years he held the secret secrecy for himself.
In the situation, I thought that was fine.
I felt like a secret agent.
As a child with 15 years, you don't notice that it is manipulated by his father.
At that time, I could not know that my father was a thief, folks, and murderers.
Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was an endless military officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret service division 141 in La Perla prison.

Archival absorption.
This is not the story of Luis Quixano, the oppressors that is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and abduction of a 10-year child.
No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who witnessed the magnitude of atrocities which he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.
His story shows what great power has a parent about his child, and how this child chose a way of redemption.
From the sports hall to the military base
When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts.
All called him "Kent."
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photograph and asked me to identify my friend.
He said:
You are an asshole, you are pleased with one of the ERP.
Pass just that they don't lead you one day, and then I must save you.
The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Guard Party in Argentina.
Therefore he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.
He told me, I would be obedient.
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had raised me.
In the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.
These were all possible documents: university closures, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda amaterial, books, just everything.

'Since the prisoners are tortured...
My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.
During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.
When he participated in the second time he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barrack, in cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just all possible.
Everything was stolen.
He gave me a little wrap in a blanket, and ordered me to wear it on the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.
On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down, and kept me with a guard.
Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:
The prisoners are tortured.
I ran in, and saw a couch, tortured in man.
She looked like a fieldbed and metal-feathers.
Later I found out that they sealed it at the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just caught there.
They captivated a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured him with water and pursued it a load of 220 volts to the genitals.

The contention in it was horrible... as a dirty Windel.
Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.
I realized the smell instantly and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need.
I never forget this smell.
And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another?
'I knew that those people were killed "
When my father participated in the work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were tied with handcuffs and carried the eyes.
He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilians who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cuadra.
In the background, I saw a number of mattresses where naked people were lying down on the face - all were tied at hands and feet.
Near the entrance, people still kept silence on the mattresses.
"" "when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "" "What do you look like, asshole?" "" "" ""
"" "why have you brought me?" "" "" ""
I knew that these people were killed.
They were thrown into a pit, and were killed by soldiers.
I know this because my father told her home.
In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms that were designated as offices.
"" "I know that" "" "Palito" "" "Romero hit a man there and killed." ""
(according to information from survivors of the Civil is Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera Process, the students Raúl Mateo Molina to death).
In the following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the Memorial La Perla, leads through the former torture chambers.
The path, where you came in here, is also the way to which the unites came here.
When you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.
Here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of deferred.
When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved.
This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.
The 'war yield'
My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.
At that time, I had no idea what the "war" - how they called it - was.
But when I was even at the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war yield gains a bajonett or maybe military rabbit which one is fought against an enemy.

But if you go into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then that is no war yield but vandalism.
That is theft.
I was always asked how my father, the director of security forces, could join this vandalism.
I just don't understand that.
I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein.
I don't understand how my father could do that.
Once he called me a criminals and I answered: and you who sticky the cars on the road?
You are no criminals?
He exploded with anger, struck me, and cried,
If you go so far, then I will find you and compile you.
We don't need anyone else!
That was my father.
I have no only good memory of him.
When I said in the process, I showed a photo from that time, on which I wore a jacket and a roller pullover from wool. both had my father from La Perla.
We were not poor, but he still brought clothes to home.
At that time, the defense accused me of being a fellow-mate for this crime. I answered, no problem, they can lay down for the burden of what they wanted.
Anyway, I was there to tell.
'the disappearance of the body is the last vile act '
Now, where I'm older, I feel repentance.
I have children. if one has only children, you can recognize the value of a life.
You continue to develop and realize that it's wrong to kill.
I even went so far to say:
Well, you were exekatted during the dictatorship of people. but why should the bodies disappear?
Why do children lead us?
One day my father brought a girl with her home whose mother had been killed.
She was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.
I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?
They would have just been able to put them into prison.
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why would their bodies disappear?
Were these people not even families where they could be delivered to their mortal remains?
The disappearance of the body is the last vile act, which one can do to man.
My father told me when democracy was re-introduced, they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners.
They were crushed and somewhere there - no idea where. "you never find something," my father said.
But something remains always.
'I have seen how you killed men! '
To make it clear: I have nothing against the military.
I even was even with the gendarmerie.
I just told the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.
The idea to display my father, arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.
I made him accusations because of all the atrocities I had to experience for him.
"" "then he suddenly said," "" "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone." "" "" ""
I felt inwardly, and asked me what the entire patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended, were actually good.
Then I cried:
How can you tell me something about me?
I have seen how you killed men!
You committed terrible crimes and you forced me to participate in a child.
"" "he only replied" "" "Well, don't show me." "" "" ""
That's exactly what I did.
In 2010, I registered the first ad.
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal.
Nobody can throw me out that I am preset. I finally told my own father.
Luis Alberto Quijano died in May 2015 under house arrest at the end of the trial.
He was indicted for 416 crimes: including severe, unlawful freedom of freedom in 158 cases, torture in 154 cases, murder in 98 particularly severe cases, torture followed by following death in five cases and a case of kidnapping under 10 years of child.

The elements in the "Megacausa"
The term "Megacausa" refers to the tendering of the judgment.
After four years in which more than 581 witnesses have been heard, the historic La Perla-Ribera process ended with crimes against 716 victims between March 1975 and December 1978.
43 Sigoppressors were found guilty of crimes against humanity. the Tribunal sentenced to life sentences in 28 cases and sentenced to death sentences between 2 and 14 years. in six cases, there were free acquittals.

All the accused were members of the military, former military member, former police officers and civilian employees.
Piero De Monti was abducted with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Perla.
He addressed the following words to the silence chamber:
La Perla was a death factory designed by non-human heads.
The tribunal is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that worked for years on justice for years.
Claudio Orosz, the lawyer of the 1995 Argentine organization H.I.W.O.S., which represents the children of people, who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared, said:
The process lasted more than three years, but the research took 39 years.
In March 2007, the Argentinean government passed to La Perla, so that a memorial was erected there, which is now led by human rights organisations.

A translation error makes older people in Kyoto's "terrible driving"
The sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto, where you can extend his driving licence.
The photo was widespread in the social media.
Adapting the original photos of Joshua Levine.
In the Kyoto city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence, in the last month, a very particularly misused translation.
"" "on a sign the Japanese word (coreifensha), which means" older drivers "means" "" "means" older drivers "" "," may falsely falsely - but perhaps also translating with malicious postings "" "" # 8212 "" "." "" "
The wrong translation was on electronic ads in the entrance area and to read in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.
Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided into the social media.
The mistake was the translator of Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local loids so attentive.
The Kyoto, the Kyoto, released in Kyoto, wrote:
"how could it come to such an English translation?
This proves that no one has read the translation correction.
This is an insult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.
The flawless English translation was initially removed. the name "martial" (German: "terrific motorists") was later replaced by the appropriate, if there were also grammatically not correct (German: "older drivers").
The police in Kyoto preapologized for the translation errors. furthermore she explained that the error had already been included in the text, which they had received from translators and that the translation was not tested on their accuracy before it was published.
A blogger reported as follows:
"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people felt by insufficient correction (the translation) on our other side," "" "said the Police." ""
The Japanese online news service J-cast news set something more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorist in Japan and wrote:
The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of motorist drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents, which are nationwide in accidents, but certainly to worry.
In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1.941 of a total of 19,460 have been caused by seniors. this corresponds to a percentage of 10%.
Ten years later, in 2014, the seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.
By doing so, their share increased to 17.7%.
While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period.
The reputable ones did not appear in the published version of the article comments to the light that show the prejudices a few Japanese seemingly against older drivers:
The article on Yahoo on translation errors received the following comments:
- "Is this (" terrible motorists ") do not mean reality?"
"" "-" "" "wrong is the translation actually not, isn't it?" "" "" ""
"" "-" "" "I don't think it's a real translation error." "" "" ""
There are not a few such comments.
Why "Engrish" is spread so widespread in Asia throughout Asia
Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.

The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are varied.
For transferring two important capabilities: passive language skills, to understand the text-text and active language skills to transfer it into the destination language.
The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in native languages. generally, the belief that translators in the target language - do not have to be in the starting language - native language.
This is how a French native language should translate from English into French - not from the French into English.

Many Japanese companies do not employ a collaborator with English as a mother tongue who could produce translations into English. this may be due to an understanding of the sucking, cost-jumps or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.
Some companies, who have no foreign employees, have not yet been firmed. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English than the best, are made to translators, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.

Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.
The worrying and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation, show that this technology can still not replace a human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.
Some of the weightful English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that are often used by T-shirts or bags, are not used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.

Translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless. but of great companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.
The Kyoto's Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.
Venezuela: protests and interest measures on the internet and television
Main page of the Portals "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).
On Friday, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users, that they don't have access to online broadcaster Vivoplay.
Later other users wrote that the Internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were not yet accessible anymore.
Other online broadcaster transmited photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by opposition groups, which by the Government of Nicolás Maduro.
The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive, and the Supreme Court itself.
Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled, and recommended the Usern, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.
# Zensr: activates your VPN.
It seems that Internet pages Venezuelan providers are locked once again.
This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.
Offers such as vivoplay are popular in the Venezolanists with internet access, especially in times of unrest.
Traditional media have been hesitated over protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with purpenalties and closure, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, since the Commission saw it as a "Call for Violence."
Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I have filed myself at @ vivoplaynet.
Amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres lemonade.
The local NGO VEsinfilov later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online broadcaster. this also affects the website where the National Assembly carries their meetings.
Earlier research studies of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that local Internet service providers had to take advantage of DNS. this is a technology that will answer the DNS-server requests of certain domains.
If a website is blocked by DNS, the server does not answer or refuses the request to call such a website.
We confirm a DNS lock: @ elisoliv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet
When VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.
Flores was smitten, while he was in police custody.
Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV returned to the show.
Even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: thereby, the Venezolanern of access to multimedia reporting on the country's current events will always continue.
In Paraguay, many girls become a slave to get an apprenticeship
Tina Alvarenga was a cribta. now she visits the house where she worked for years.
Today Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and collects Zeus of other criadiers, which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination.

The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices with friendly authorization of the authors.
The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuanique Caen" ("Flying cows, decaying schools"), processed and published by Global Voices Latin America.
Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, in which she was not living together with the family who lived there.
Just before her studies at the University, she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride in her. she is like a daughter for us.
"" "the one has become something," "" "she said." ""
But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.
When she was ten years old, she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, it is called the more than 46.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.
The business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfer their underage-old son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.
What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to afford more days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you can't raise.
This as Criadazgo, practice, is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.
After finishing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.
In doing so, she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witness, reacted and denounced.
She tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude, that is vaccinated the criadiers, guaranteed to be silent in general.
"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.
It is the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the faith that they will improve their education, improve their position in society and "something from itself" can be translated to another family.
On the other hand, the family, which accuses the girl with faith, justifies that she would give someone a chance that would not have any education, and perhaps even starved.
The Victims of Criadazgo
When the girl harassed the girl, his family will only experience many years later.
Sometimes they never experience them.
In January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in paraguan households, got a face.
When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent stripes. in short, she died.
She was 14 years old.
She was Criadita in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the population of the population.
Marín was living in their home in Vaquería, a small village with 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.
At the end of January 2016 Ferreira proposed as long as with a stick to Marín, until they suffered fatal injuries.
This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.
A few days later the media reported over the incident.
They stressed that the murdered child was a cribta.
Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.
They noted the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."
Several dozen people came together in protest petitions and demanded that there were no further Carolina "in Paraguay.
The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.
"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.
Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.
Without official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.
The neighbors of the married couples and almost 60 civil society demanded an independent investigation.
They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.
If the case comes before the court, the case of Carolina Marín would be landmark, if for the first time in history, a case of criadazgo comes before the court.
The everyday life of a Criadita
Criaditas are not only exploited as labour force, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.
Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when Farbik, who worked in her father, had to register and lost their father's work.
Their brothers now had to work and began to buy money on the street or on the market of sweets to make money.
They went all further to school.
Only Tina has been sent to the capital Asuncion in the capital Asuncion.
In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.
It had to divide the time so that you stayed with learning still time.
She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.
On Fridays, she purged the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the ground.
When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time for learning.
The more they work with learning, the more leisure it had.
But this time was limited, because they had to do dinner for their employers.
Alvarenga says she had never starve, but didn't get an unlimited meal. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the householder than food from the fridge," she remembers.
The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.
On some departing of the landlords Alvarenga, next to him stand and Editorial made of opposition elements such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."
In doing so, he tried to persuade them to give the reports of the official media over the dictator's regime.
He kept her for intelligent, but did not sit with her. "the housekeeper had found someone who listened to, while he talked about politics," she says.
"" "" "" "they don't often allow me to visit my family, because they were the opinion that I would learn there again" "" "bad habits." "" "so they said that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, who would speak to their mother tongue Guaraní" "". "" ""
Their Lord feared that they had the education they had made, once again, explains them.
However, it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they paid from them, with their hard work.
"" "" "" "Alvarenga was also discriminated in school." "" "one thing about which almost never spoken are bullying and the chicans who are cribating when they go to school." ""
Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, has a cribta.
I couldn't invite anyone home. I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood.
In my youth, in time, where friends arise, I felt particularly clearly that I had belonged to any group.
Isolation was the worst of all, "says Alvarenga.
The Society approves the Criadazgo
In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view position for cleaning staff and babymaid in Paraguay.
The administrators of the Group is PEPA Kostianovsky, a city dreams in the Asuncion district.
Hello! I'm looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her.
For learning.
Please login to you.
Starting off Monday, if possible.
The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.
A woman from the place Ñemby wrote that she had an eleventh girl and gave their telephone number.
Another woman, who also came from Ñemby, offered her 15 year old niece. "she likes little children and is very pretty," she wrote.
"" "the third comment was written by" "" "a girl from the national homeland, which I want to work." "" "" ""
Then the author turned out once again:
Dear friends, I found one. I look if it works with her.
Thank you, I write again when something is.
The business was completed.
In prolog to the report Criobtas, ¿hasta cuándo?
(Criobtas, how long?), a collection of testimony, former Criobta, writes Ortiz:
In the course of our history we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice of early history), reading the Spanish conquistadores and the Spanish conquerors (which the workers of Guaraní had to be regarded as a Halb slaves) and that many girls and boys were still giving themselves a system of slavery, with which they will have light victims for abuse and exploitation.
The social inequality in Paraguay and the look of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Criadazgo.
Draft bill proposes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

Published under the Public Domain CC0.
"" "sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees have agreed to" "" "agreed on a draft bill to" "" "the Regulations regarding the" "" "use of social networks" "". "" ""
"" "" "" "if he is accepted by Parliament, users and social media must be registered in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""
Based on the law, a place would then be established, which is instructed, citizens and citizens to share a permit to share social media.
Within six months with acceptance of the law, user and users have to register in the site of their real names and personnel number numbers to use social networks.
Will it be missed to do this, so this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.
The bill that consists of six paragraphs and support in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others through a voice, video-based and text."
It is unclear how the law is set when it is assumed that Egyptian authorities are not able to impose the registration for users and users who do not register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation on stage of social media companies.
Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarians and promoters of the legislative elections, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username, and a password to come through the firewall that blocked Facebook. "
This could mean that Egypt is planning to raise a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians, to submit information on their identity to access the network.
But it's not known so far, that such plans stand.
Experts from the site are skeptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.
Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological (at German "leading research projects") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egypt Initiative"), told global Voices:
I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters which have to do with technology.
In my opinion, they imagine that as they have violent physical public and private spaces, it may also be done online.
If I take it seriously, it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to carry it to a trial process.
That is technically realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.
"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft first must be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before going to debate in the debate." ""
Whether his acceptance and acceptance will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military mind in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration on the image surface is present," says Raoof.
Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill of law against Cyber crime, in which a lifelong sentence for those provided for those who were found guilty to threaten the "public order" and "to protest."

High above in the mountains of Kurdistan's northeastern Iraq, the animal lady Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the astostly Persian leopards.
A subspecies of the larger leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wilderei, loss and fragmentation of its habitat and as they always find less spoils.
Why is this particular kind of Leopard so important?
As Raza shows up in the video, "is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is present.
The chance to see a Persian leopards in fact is small and goes to zero. as the team has therefore established that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, breaks out Raza in pure joy.
As a trained biologist shows Raza passionately likes another side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.
She has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.
She has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and set up for ensuring that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan Regional area are established.

Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate
"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."

In early March, 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, who had reached the progress made up in the last six years, had reached the life of those who had been affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had been triggered the disaster.
The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a common prefectures in Japan's Northeast, who had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.
Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to vanish because the tsunami had filled whole coastal cities from the map.
In addition, the Fukushima Prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone, some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.
The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view that progress has been achieved for six years, to rebuilding the life of the local population.
The detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese restoration authority as well as a survey of the affected themselves.
The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate
The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (of the city, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.
Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.
According to Iwate, 75 percent of such houses are finished, while Fukushima is the final light for Fukushima.
While still, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behnfswald, evacuated by shelters (marceterisu juutaku) resettlement to the final replacement parts.
After the threefold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelfswald.
In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.
Almost 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima still live in emergencies, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation of evacuees were moved after the disaster in Behelfswald, were resettled in final houses.
For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.
The stand of work and daily life in the three prefectures of the prefectures
As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their gateway to December 2016, which constitutes nearly 98 percent of schools in three prefectures.
Six years later, the industrial building in the three prefectures are much more difficult.
While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation once again, in Fukushima alone, only 30 percent of the fishing harbors have resumed their operation.
The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have been dragged.
Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.
It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic bomb, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are in the "nuclear wave zone."
In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered quickly again, but here Fukushima still remains undefeated.
The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again to 90 per cent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.
However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.
Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?
In order to determine a complete picture, the daily newspapers led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuation by. she asked them about the booth of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed over the tsunami risk.
In its introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:
The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey through to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population of experience.
The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the resident population has taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.
However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disasters associated with disasters.
As it stands for those who had evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture
In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.
Fukushima was not only forced to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, ever experiencing Japan.
Of the 160 000 evacuation of Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated in areas outside the prefecture.
At the beginning of 2016, something more than 23,000 people had been resettled back to Fukushima, which had been resettled in permanent sparity houses.
After the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their homeland prefecture.
In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation areas are still more than 50 years old. they are in proper ability to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.
The world is small: our podcast "Into the Deep"
When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences appear to be larger than the similarities.
After a while, however, we often see that a more unites than it seems at first sight.
These global connections are important because they demand our prejudices to expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately became very small.
In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat subjects that often get less attention when they deserve.
We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over speech and country borders.
Veronika Egherman talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Torana Macias talks about the time that she has worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.

Brasilian activity is made up of Brazilian Koma, after police raced by police in nationwide protests.

Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widely used photo.
A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care unit: last Friday the police officer had defeated him at a demonstration against the head in Goiânia a demonstration against the head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.
Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and suffered several fractures.
Doctors performed him this Saturday and moved it into an artificial coma now.
His condition is regarded as critical.
The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.
In the pictures also the face of the police officer, which was attacked with a striking stock. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.
After the incident, the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announces that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident recorded by the active service.
The pictures show the police officers, as he performs in Goiânia with his drumstick to the face of the students Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).
If a police officer was checked by a demonstrator and in the intensive care station, his face would see six months on television and the whole suppression would be justified.
"" "the" "" "Desneuralizador" "", "a press channel of media activists from Goiânia divided the video of Luiz da Luz, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics briefly appealed to him." ""
Another video showing the same scenes, but from another perspective, is also immersed in the social networks.
In the clip shown below, one sees the attack on Mateus down from the 50th second.
For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Goiânia, while he is in the hospital.
"be brave, Mateus.
Against police force. "
The drawing has been divided repeatedly in the social networks.
By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.
On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás in memory:
Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he had been sabotaged the Occupy Movement in secondary schools. and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked on the intensive care centre, after he was attacked by a policeman, who struck him with a punch stock.
Police officers
Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to the demonstrators last Friday to demonstrators against demonstrators.
Policemen were put at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber bullets and tear gas.
S & D Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police via speakers to abandon violence against protesters.
This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.
Once again, the Brazilian media are spun up by using the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window of windshield.
The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a broken glass window to meet with a photo of their title pages illustrative.
In contrast, the O Globo favored a cover story with a set-up bus.
There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken windshield than the protests of thousands of people who are serving the defense of a specific cause.
This is necessary to recognize, if you are strictly against any form of non-damage.
Here, the term "Vandalism" get a absurd, uneventful meaning, and the typical violence against the military police are intercepted with the title "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."
The abducts of forgotten villages in Cuba
With the introduction of the Act of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane seeds included the doors to the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)
The Municipality Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no notable sugar beest in the spot.
It is two years ago when the activities were painted in the sugar cane plants.
After the rise, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its investments until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.
Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.
Some changed the work.
Other signed and commutes daily to the factories, that still grind.
Nene, a Soldatenvelopan, opened every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep.
He heard that there are sugar cane seeds in the eastern region, which after long inactive time are in operation because they were preserved.
That was something he didn't expect.
Nene reminds you precisely that in Mañalich the sugar factory was preserved, but the promise was not kept.
The sugar industry resistance already withstands the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, Ineffsufficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.
In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.
The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the poor harvests are no more recent.
Why was the Cuban sugarcane industry switched off?
The old platform of the church saw better times.

The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive, they became unsustainable for the country.
Initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.
They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).
The solution for unemployment?
The motifs, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugarcane plantations and the growth crisis on the global market.
Nevertheless, the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.
From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar is between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "Agriculture institutions" published by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.
If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar supply would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.
Not everything went well
"today's day will go into history with safety," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.
From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.
In the following years, the lactation of a total of 98 sugar mill factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.
The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.
Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.
"" "if Nene is known as a soldier on the closing of the factory, the word that he repeats most," "" "deceit." "" "" ""
Almost all of those questioned are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.
In order to receive the place, they formed a full time - working group.
Before the first school year, the first letters began to come.
Officially, documents were officially distributed to documents related to the parts that would be removed, the addressee, and the date.
All were signed by Ulam Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any disapproving.
From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently.
Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-down factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still operating sugar mill factories."
Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.
He was involved in his will to disclosing the factory, whose construction he helped, was involved.
In every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.
The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers was wiped out.
In many cases there were no alternatives for the workplaces and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located.
We will never know if during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas that factories not have been in operation for five years.
The price of the population for the closure of the sugarcane milling
Sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004.

After two years the Municipality of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, that many things change, but not always better when a factory is closed.
When the sugar cane finished, or better said than they began to invade them, they also stopped to restrict the road to asphalted, this also disadvantaged other farms.
Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.
They were given to spare parts.
Without future perspectives, many young people left the region at once.
In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not even used for the provision of the community.
The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing.
End of 2016 Nene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.
Ninety-two slain the old soldiers to spend a two thousand peso per month to spend the years retired in Mañalich.
Mr. Nene, a man of black skin color, small, with a few teeth and clearer voice, is not a trageous person, yet he gives the lies that one told him not.
They torment him for ten years.
Nene goes to Rente for 65 years, not because it is lacking in force but because he is bittered.

First Nations teens use hip-hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
Take a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.
Photo used with the permission of N'we Jinan.
Young Nations communities in the whole of Canada are busy with topics that are important for them. they are doing with hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.
Since 2014, part of the N'we Jinan-Tour offer mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres, in order to bring youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.
The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.
The workshop will ensure that the young participants in discussions such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" or whatever the meaning comes in the sense.
These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.
Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.
This video of the School 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in WestCanadian, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.
The cases were mostly not cleared.
The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, as important for obtaining traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalisation.
Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, even though the young people are unable to master the languages of the First Nations.
In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.
The youngsters involved some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-hop Group, who gave them a Strophone in the Eastern-Eastern James Bay Cree.
On the facebookside of N'we Jinan is available the rophe into transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:
Sometimes I feel, as no one would ever care for me
But I try to continue my days on Earth
That's the day you'll take our cry out
Because we lost our way in life as a youth
But I believe we will rise one day
I don't want to see how they live a bad life
So they can grow and go forward as well as our youth.
Thus, they can do what it intended for the Creator
In comment, the reader and supporters of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also provides a contribution and adds the rophe in syllings (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission to be published):
In Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
Plastic dishes (tribulation of the city) outside of typical restaurants in Japan.

In Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.
To show potential customers what is located exactly on the menu, will be found near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (martial arts, "Plastic Products of the dishes") of each food that is served in this restaurant.
Customers look at this plastic dishes, and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.
There is an entire industry devoted to manufacturing this plastic dishes.
In the Kappabashi District Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that made the German Film filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.
For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them again. however, a new trend is transformed into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.
The Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with shokuhin.
Now available in special sale: new with plastic shredded mobile tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.
Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection, as in this case, fridge magnets:
Here are a few shots fridges for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.
The new boom in the Essentifications is increasingly elaborate.
In this case, an kaisen-don (a popular travel cycle with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone support.
For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.
We also have made this part for the Tokyo Exhibition.
And here is an apple, who are holding your mobile phone:
Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for mobile phone, this is already a great design.
And this is just the beginning of a growing flight into the comic.
Some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikenura or salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.
On Twitter, some users had their doubts:
"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can cheating my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""
I think I will be the only one.
This interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.
Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melon ice.
In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and molybanders from dried salmon.
Other skimmrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to hashtag # 1.
If you like to know more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to exposure to the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpurse.
The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured.
A Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
"for the victims of the fight against drug dealers."

In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug dealers" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly occur only in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself.
The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Kartells, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.
On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the streets or to the municipalities that have learned to live with pain.
There are behind every corpse, behind every bone fund, in the hundreds of bones, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never cure.
This is why the Mexican News portal Animal Político has called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with the drug trade,") to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.
Animal político describes the project:
Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.
The implications are much deeper.
For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers, and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.
The Pain of Victims
A video entitled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how much life has changed") just tell these stories.
A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is searching for secret graves after his son.
Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only a single day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.
Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task before we have made us go, and after the graves we have loved to seek."
Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.
He was 28 when he disappeared.
He has three children.
He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.
On October 13, he left the house.
On October 15th he should be back again, but he never arrived. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am alone with three children who need a training.
There is also my mother, who is also here with me.
At the moment they have no income.
You are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't pay it out because they demand a death certificate.
"" "where should we get that?" "" "" ""
The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:
We must not only show the faces of those who pose a fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership.
The project is based on readers of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.
Here are some extracts from the stories.
KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.
Your contribution reminds us that violence should never look at normal as normal, regardless of what form it occurs:
I have been aware of the disease and sensor journalism for some years now.
I arrive every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures that are actually only from a textbook for criminals or from the specialists of specialists.
It spends me out of the version.
Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who had disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.
I can't be indifferent, or consider this as normal.
She continues to write:
No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers), when it is tall. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders if they go through the streets.
For me this is, when would they mourn those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that.
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.
The inaction of people is incredible to me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour was justified that they were "settled."
I think they try to talk about that they will be spared of such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent.
Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the capital District: how a family with threats became plundered." in this, it describes as armed criminal month for the month of money from their business until they were not only destroyed the business, but also their family apart.
You think of everything you lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.
The pain, it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again if you are alone.
Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.
We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.
The more we are removed from each other, the better.
She joined her report with the words:
We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will dispossess or kill you.
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deepest root feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn how to live with pain.
The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of Violence."
In the introduction he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?
How is it to grow up in a settlement at the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?
He is not like other young boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.
Bryan is a fatherless and he tells us to teach himself how to make an egg boiled, potatoes brewed, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.
He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.
But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and that had to learn to live with it.
When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.
But this was not the day when his childhood ended.
His childhood has already passed two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car.
When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.
In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders and the Government of Public Safety and the Government of the United States.
In 2010 alone the public prosecutor's office 3103 murders were counted, equivalent to 8.5 murders per day.
These are some hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.
Only a few stories still live in the face of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who do not forget.
In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal político is set up in 2015 with the objective of portraying the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the past four decades, in understandable manner.
When a picture is worth a thousand untrue words
"Sharing is Caring" from Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and the pages where he is linked, include pictures where violence is represented.
The fact-check is important in a moment where it comes to lifting a rumor or to unmask a fake.
But how is the years after the first time emerged? content in social media, whether true or unexpected, tends to pass on.
Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Since its first release, it has been fully exploited, tragedies to beep tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.
This wrong clutch of image and event - "false description" or "false Context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.
But it raises questions about our demand for pictures too.
What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
In 2010, a tank-car crossed the site Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded. 230 people came into life.
After the civil war Africa's second biggest country had been neglected and thus devastated. the streets in the region became more dangerous plainers, which were difficult to befall.
Tragically, the tanker fell victim to the victims.
We described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a movie near, which was full of people who witnessed the football World Cup.
Houses scattered and pertinted corpses scattered in the streets.
Many people were burned to the ignorance.
A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Mehrere photos of the incident make the grey scenes this day.
Up is an example.
It shows rows of hollow bodies, which are rounded up during the floor while people look at them.
But this is not the end of the story.
Over the years, the same photo was captured several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but they seem to be attributed to the related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.
What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar?
On January 3, 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the dragatory villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.
Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before they had to flee.
Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.
There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.
However, the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one stayed back to count corpses," said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch.
Many have been dismembered, shot or burned.
The follow-up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.
The reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the Boko Haram's attempt to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).
And here the picture appeared on the DR Congo again, as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:
That is Nigeria.
A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.
They are not Charlie.
They are dead.
In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.
In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass strikes.
A step further, personal comments, such as the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.
The picture from Sange came in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.
According to a flash message, the UN described those who could flee, rape and some dead, some by burning.
While others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following, which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:
This image comes from an acidic news page, which falsely said that President Myanmars Than have said, monks and politicians had participated in the Assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to record these information.
The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.
Other news organisations, AFP as their source, had also falsely accused Than His statement, but did not allow the image from the DR Congo in relation to them.
The global operating range of false information
Tracks of this wrong coupling until the years 2011 and 2012 are actually coming back to all over the world.
Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far information limits can be exceeded.
A reverse picture search engine with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 Pictures, which are very similar to the discussed image from the DR Congo.
They come from a mixer of private sites, platforms social media and common areas as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.
Some have forwarded false reports, some have tried to unmask the counterfeits.
We have made examples of the abuse of use and associated with the respective countries, based on which page it had been published. therefore, we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language only.
Examples listed below (which in some cases were also linked to each other) can date several examples of misuse.
Here are some cases that can still be felt completely (on the map in orange):
Map: News Frames.
Country examples of false couplings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar.
The orange countries refer to pages or servers, which are still available in the examples of counterfeiting or falsies, are still available.
The countries in grey are examples that are available according to the metadata and information that are available via TinEye, probably also counterfeiters.
As a memory, the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo (in blue).

France, 2015.
According to the Boko Haram massacre as shown here, the image from the DR Congo used to illustrate the "atrocities of Islam" have clearly seen no sides such as Hoaxbuster who contradict this.
Hoaxbuster named the flawed use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria, then promoted by a post office of US American, anti-Islamic commentator Pamela Geller.
Germany, 2017. "genocide against Muslims go further in Myanmar, Nobel Peace Laureate."
This article focuses on continuing distress of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, but cited the work of an article in Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo; the article in Indian Express had not included the time of publication of our contribution.

This assertion was denied by a Greek fact check-in 2013 and once again in 2016.
Iran, 2012.
A Association of the students of theology (Mullahs) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Rohingya Muslims in Nasim's news agency and to illustrate the image of the DR Congo.
Italy, 2015.

Malaysia, 2015.
Malaysia offers two extreme example for an abrupt use of the image from the DR Congo, with one hand on a Tweet, the sympathy compared to the Nigerian massacre, and on the other hand, the attempt of a blog, the claims that Rohingya are persecuted, to dellilac, since the photos were misused.
Myanmar, 2017.
The government of Myanmar has published a judge for what it meant as "decreasing messages and photos, the international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misconceptions regarding Myanmar."
This judge, which is exclusively published in English, includes references to fake images of rumors who are using Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to determine that Muslims kill Buddhists and elsewhere (what is often widespread by Burmese nationalists).
Russia, 2012. "mineral water with terrace." (Christianophobia or political provocation?).
This post, which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church, reveals that the DR-Congo's image shows Muslims who kill Christians.
Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014
This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Than existed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.
The article has been updated in 2014 and this release is still included in this release.
Spain, 2015 / 2016.
This article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now soldered, the Catholic near the news page Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the picture is not of the killings, but it claims that it was a similar one-like attack.
When the picture appeared in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 in circulation, the El Pais attempted to oppose it into Nigeria.
Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).
The DR Congo picture appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in Paris and the proposal on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.
They wanted to achieve that their communities took this event, which took place in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.
United States, 2015.
The picture was swept up for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times kneaded). but the messages that were connected with it were not taken up in any religious context.
Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.
Vietnam (ese), 2014.
After a message was recorded by a "Pater Juan Carlos Pascal" about the Nigerian massacre was in circulation, discussion forums, as described here on Vietnamese and declared it to the falsehood.
From the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Clarinet Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.
There are further confirmed examples of a erroneous use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.
Other accounts, Aggregators and pages in the following countries (based on portfolio in grey), are also no longer traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.
(data entries with URLs and time- / date stamp exist in the webcrawler and united them to Muslims with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)
In all these cases, which was first published clearly according to the original disaster of 2010, the image is probably probably a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.
Frames and images
There are two strong themes or frames (irradiation) that move through this posts. the first frame focuses on religion.
The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murdered victims of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.
A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.
Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.
However, a deeper question is what happens when reading these images could not give any longer faith.
With social media, there are many people who unintentionally share the share of drinking water around a tragedy.
Suggests this mood of misleading and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorns it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?
The distribution of non-violent images was already debated in detail (for example).
An argument is that, to detect the rejection of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.
At the same time, the concern is that nonviolent images, readers, and viewers assume the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which interact as violent media to help others).
While there are some more violent representations in the news media, it is fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.
Technologists experimented because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to reconsider thoroughly about situation in which a picture is somewhat suggests, but in context of context or totally abused type can be used.
An investigation of false assurances should be considered as an international investigation as well.

Photo of Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC BY-ND 2.0 license.
A blog with the name UnTranslatable (e.g. incomprehensible) endeavoured to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to be translated.
These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often complex or specific.
Some of these incomprehensible words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish brake).
But everyone resists stubbornly to every attempt of a simple translation.
A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation, and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.
These unique words have been collected for a whole period in an online list.
Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.
In the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu's language, such as:
"vakasteglok" - Bemba yourself for your parents in recognition of how to make you endeavor for yourself in your younger years.
And words in the Hunsettle language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:
"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that you feel after having grown in cold days in the sun.
In Birds's own words from his blog about:
They grind other cultures, reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.
Sometimes you influence us how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguist on this page would like to publish and show more of these "unparalleled" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.
Redner of the "Treasure Languages" which are appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite characters.

Just like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe in the decade
The Sri Lanka archipelago is currently facing the worst flooding and landslide catastrophe in this decade.
Fired by the monsoon, which usually takes place in late May, are caused by strong rains to the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.
According to a review of the Sri Lanka catastrophic plane from 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the flooding and sludge.
Over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 secure residence types.
The rains left on Saturday (May 27), and the waters in some areas were slowly back.
Health and hygiene ratios constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.
The following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of flood catastrophe:
High tide at Tawalama city with water-walls of up to 7.5 metres. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the high water situation.
Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of disaster.
Sri Lanka's fatal floods worsen over the crisis, Save the Children, after further rains are already on the way.
Today the Neluwa bus was standing in the high water level, water level up to 6 meters. village Moragoda near Galle also flooded because of the last martyrs of the Morogoda Ela yesterday.
The Air Force has made five aircraft for rescue operation and another five are made for transport of emergency deliveries to the inhabitants included in their flooded villages.
Different organisations and startups have also explained to help.
Facebook pages like Help Flood VICTIMS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information regarding high water situation and humanitarian assistance.
If you need any search and lifejacket drones for their operations, please call the number 0774844639.
For individuals who want to donate dry foods and lifellows for flood victims -
Today we are in the region around Keleniya and Himbutana.
Please call the number 077744929 or 0777843841 if animals need help in this area.
The Taxiruf App pickme (Sri Lanka) asks for worries people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the catastophacenter will be informed.
Last year after the disaster of the tropical Storm Roanu, PickMe took a "high water aid" key, allowed users allowed to call a vehicle to pick up help and donations. these were then forwarded to the slankic Red Cross.
"" "likewise, they led a" "" "SOS" "" "key, which had included more than thousands of requests and 150 successful reboretariat for high water and landslides included people." ""
The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exhausted, put residents in need in need of security and help the aid of assistance.
This has prevented the loss of other human lives, the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long way up to restore normality.
The Muslims you can't see
The Women's March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco.
Photo by Sahar Habib Ghazi.
Use in January, when in January, I took part in the Women's March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend.
I trusted her four years old daughter, she trusts her children; she is my rock in the surf.
In the one minute we call paroles for women's rights.
In the next sketch we add rights to transgender.
We are located in a sea of umbrellas and people, some keep the iconic picture of a woman with headscarf, bound from an American flag, others will fight against Islamophobia.
My girlfriend looks at me and says, "These things concern not you," or? "why, because I am not Muslim?," I ask.
I have already led this conversation.
People, with whom I work or people who have known me for years, separate me - the Sahar that they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has set up in their performance.
They muslify me.
There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.
We don't see all the same.
We practice our religion different.
We recognize ourselves to be a Muslim, in different kind. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.
This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims, that are not fit there, discarded.
Unformized will be decapitated
I don't stand alone.
This is even the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.
What pictures come in a sense when you think of it?
Love?
Peace?
When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I was now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.
Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.
But in the western idea religion Rumis was deleted, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.
This deleting makes a big part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.
Another consists of Muslims in the reductionist images of Muslims, which has been colonial books for centuries.
This enticing picture language is determined by the dark men that you should fear and the exotic woman who should save.
The landmark of Palestinian-American scientists Edward Said put the story behind these images in the 1970s.
But these images are even further developed today.
Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood are still ongoing.
I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I saw how this powerful, erroneous narrative dominate our newsfeeds.
This narrative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries in the last three decades, while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.
This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are encouraged to bear their headscarf in public buildings and avoid sudi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same medal.
A powerful group exercises his "control" to the "other."
This powerful narratively weakened Muslim women who lead movements for change.
It is over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans, which were brought down with slave ships.
It deletes the existence of Queer-Muslims.
This narrative has deeply impressed our collective pretensioning strength, often sighting men and children become the objective of anti-mic attacks and seizures.
Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "others."
To the 1.7 billion belong
In the news industry we do more than telling stories that are based on facts.
Or on alternative facts.
We also create narratives, helping us understand the world.
And "" "" "" "and my industry has failed to certify the narrative of the 1.7 billion." ""
And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of "religious group in America."
More than one-third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans.
Six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation which come from 77 countries.
The parents of the author 1976 in New York.
Utilization approved.
Four decades ago, my parents immigrated to New York to live their American dream.
My mother laid her first jewellery design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York; skyscrapers were allowed by the Muslim, American Stacker from Bangladesh with the name Fazlur Rahman Khan.
Back then, when Khan thinking about the world's Skylines, my parents were undisputed Muslims and Americans.
But am I undisputed Muslim and American?
Sometimes, if people ask me why I don't eat pork, I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my handsome handkerchiefs who carry all Muslims with respect - "from respect to Peppa Wutz."
I jesting, we do not wear all handkerchiefs with us.
We don't need to be theological expert in order to be "Muslim," or almost always to be selected for additional safety checks at the airport.
There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists who make efforts to fight widespread lies on Islam.
These lies are produced by a well-tasted Islamophobia, think tanks and experts for counterfeit information which is our already flawed picture of what a Muslim is; or what Islam is, manipulated.
Because of the stories we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it, Islamophobia in more than just a foreigner, who plucked the headscarf with a woman.
Or as the scary map of attacks on mosques in the whole USA, see below.
Screenshot of the ACLU website.
Islamophobia in its ugly forms attacks our affiliation.
It addresses our identity that is so far-reaching, so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer.
The author was built in 1986 on a photograph of her kindergarten group.
Utilization approved.
I want to explain this.
I was born to be Muslim, but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old, in a temporary mosque in the basement of a presbyterian church in New York.
If social scientists describe religious life, they rely on the following terms: faith, conduct and affiliation.
My Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible, but they are there.
Maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor, my neighbor, my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that will separate our houses.
She would see the evening ritual with my daughter, when I kept them in my arms, and you would be called the Arab-verses to protect the Koran and called the Quls.
I repeat three times each of them.
Therefore, I ask you to be protected from evil, the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see.
My Muslim faith is possibly not always visible, but my Muslim supplements are always part of my shadow.
The grandmother of the author, when she gains a Ikebana competition in Karachi, with her sisters eventually posing in the 1960s.
Utilization approved.
Affiliation is the image of my grandmother's maternal side with their sisters; as they win a competition of the art of flowers in Karachi decades ago.
It is the image of her that I see my eyes close: nano, surrounded by their completed and unfinished paintings of the Sufi-saint; and an Korans with many bookmarks, a book with one hundred and fourteen capitals which it can be almost rotated.
To be Muslim, to speak the prayers that they had said to me when I have a bad day.
To be Muslim, as they taught me to refer to God, Allah Mian what God means, my only Lord.
For a nation that has been colonial over centuries - by an "Empire," which has founded a company with the name of honest British Ostinidia-Komarie, it has a deep meaning, God, my only Lord.
The author was born in 1987 with her grandfather.
Utilization approved.
Belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not weep, but at the same time to see my infringed grandfather wept.
Zwischrin, while he writes books on modern Islam and over the independence of Kashmirs, Nana Jaan wept around his family in India's ruling cashmir, family that he was not allowed to close in half a century.
Affiliation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians, whose families, like in my grandfather, were torn apart from colonialists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk.
To be Muslim means that over the past two centuries, Europeans have been colonial to four Muslim countries. "
It means to know that the first flipper bomb was thrown off before a century over a Muslim country.
It means to know that at the same time, Grandfather of my grandmother, an Indian, kaschmiric subjection of the British Empire, was called "dangerous" by the newspapers of his time, as he led the first mosque in England.
Even before there was airplanes, he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love, peace and social justice.
The Word of Islam.

To my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back deeply into our unforgettable pedigree; our unexpectant history.
It means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world, with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from Antarctica, to hunt mass destruction that did not exist.
It means to know that more than half a million Iraqis buried under the ruins of the war.
An American Muslim means to know that the veterans of veterans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001.
It means to know that when a tragedy is home to the US and suspects a Muslim name, the story will report four times more than a story with a white assassin.
It means to know that four hundred years ago, the first prayer call, the Azaan, was called Bilal from a free black slaves.
It means to know that two hundred years ago, a African Islamist called Bilali Muhammad was enslaved and brought to this country.
It means Malcolm X call an American hero.
It is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban.
It's the hope I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life.
An American woman, a pimi, a cashmiri, an Punjabi, an Punjabi, a Muslim, and a journalist, signifies the inherent intersectionality of our multilingual conjunctions, but to fail to communicate them to others.
"" "the narrative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube, but is represented in the reduced branch" "" "against" "". "" ""
To be a mother, to provide me with my child, and all Muslim children, knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islamophobia.
Structural Islamophobia is supported by President Bush in the Muslim registry, and under President Obama, under President Obama.
It consists in perceptible monitoring of mosques.
It consists of immigration agents who adopts a five-year-old child in handcuffs.
It consists in a country that excludes its limits to people from just countries that bombed it.
It's a false and nebulous "no-fly list," which largely takes Arab and Muslims.
We are the wars that we lead, and the bombs, which we throw in Muslim countries.
Because of the stories we tell and because of those who don't tell us, we are here today.
In a study entitled Ascent of Man, scientists from Northwestern University participants showed a scientifically relevant image and asked them to assess the groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution.
Muslims received the smallest score.
The conversation we have to lead
We are too deep to reveal the Muslim, or the "others."
We are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears, and the flawless and dangerous expression, which we steamed in our news conference.
At least there is a growing movement, led by American Muslims in the media industry that tries to capture our multiple identities and forgotten history.
The Podcast See Something, Say Something of Buzzfeed; the Podcast # GoodMuslim BadMuslim; the viral video series Secret Lives; Simon & amp; Schuster Salam Reads, an initiative, proliferating Muslim authors, and Ms Marvel, the PAKISTANISH, Muslim, American Superheroine - all this makes me hope.
Screenshots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and intersectionality of Muslim American life.

But I am concerned because of this difficult global period of time, in which we are located.
And this moment has some consequences of going beyond the 1.7 billion.
There is a reason that conspirators, who existed in the dark corners of the Internet, now run the White House.
They have grown exponentially, because they have made Muslims to "others."
There is another group that has grown exponentially by making the "other" created.
A few years before, it had not been given them; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq.
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I wasn't aware of when I was so old, as it is now my daughter, but that made me today to an undisputed Muslim.
Things I have left here like a break of bread in my speech.
Things that might wake memories, because in all those interactions that make our humanity, a story likes to listen to a "others."
Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley you will find conversation within the 8th Annual Meeting on Islamophobia.
More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the "other," structural racism "and" American militarism. "
However, these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read that we read in our newspapers.
Poster of the Facebookside of the Islamophobia Studies Network.
We all need to ask ourselves, why?
Why do I tell that here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who has shown us how wars will be led, and people through the monkeys of the "others" will be enthused in public performance, four decades ago even research of Stanford.
We must uncomfortable ask ourselves according to the role of his, conscious and unconscious of the "other" as it did my girlfriend and I think we have a new future in which we have no presidents, while having already bombed countries and "to other-made" people, go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.
It starts here with all of us.
Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban freedom
Storytellers count, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.
Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with someone in connection?
For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in its original language is an answer to this.
Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unreplaceable blog.
Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the language diversity of large cities.
In fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has been conducted since 2015 events, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there.
For the creators of the project:
The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided, if we do cities, accept diversity - safe rooms, in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to.
"" "while" "" "Listen is often connected to understand" "" "check out these events instead" "" "listening to feeling, to feel." "" "" ""
In this format, storytellers ask her story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.
Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their depiction are that the listeners will slip on it.
They cry out laughing and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.
The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story of storyteller Rassidatou takes the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of narrative art.
In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the bunny and the pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:
After explaining the importance of his fork, John Nyamusara is asked, "How is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of the included:
You have heard!
They were attentive...
They were quite with me!
So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities and organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can join TLS in order to organize their own storyteller performances.
Puerto Rico calls for state debt of state debt
With the aim of a retrial of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march was launched at the puertorian capitol, the capital building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the Old Town of San Juans.
She was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizenship) and the Okomenian church of Puerto Ros.
The advocates of the remuneration of debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.
This is their demand:
The people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians, bankers and government agencies are responsible for the debts of their corruption.
We call for financial testing and an management committee without personal interests in public debts, with a solid, our working conditions of the respective remuneration that acts in favor of the economy.
We will be pressed and suppressed.
The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt, which is not her.
We will not choose between education and health.
Our pensioners will not invade their retirement pension payments.
We require immediate action.
The island - not in the state of an integral part of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.
Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socio-economic development, a law governing state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view.
These are their reasons:
The economic and financial crisis, Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.
"" "" "" "the measures imposed on the outside continued to run by the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger, rejected by the people." ""
The demonstration carried out the name "Nightingache for Light and Truth."
Here are some impressions:

Artist and writer acknowledge the work of the missing Syrian developer Bassel Safadi
Bassel Safadi and his wife Noura.
Photo of the Facebookside of Noura Ghazi Safadi.
The syrically-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi is known for over a year.
But he is not forgotten.
More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporters and members continue to continue their freedom and remember the contributions that he has done for an open network.
At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that will be hosted in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.
Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Income (The Cost of Freedom: a collective replica).
The book, published in the last year, has been released here, contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.
It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.
In the introduction, it says:
This book wants to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with which this is associated.
Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on site to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and make some sense from our different experiences.
This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet-volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.
His name was knitted from the list of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on October 3, 2015.
We have not seen any information about his current state or residence.
The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family to provoke him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.
To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.
Why are we here today?
What did we choose for?
What have we abandoned in this process of temporal beliefs?
The Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.
In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.
His wife, the writer and attorney Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken part on the basis of a "strictly secret" of the military court from his cell in Adra. "
Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by a alleged death sentence against her husband.
However, his place and state remains unknown.
A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.
Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:
Perhaps none of bass-cultural prototypes was more predicting than the work that he began around in 2005 with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.
Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayside of several civilians and merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.
At that time Bassel wasn't able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything about this architecture, not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.
This stripping in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as scientists and artists in the future.
Tragically, Bassel could not close this project yet.
Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.
I am overwhelmed when I call his name.
Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in custody.
I have learned to read English well, to write and speak English.
He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.
Bassel opened me the gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.
He brought me the internet.
He also taught other detainees as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually kept one in their hands.
Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a proxy, which she wrote in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.
Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.
She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him, and he translated them from the Arab into English.
The book is licensed free.
Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.
The book is dedicated to the public domain.
Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":
It happens in every visit,
That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,
That I lose my reflection in the moment, in which we embrace us,
That any of the dangers, no matter,
Each of the fences, shackles and guards
I forget the prisons of prisons
And I dringe in every detail your voice and words.
I wear the passion for me,
If your eyes say empty
And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...
I quickly return to my loneliness,
To get all the moments,
And about your absence to weep and to smile.
I testify to myself, that I will return soon...
On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:
Passing a year, my soul
During
I am in your cage,
And you're still in the cage's cage
Bassel's story is not unique in Syria.
Since the beginning of protests in 2011, Bashar al-Assad's regime has disappeared for more than 65,000 people in the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).
Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime, tortured or even executed.
Since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in custody.
The stories of many other people remain unknown.
The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.
Today, we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.
Mozambique: due to corruption was sentenced to previous post by corruption.
The Mozambique reacted with wrath on a corruption case, when a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state machine in which corruption was committed.
This is the arrest of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 along with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for the disappointment of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 euros).
The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Rat Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.
Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and promptly called his relocation into the company, which happened on 19 April.
In accordance with a position of the General Attorney General of the Republic, who accepted the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, to refer to his old posts, as the company did not fully comprehend a disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.
However, many residents do not like this action well.
The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, brief CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned to the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview:
Imagine a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.
What we take in mind is that the company should have a disciplinary proceedings against the contradicts.
However, the company kept silent, however, and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions.
Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "conflicting":
If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be an advisor, after he was sentenced to prison and served half.
He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.
But since he is incompetent, he has approved to be integrated into the company that he helped damage harm.
Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.
Contradictory!
Bitone Viage, young mosaic and student of political science in Brazil, the director says no morality:
Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he did not believe it, I can't believe it was rewarded with such a way that the state has already received such massively.
Cambaza is missing the morality and serve to the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead allowed himself to the state.
Cambaza did the state as a handsome of the inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, who is invited and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.
Honestly, I don't know why this guy has been rewarded.
Francey Zeúte prefers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief belongs to the prison:
Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent President, but also as sharp as sharp as sharp as a sharp and - incidentally - prophetic orator.
One of its most famous oral images, when he confirmed that "an ambitious person is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."
Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person is changing, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn from his ambitions.
An ambitious person is the same as criminal. "
In Twitter, the reactions were also leaning:
Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years old and arrived free.
And today he sets him the company, with which he was gelding, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Selected αences (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017
Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to dt.: @ truth) states that crime in Mozambique is paying off:

Facebook has blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users
The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means a chickpea or spyfish.

According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.
Although the background of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to assign up to human indian origin or generally used as an adjective. "
Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or that of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.
In recent years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely abrasive connotation.
In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar.
But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.
'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself is not calling on an automatically Hasspronunciation.
The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts who have discussed the use of the word or expressed a doubt for his use to be expressed.
Moreover, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.
For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same characters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spherical), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).
The Facebookbook Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':
One post of my friends was erased today because he contained the word Kalar.
However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way if she knew how he could lint his back pain by making a word play.
The proposition ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.
There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.
Zin Win Hire is the opinion that it will be more radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical that Facebook has to be analytical that it dissolves all the posts that were suspected to spread racism in suspicion.
Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.
It filly the word automatically.
The automatism does not understand what you are writing on Facebook.
What to do instead, is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the next words.
For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (palette knife).
The good thing is that this dirty nationalists, the hate language disseminate a pretty good lesson.
Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.
While the action is a powerful signal to everybody, the hate language does not like to spread the efficiency of this strategy.
The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often going to start a catch- and mouse game, with the user of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.
The author of Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete its posts, when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:
... when I was aware of this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.
Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I gave the liking, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours because the post "" "" the Facebook community "" "" did not speak. "" "" "" "
Facebook has a number of people away from people who have no negative intentions or simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate-speaking nationalists.
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:
Post without hate speech by Facebook.
In the Post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.
Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more than expected on the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask Council:
Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.
Such words, only hatred will bring hatred within the different communities.
It seems like if they have started this without local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "Insencurry" have been prohibited.
Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they do not tried to rectify the falsely deleted posts.
If only a little more respect for the 15 million use they would have a great turnover, that would be great.
Facebooks automatic censorship has received a lot of spoilt by users.
Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hasspronunciation to see if their posts are taken from the network.
Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that are not contained in Hasspronunciation, but still removed:
Used with permission.
The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch a pea curry dish and watching an Indian film.
Just to try whether Facebook contains the mail which contains the word Kalar. "
Screenshot, used with permission.
The post says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"
Screenshot, used with permission.
Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who used social networks to extend their votes and their influence, increased.
Among other things, hate speech in social networks may also preheat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where there were fighting between Muslims and Buddhists.
Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out the balancing Hassaries on his burmese sites under control.
But instead of using the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running, rather in context than upon code focused initiatives and learned from them.
In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is at the end of the daytime

The childcare is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.
On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law which aims to ban this practice, so that it is now wise at age 18.
Prior to this change of the adultery, some members were noted in practice, and in May 2016, it came to a huge public outcry (IRO), a group, the representatives of the various religious groups in the country, that the state should not interfere with the state that the state should not determine the maturity. "
This happened, despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contract partner of the UN Child Labour Convention, the minors of persons under 18 years of age. "
Statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married in the age of 15, Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.
In 2011, the country's statistical significance confirmed that from 1997 to 2007, more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.
Online petitioning and social media movements, who endeavors to abolish laws for children, followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support. no doubt they helped bring about this outcome.
Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.
A Hindu guides, for instance, had no concerns to say the critics of the children, they ought to take care of their own affairs. "
This kind of religious opposition intended for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts, whether the opposition would agree to the bill.
But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the Opposition and an independent that could be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would take him to the law.
Now only the president of the country agrees and declare the law.
One of the country's senators issued a status update on Facebook that Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:
Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes in the House of Representatives.
After he had decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.
The majority of social media users was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to children.
Dear Francis, who was a member of the ministry of education in the Ministry of Education, said:
It has too much time and unnecessary sense, used the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's care is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is almost every price.
During Abel Jackson's opinion, it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally arrived:
Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says: real news!
The bill has been decided.
Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "
Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law is noted:
The holier age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious affiliation 18 years.
The draft on the amendment of the Ehegesetz was today, on 9 June 2017.
There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and were present 35 by the vote.
All MPs, who were against the law, agreed for the law.
Children care is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed.
It was a long battle (...) # childmarriageischildi.
Many thanks to all activists who have deposited him.
Congrats. congratulations.
Thanks to our deputies.
But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organization of the country.
Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to take court steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to resolve his promises.
During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a supporters of the law said it was quite clear when Maharaj wanted to proceed against the law, most social media users were desirable to go into the debate on the subject.
Patricia Worrell proposed:
Dear Sat, if we, instead of speaking the discussion so commonly, in a way that only panic and imony may cause it to talk about the state in our bedrooms that it may be abused to them that they may be abused by large, hard-slanted men that are misused against them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?
Or do you think it is not a problem?
But if it comes to a court case against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children's children are legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they say.

By using web sites, Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content once more
The Wikipedia page was presented to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation on January 18, 2012.
Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)
For more than one month, Turkey has now locked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle of based encyclopedia Wikipedia.
Day for day is more evident, how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information.
Students as well as reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock.
Although many techniquent Internet users are used to use changing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.
Although Turkey has been locked out by Wikipedia, just as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society was held at Harvard University, finding regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.
In China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship by Wikipedia.
While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often are often updated).
A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform released all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. computer-host links), which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.
The content is available in spite of legal ban.
In a Blogpost reports IPFS about his efforts:
After having heard the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to complete snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is a possibility to read the contents of decentralized and distributed manner.
This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the www.wikipedia.org website.
IPFS also provided that this step was run independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.
However, Wikimedia involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.
Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansizpe.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar MirrorPages that is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.
Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:
It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a Mirror.
One is accessing another URL, which is not the original. that which one can see is by Wikipedia.
Essentially, the server leads the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if these are locked in Turkey.
Because this is done by a server, which is not in Turkey.

Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and balanced colours.
This motivated him to bear a camera, and try to graze the situation.
Back then he was a child.
Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepton to bring Nepal on international stage to the international scene.
And his homeland is right next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that drive the attention to Nepalese wildlife.
He described Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:
I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!
I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) invited me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.
The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.
Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.
My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was once and I immediately began to knead pictures!!
Sagar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.
And he ought to know, for he stood by face to face to face:
A tiger can't disturb anything from the opinion of sheep!!
Late in the evening. light is too weak.
Sleep time for all animals and birds.
Also I was in the darkness at home, when suddenly the King of the boy appeared. he sits immediately, we see and he stares me through the sal trees!!
To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to its photos.
However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wildlife is not always easy.
He waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otter in the Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. up to 12 days until he was able to take a tiger and take six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.

After the marriage, Indian women had their first time to appeal to their husbands's name

This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.
A revised version was once again published as part of an content-sharing agreement.
In many parts of India there are women with great care, to address the name of their husbands, or even older men in the family.
Instead, they use an pronouns or say "father of my child."
From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women to respect the husband due to social pressure, and fear of consequences should they accuse the norm, these practice will receive life.
Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a placebo court and violated her family and the village community after having addressed a preheated relatives with names.
The tradition of their wives, also not even named among men, is also common among men. however, they have far less supplements to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.
In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main feature of the city.
It is a place just for them, to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patriarchate.
As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and sets itself for the mining of the Patriarchate.
Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices, such as children's marriage to the network of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.
It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and they simultaneously made the murals of the wall.
The first video showing the Rohini in their discussion round was women who did not call their husbands at name.
She decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, with which women can easily identify themselves.
To address the name of their husbands, an attempt to reckon all obligations and never questioned them will never be questioned.
Rohini means:
This tradition testified that a woman has respected her husband and wishes a long life.
A woman who doesn't enter this will be regarded as a reclisant, as a woman without morality.
The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this discussion round about this discussion round.
At the beginning, Rohini who has never named her husband had never mentioned in the name, at home, as it runs.
She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.
Rohini is telling:
My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at an end.
Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.
Rohini started her first Discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.
Many women had never heard the word "patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.
At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.
After the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise.
Rohini asked any participant in telling the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, lovingly and so on.
Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, that they don't respect us?
Should it not be equivalent? "
"some of these women have been married since 30 years, and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Breeding of a centuries-old tradition, in which she married women the name of their husbands.
Rohini is telling:
A woman was so shy that she was going astray during the whole practice; another distray decided to allow the entire fruitless frustration against him and his family to curse him.
The expression on their faces was ecstatic.
I think I will never forget it again.
Still in adrenaline of adrenaline, having broken with an ancient breach, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.
And they kept their word.
In the coming days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.
The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife could not cease to say his name.
Another club member decided to do it at supper before the whole family.
She was afraid as her mother-in-law, she was afraid, saying that it was an error.
Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."
A husband of a participant in terms of less understandable and the situation took place in violence.
Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the sucking of the cnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:
Why do only women have to show that they are married?
I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinok-red dot if he would like it too.
He laughed only and I heard thereon to bear him.
The other women didn't stop completely with it, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days.
For many women the Discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.
"we do a trip with each Discussion club.
Normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.
I don't want to worry about who could listen to what could hear, "she says.
During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their lives, their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang talking about things which they had never made thought before.
Rohini says:
I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I have also made known about some things, for example, as our identities linked to our husbands, never spoken as honest.
It feels great to say some things out loud, no matter how small they occur.
In a discussion round, we talk about the concept of honour and, as it is connected to clothing.
Some women in the group have only bore saris since their marriage.
For most of them this is okay, but some wanted a sage-Kurta, a wide shirt above a trousers, they did not have a weed.
After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of its own coat election, morals associated with Saris and much more, dingggelte Rohini their own couple Kurtas (upper inhibitor) into a discussion round, so that women could carry them.
Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create.
On the question, whether in the five months have already changed a bit, Rohini confirms that things come slowly in the roles:
We have only made small steps until now.
Some women tried it a couple of times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.
Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.
Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at their foreheads.
The women in discussion lub know that changes they would like in their life - like the feiling around more freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.
As they give each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.
How Rohini explains:
Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.
I am also here.
But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.
And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if any woman walks in the club to home and other people tell about what we are talking about and what we do.
We are all sitting in the same boat.
The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories, which is not reported.
These stories are "news of those who experience themselves" and offer a hyperlocal context to report about global human rights and development claims.

A new system of kidnapping people for dealers, presumably for superbelieving purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province of Mozambique. the local government has now called a number of operations into life to stop the practitioners.
At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milcah, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.
One of the victims was decapitated and a part of the organs were taken from.
Two men were arrested and subsequently used to be the organs of Shaman in Tanzania and Malawi.
It give the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man's gold beheaded or wealth, declared the Police Terror of Zambézia of the BBC.
It is the first time that successive attacks were registered on smooth men in Mozambique.
Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes are people with albinism.
This led to the fact that the UN 2016 introduced a mission to investigate these practices.
The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania, where the government started to fight these superstitions and prejudices.
Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.
He warned those who propose to travel to the country:
Attention to kahle men who are travelling according to Mozambique are the goal of Muslim attacks, warned the Muslim police according to the latest assassination of three keystone men due to their body parts.
Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milcah, where the assassinations were arrested, arrested.
Hussene Algy Adamo, student and inhabitants of the town of Inhamburger in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already stated:
PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the faithful men.
The persecution and murder of smooth individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morphbala, province of Zambézia (PRM), who also claims that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head would have power to protect the riches.
In the last days, three men with hair failures were murdered in this part of the country.
Angela Ferreira Samantha parted the chronicle of the bloggers arms Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Mozambique is faced:
I would like GERNE EIN Mosambitious, THAT SICH is ashamed to offer a country in which the teacher would be ashamed to spend sex against good notes, and in which the teacher would take care of having their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor kahle or smooth-member for superbelieving purposes or "black magic." they aim to aim to get to rapid wealth.
In spite of the sincerity of the phenomena, some of the chance of makabren humor did not miss.
Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique, tweaked that both the head of the district Morrumour, Pedro Sapange, as well as the police preacher zzézias, Inácio Dina, both of both glances are:
Mosaic authorities are very worried about the murdered victims of believing people.

Free Bassel: NeedUnder Serious threat, December 2012 (in English) New n reactions of international community for medical Nobel Laureates and Dissident Liu Xiaobo
A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.
This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.
The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.
The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo had passed in international community attention after his lawyer ended at the end of June, that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.
In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (State of State) after being involved in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Lius case as "an internal matter," he says it as "not required to discuss this matter with any other country."
Yet, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, permit to vacate or allow a treatment abroad.
While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad.
United Nations
Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.
A speaker, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should have pressure to provide a treatment abroad within Liu.
Norway
Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius's release.
The relationship between China and Norway went into the Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government believes that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.
Diplomatic relations have only continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to relocate the salmon trip to China, as the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.
After the news spread, Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release to an expression and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.
Because of his detention he was not able to meet his prize.
During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.
European Union
On 6 July the European Parliament passed a decision where China was prompted to free his wife's arrest, Liu and his wife were promptly free from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants.
The top diplomatic platinum of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as they were in a statement on 30 June:
At the same time, we expect to raise all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.
They should meet all visits and receive them, which they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.
USA
Us-Ambassador Terry Branstad told that Americans have "him that he has the possibility for the treatment abroad, as far as it would help him in his satisfaction."
A spokesperson for US Embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced that the message was informing the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities not only Liu, but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia from their house arrest.
The US Embassy in China drew a furious response from China to itself, with the exterior of the State Department that "no country has the right to participate in and irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."
Polley told that China should offer the following:
Protecting and freedom such as travel tips and access to medical care of its choice, which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.
The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkel and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to impose the Chinese government to impose Liu and his wife unconditionally.
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, so that he could not enter into proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo
Germany
On July 3, Berlin, the German government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."
The Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
Previously, diplomatic sources reported to Beijing's news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex by Liu could visit the visit to Hamburg.
Canada
On 28 June, Canadian ambassador John McCallum requested China to provide an appropriate medical care at providing a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to give himself up of his family.
Lius lawyer told him that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to meet Liu, with someone outside, including his attorneys, to speak and contact.
McCallum tells us further:
Canada is calling for China to maintain its international human rights issues, including freedom of expression, to preserve the rights of this rights.
France
France's State Department urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons:
All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family can have contact with him.
Although the news of France information already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, there was no further information published whether France will eventually receive him.
Taiwan
The Council of Russia in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release Liu and establish a major tolerance to those who want to use peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development.
In China, the Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progress Party called on China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.
Dalai Lama
The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in an explanation on 28 June at Liu's very worried and suggested that many have asked him to pray for Lius Wellbeing.
He said about Liu:
It is my faith that he took the initiatives that he took and for which he had been ripenalised to a harmonious, stable and wealthy China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.
I felt personally very moving and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.
Singapore: city or country?
Singapore.

Is Singapore a city or country?
The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.
But according to Justice Minister, K. Shancourgam should be considered a city in Singapore.
This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.
During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Polish Association of the State of New York, the Minister observed that many people criticise the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries.
He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...
This is what most people go an error.
I have tried to explain that we are different.
We are a city.
We are not a country.
"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to turn" "" "the logic" "", "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""
And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, you can say that we don't have any country.
It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities, a must-hurt.
Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?
The reasons carried out by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared unintentional undemocratic.
In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities which will permanently be led by a party.
These cities are democratic.
As soon as you reach the subject of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritative character will return to the present democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.
In the end, the last week of Shancourgam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial coative, our political system really non-answers.
Corresponding questions asked him with non-answers of rational manner.
Rachel Zeng invites Shancourgam to clear his opinion, since she didn't understand this conclusion.
Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.
When Singapore is not a country but a city is, so what country is ours...
In short, I don't understand anything.
I would be very grateful if our werter K Shancourgam would take the effort to clarify this point where he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.
By announcing his comment on the blog, he comments concerning the critics that you should start to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that you can understand the context of the statements of Shancourgam better, according to that Singapore is a city and no country.
Read the inscription.
When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" as a country, "he stated why the elections in Singapore were so unimportant, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections.
He performs Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).
When he said that Singapore was no country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!
Clement Tan illustrates his disappointment of Shancourgam, who is a leader of a growing generation that makes such polemical statement.
I am about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said, very embarrassed...
At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which expected me - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.
But with K. Shancourgam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even certain if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defended.
The Temasek Review covers the vulnerability of Shanmugams Arguments:
Does Mr. Shancourgam "committed a mistake" or was it a frivolous publisher?
When Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state?
If not, what country will the sovereign rights of the City of Singapore go back?
Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.
Because he plays an important role inside the Governmental hospital, the statements made by Mr. Shancourgam are the importance of serious importance.
Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?
Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?
What is the value of our pink identity card?
Are we citizens of a land or the inhabitants of a city?
In addition, the magazine Journey of a Decade applies to the event, Singapore and was always a city:
"I didn't say what I said..."
This proposition seems to have heard many of the people of Singapur...
No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.
We were always a city.
We have always been a city / island nation.
I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defence of the land above all" etc., but that's not quite true.
We should rather speak of the defense of the city.
The Myth of the "cute Canadian"
Canadian Ned Flanders.
Screenshot aus a YouTube video.
Global Voices said before short, his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect at your habitation or homeland?
Your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors about certain parts of the world, and a different facet shall be shown.
The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, which lives in Canada and Japan.
The question posed by me in Japan is: "are you an American?"
"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I am saying," "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and back in Japan." ""
Depending on what situation takes place the conversation, it is considered courteous to show interest in his conversational partner by asking personal questions.
In my clarification then the standard answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inside of anger, if they are held for Americans, but me do not disturb me.
For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans.
This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians offer a Canadian banner good at their backpack, if they are travelling.
All love Canadians.
Americans are... yet.
So it was, when I began travelling 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.
Canadians have always worn small chorus leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.
We have a free health care!
There are no weapons at us!
Gay marriage in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005!
All seem to think, Canada is so great.
We are polite.
We obviously say very often. "
Canada is also considered the tolerant country of ethnic groups.
We are not like those types south of the border.
We Canadians are nice.
I hate that.
First, I have many American friends I admire very much.
There would be nothing that would make me feel confused with Johnny from Dallas.
With Marc from Austin.
With Adam from San Francisco.
Or with Michael from Honolulu.
There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."
First of all: as "nice" means to be said, basically, to be spying - like the benevolent, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has one's own Canadian Doppelgänger).
If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.
There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can encounter.
Harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting to make no attention.
This can be something good when you go unnoticed in the background, distant from the things that happen around one.
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a major stake in Canadians.
We tend to take care of our own matters.
Which accounts as "nice," maybe just cool politeness.
Canadians do not talk about the fence with the neighbours.
We lack the warm hearted, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.
Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just 'nice'. our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.
Music video of a pop band parodic Thailands Junta
One in Thailand's famous pop band has published a music video that the junta parody, which took power in 2014, and despite their promises to restore civilian government, the country continues to reigns.
The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what rules make his girlfriend.
Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the persistent military dominance of the Junta.
The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country's situation.
The video about the song was a huge success.
Within the first three days the video was uploaded to Facebook only 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.
Last month Charlie Chaplin-Video "has been blocked the dictator" in Thailand after a group of activists trained the public to watch this video.
The video can be interpreted as a creative and playful introduction to Thai politics, especially as it acts with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.
Have a look at these images of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been traced in the past three years.
The "44 rules of the girls" refers to the draconical section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which is the commander-in-chief of the host's absolute decision on important national issues.
The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program on the infamous program of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered by the Junta as a critic.
The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to repaid activists and other critics of the state.
For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, which monitors online content and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy to have criminal prosecutions.
Thailand puts a strict companion against "Lese Majest" (Majesty).
On 20 May 2014, the War Law was proclaimed in Thailand.
Two days later it came to a coup of the army.
One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.
In the video, even as people will be thrown into a black vans, before you bring them into an intersection bearing, another problem fall.
Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they are supposed to have caused "confusion" in society and to make internet users a long term penalties, they should insult the monarchy.
Meanwhile, the teaser of the song members of the band, who was imitated from "Die Tribute of Panem" was already used by coup leaders during the protests in 2014.

The following article, written by Dmitri Stateynov, was first published on the website of OC Media and appears with friendly permission.
The post-war society has only recovered very slowly in East-East Asia, especially in Tkuarchal district.
It is now over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchasan War was officially ended, but his scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.
The abandoned villages of the Northern District in Tkuarchal shows distinctive images.
Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, polyana and Kharchilava are in the aquatic basin of Abchasien.
Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, parasies, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the area.
Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.
Today, the largest part of Russians and Abchases are living in the area.
These settlements are also known as the Catholic capitals in Abchasia.
In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people still lived here. today, there are only a few hundred people in these covites.
This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.
Since 2011, the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after a decade.
In 1989, approximately 43,000 people lived in this district.

"all this is a consequence of the war"
The empty five-storey building blocks from the Soviet Union from the early 60s, called Chruschchschukovkas, are symbolically for the decline and destruction of the region.
The buildings are falling and quite rare, they are inhabited by more than two families.

At the entrance of the village Dzhantukha I met a native older man.
He begins a conversation and it's difficult to finish this.
"" "" "" "all this is a consequence of the war." "" "" ""
"can I talk to you?" "why speak?
It is nevertheless clear. "
Before the war the village was full of life.
There were community centers, schools and kindergartens who served all the community.
Now there's only paved road with amazing splendor buildings.
The people who once lived at this place and made their contribution to the central plantation of the Soviet Union, have now left the district.
In the ghost town of Dzhantukha, about fifty inhabitants live.
About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages, it looks similar.
The Chruschchowkas, who still accommodate one or two families, recognize the balconies where laundry is dried.
Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.
When they discover the camera in their hand, they immediately withdraw.
"our mother has forbidden us to photograph us," says one of the girls.
"" "" "" "why?" "" "she simply banned us, that's all." "" "" ""
The girl whispers something and suddenly, they leave the demolished building and disappear.
Many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuarchalugol.
Families are also involved in the Subsistenzine (cultivation of agricultural products) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable cultivation.
It is difficult to come over the laps.
The district administration delivers candles in winter free of charge and bread on the villages.

"I don't know what will happen, but we will build courgettes"
Some ten years ago, an older woman moved with the name Galina (or Tante Galya, as it is called in the neighborhood) from Akarmara to Jazhantukha.
In spite of her eldest daughter who lives in France, Galina has not left Abchasium to live with her. "my heart will remain forever in Ababa," she tells.
Galina doesn't want to accept financial assistance from her daughter and insisted that she supported her young grandchildren instead.
Galinas monthly rents are just nine dollars.
"" "" "" "if you have neither a vegetable garden or a house, it's very hard to survive," "" "she gives." ""
Tante Galya tells us that they and other villagers try to meet regularly and holidays together.

"a 90-year-old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building.
When holidays are, we visit us.
But we can't do that - everybody is busy with his own problems. "
While she tells her story, a younger neighbour appears on the balcony.
"" "" "" "Natascha," "" "calls Tant Galya." "" "they said we could build courgettes." ""
I have already prepared the ground.
I don't know what will happen, but we will build courgettes. "
"you can get used to everything"
Galyas conversationalist Natascha worked together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for some time.
Natascha was 11 years old when the war began.
Every day, she remembers the village in front of the war.
Despite the relatives who live in Central Ukraine, Ossetia and Georgia (the country of Abchasia simply departed), they did not have the opportunity to leave.

"we recently bought land in Sukhumi (administration building in Abchasien).
We want to build a house there, but that will take something else, "she explains.
Natasha received approximately $9 child money for each child.
Her husband works in the Kohlengrube.
The young family has its own farm.
In the proximity of the house where Natasha kindergartens once was, they hold pigs, cows, hops and chickens.
It tells us that there was a very frightening situation initially, when many people left the village after the war.
But during the time she lost her fears.

"we don't be afraid of the dark street or the few people.
You can get used to everything.
Many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war.
But in fact, it was rather something to do with looting.
After the war there were hardly any work, and everyone lived quite as it was right.
"" "I remember every day as the city and the war were once." "" "" ""
When our conversation flowed, a little boy goes over to us.
It runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden.
A ball flies out of the window and another boy chases him.
He plays with the ball, then rolling the hills.
One group of children is now watching the ball.
While they run, some of them throw stones to the falling buildings.
These ruins are part of her childhood, who care for uncertainty in their lives.
They don't know it differently.

In Mexico, "Mama Africa" houses migrants on their long journey
Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.

This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears with friendly permission.
On the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.
It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.
It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral pink Brillencer and gold-colored ear-rings in teddy bear shape.
She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Braachula and grew up there. yet, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.
This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) become an destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.
The hotel has rather no charm.
For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with ground-grinding, crumble walls and beds made of metal.
In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.
There is no sign to the hotel - yet, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.
Sometimes, Frau Ramírez, people are coming into full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!
Where are you Mama Africa? "
At the moment it's rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez received 200 guests at the same time.
There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sitting outside on cardboard.
She doesn't want to reject anybody.
She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay them, they massaged them with a balm that drew from the long journey.
Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time ago.
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.
The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurstache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.
The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.
Photo: Amy Bracken.
"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""
Very loving.
She has the cordiality of a mother...
We feel very comfortable here. "
Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.
They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States, to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.
The family had heard of other directions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.
He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans speak already on WhatsApp from Mrs. Ramírez.
As many of its companion managers, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker for building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.
When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.
He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.
"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answers. "we will always stay in touch."
Mrs. Ramírez tells us that her guests are sending her often text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.
She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.
They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chicken to prepare chicken as in Ghana.
Ms. Ramírez may be very well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.
In the other end of the city, a cul-gasse road leads to Jesús Valenela.
In this winter, Valencia and his family are included in their little house.
He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants can be sold too expensive.
He started trying to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.
At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.
Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and cooking outside.
Valenciela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.
"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.
I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered.
There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "
After he lived for three years, he was moved out of the United States after a raid on his job.
The majority of migrants who travels through Tapia comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.
José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.
In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an alluating, offered him a roof.
A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.
Back to the home of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.
In the gears, travellers consult their telephones quiet.
A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority from Somalia.
Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.
Like a proud Grandmother she blames her album with many photos.
There are one of her daughter with African hair-spots that you have made a demonstration, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, young and old.
She laughs sad while she introduces them briefly.
"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have already gone."
China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.
A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, marching and marching.
The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.
On 10 July, the cell phone users received a mobile phone message in the Tianshan district of Urumqi a cell phone, where they address the District government, to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").
"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "to hinder access to terrorist information." "" "" ""
However, the authorities trusted the app for more than combating terrorism.
According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app before they had replaced the app with a private WeChat group.
"" "in the communication of the police, the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes by the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "" "" activities and "" "" harmful information "" "" including videos, images, books and documents. "" "
Jingwanders website describes the app as follows:
Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.
The main function is the blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users attentive to them how much time they spend online, and to remote control the own home network.
This app with the filters for minors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.
An app with these functions can be used naturally in a variety of ways.
For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers are able to manipulate or steal home network of a person.
This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.
While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, forced ethnic minority interests such as Xinjiang and Tibet.
To limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme interest and monitoring measures, as well as routinemized Internet.
"" "the media-based media outlet" Images from Mainland China "" "" ("" "" Eastern Europe "" ""), published by local news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police officers had indiscriminated the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the monitoring app. "" "
The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.
A mobile notification demanded that the app will install the app within 10 days.
If you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.
This is a setback for technological development.
They forced the people to use equipment which are intended for older people.
This is a form of captivity by the surveillance technology.
We are back to Maos China again.
"" "" "" "images from Mainland China" "" "(" "" "Eastern Europe" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and therefore get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""
After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones are integrated into Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.
The rules in Jingwang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city-party council which minimize illegal content.
All government agencies, agencies, and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions from Cybersecurity Office to follow their computers and communication equipment.
A recent report by Freedom House, a U.S. human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:
In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a decree establishing all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media-memory cards" at the local police.
The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy this action. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible clubs, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.
Sleep or death, part 1: everything cries after death

This is the first of six reports in the series "sleep or death," in which the activity is Sarmad Al Jilane described his experience in a Syrian prison.
Far away from our blue, virtual world you look at yourself and specify that you are all alone in one place where everything has disappeared.
Everything has emerged after and after disbanded and revealing a truth that is clearly identifiable, both from inside and outside.
One that makes her name all the glory.
One that is defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.
But if you pick the reality again and look behind the scenes - beyond the actors, beautiful scenes and performers - transform themselves the characters in essence of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.
All doubt solve yourself in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even though the Earth are caught on the axis of ignorance. you know that you are caught between walls, your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone.
"" "they have arrested me and my father thrice, but that wasn't enough for me to formulate" "" "my lesson," "" "as the head of security services it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure." ""
He put his power on us under evidence, as he even destroyed the simplest concepts we knew.
Five young people were killed during a peaceful protest like darnel from the beautiful garden of our revolution.
"" "it sufficed to make the city the darkness of the night with" "" "Allahu akbar" "" "scream." ""
All the districts coveted, but not my own.
For the first time it was silent, raining, at the wrong time, even if I found no high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security and its complice.
During the third night the things had calmed down, after the power supply was stopped in the neighbourhood.
I broke the silence, by crying out several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house.
I heard my voice contradily through the silence.
A few minutes later, some of my friends were courageous enough to meet together.
I was not alone.
Many friends, true friends closed to me; we joined us in a splendid picture, full of my expectations and fully fulfilled.
At such a moment you are aware that you delivered the spirit out of the lamp, but it is simply interested in the barley.
I received a call from my father: "ready to meet you, we meet at the military safety office."
He was laid up.
Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice, after you have done it all the way until the office of security from the body.
I arrived there.
The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I now also.
"" "the Colonel Ghassan starts to say:" "" "let me hear as you are" "" "Allahu Akbar" "" "or you are only brave enough to scream, if we are not nearby." "" "" ""
His asserted eyes were on me.
"" "" "" "and you dream what to look at me in the eyes, not to the ground!" "" "" ""
What I did then did nothing to do with courage.
I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.
Perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps at the revolution.
I was so sure of my business when I answered: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.
"" "and I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes, so why should I do it now?" "" "" ""
It was the shortest entertainment, which could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret my word from what I said.
"" "" "" "he is in solitary and his father equal with that." "" "" ""
"he is equal to his father."
The contingank of this curse lies between me and now in the nose.
He became a "syndrome," a seelic torture that I was exposed to months.
I cry to the yard.
In the first office, I leave everything I carry with me.
Afterwards through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a gear to the individual cells.
I consider all the details exactly before I enter the room.
Otherwise, they have probably assigned a larger cell to me this time.
I have to share it with only one another prisoner, and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission.
After a couple of minutes, who felt like a whole life, the civil servants left the cell, and I attacked on a well-known communication method: to strike your fist against the wall.
I learned that my cell comrade was a "adult detainling."
After long hesitating he answered me.
Apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a well-respected male, who sees me similar and "the doctor."
In the perfect darkness, there are no distinctive facial features, and doctors do not exist here; we are all only numbers.
"perhaps someone, whose voice looks like me?"
All answers are linked to its existence.
Perhaps he was moved into one of the great cells.
Perhaps he will be interrogated immediately.
The investigator had assured me, they would release him if I stay.
Liars.
I would have liked to have a scarecrow, to drive all these crows that labs up in the fruit of my head.
From the distance I still listened to "Allahu Akbar" to scream.
It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always around these time the screaming, every day.
The door opens.
I was always convinced that black the color of the destroyer is, until I saw the yellow light, which presented us the gray in person: the Raad (about: "thunder," Angolan on 13th Sure of the Koran).
"" "" "" "they are here to hear." "" "" ""
So the secret is out: to protect the state security in front of us and prevent the terrorists and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their denominational replacement map and betrayed the close eye view of her world view.
This is not a house, which is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to turn the criminals of their clans into a hero.
I cared for the interrogation and meet to Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least, he looks like this.
He starts a "pleasant" conversation, despite the facial expressions that replict him: "my boy, you are still young, you can begin to join this daytime and protest on demonstrations, which will soon be able to find an end."
I didn't answer.
I used to get used to answer.
I can really no longer tell when insults and strokes after a friendly conversation has become a normal communication tool.
When and how that happened was insignificant.
Some voice in me said that I had to accustomed me to be punished, although I had done nothing to earn this sentence.
Punishment in all their diversity.
His command is to rip me as much flesh as possible from the body.
"" "he calls the" "" "confession" "". "" ""
It begins with a plastic pipe, which probably dates from the cloak.
Your Henker takes you at your screaming.
Give him a pleasure, you can not measure you with him, and you cannot withhold your cry.
My cry fell not enough to him, so they pressed the tube through a cable.
During my first arrest, I asked whether the investigators had worked as a garbage collector earlier or whether that belonged to normal working equipment.
They had four cables interwoven together to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.
Within a single hour, three of them changed while I was still on the line.
I had lost all my feeling in my body - and my voice, why I heard it to cry out.
The Henker noticed the cooling, and found no favour at all, why he was next to a electrically charged staff.
Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood.
My seminaked body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect streamers.
The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.
After two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night.
This must have been around midnight.
I decided to put my sleep again; let's say that it was my only option.
A few hours forgetting, that came to me as minutes.
Then the call for the morning prayer.
The door opens and the dawn fills the space ".Raus with you, Arschficker."
I reply with the voice of an exhaustive youth: "my Lord, my father must make himself terrifying."
"be quiet and walk away, you'll be moved."
That was new.
Otherwise they were always released.
Where to run me?!
The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance
Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.
The photograph was taken by aman Madan, the original author of this text.
Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he smiles at his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch.
However, on what you can rely on, a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine-stained lips can be discovered.
He lives in the top of his family house that belonged to them since 1967; the year where Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).
For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist, the conservative majority recieved and their old-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapesmusic.
With his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Refugee. all these issues can not only be found in its home town of Amman, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria through to Sanaa in Yemen.
With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can join the people who have suffered the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.
Even if he does not open it, he appealed against the American foreign policy.
Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.
Recorded by the author.
Hdaib doesn't believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian Refugee in the second generation - so he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far.
"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," Hdaib stresses.
Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man, while he poured into two cups in water. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.
The Jordanian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.
Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senumerable boy has little to do with a protest against Islam.
Basically, the cups of a warm coffee and the shame of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.
Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free sky, especially if one accuses a view into neighbouring countries.
Therefore, one avoids basic things to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not to land.
Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has canceled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.
Some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Act - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed Sinno, which contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tabby.
The MP and former spokeswoman for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been "just" because of the sexual orientation of the Sangman.
Many also claim that commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which inquery the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.
In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian nation as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to deploy "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."
This statement is probably not simply being silly rhetoric, but actually a clearly evident-crystallized reality reflected in Jordan, which appears clear in Hdaibs plant.
In 2016, Hdaib made traditional Sexually-ternormen to marry his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have voorhelichen sex.
The picture shows the skeleton of a evidenounced wife whose arms and legs are stretched to the corners of the canvas.
It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trusted.
Over the past years, the number of 'honorary de' has risen in Jordan - the unofficial outside.
Human Rights Watch: according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Citizen reached its peak in 2016; however, it has still been added that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women, victims, attempted murder or domestic violence.
According to a law prohibiting a law from the year 1954, women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence, "and for their release is often a lonely bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen.
Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, not to be afraid of themes in his country long as taboos.
Hdaib denies that his work is politically, is being aware that he is his music, which is full of explicit attack on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot separate from politics.
"I come from the Middle East, man.
I was told of politics, "he says.
In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity in the attack.
In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.
The list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued.
In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."
In this song a verse is repeated often:
"you are free, and everyone else is it."
In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.
He noticed that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still strong in 2014.
In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanic online program Roya, to note later that his comments were torn from context, twisted and had been censored.
"at Youtube, it was uploaded without a cuts, but it was only a revised version," he says.
Today, Hdaib pays open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance about homosexuals do not speak to Islam.
He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.
Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do this not?
The real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.
In the hashemian realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced.
Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they expressed themselves on comments in social media critically crucial to the problems, associated with the deeply rooted corruption.
In view of this, the concert Hdaibs is said that only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.
For him, progress is a permanent link and take it. Jordan has now revered for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees itself Hdaib - consists of slow, need and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.
In the end, Hdaib dreamt such as millions of other Arabs also, from a Arab world without interventions abroad.
He is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience "them."
Perhaps the region is supported by music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, scattering unitions, and artificial way.
Until the time is, Hdaib will continue to continue and also resist resistance.

Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.
These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!
There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.
It is believed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the drums, and dancing over more than one thousand years have come across and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region.
We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.
We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.
You can imagine how big these parts are...
A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal.
I've been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two buggy eyes are straight ahead.
However, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival has the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way in the summer:
"Yattemare!
Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.
I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.
The view of a 18-metre tall fixed car was unbelievable.
Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!
Young Peruvians swap weapons against scissors and shaving

Seldom were external appearance and body care so important as in this story, because they are helping to keep away the Peruvian youth from crime, and promote a legitimate profession like the hairstyle.
El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug dealers are all daily.
A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe.
At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.
The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hair styles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), and Neymar (Brazil) has led to provide more normalities in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these elaborate hairdressers.
The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, even an annual event inspired, the competition of hairstyle "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.
There are experts to show each other, to show who can see the exact Looks out of them, as you can see in the following video (see additional videos on current competitor) on the public Facebook profile (Batalla de Barberos).
Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against barber tools and place them instead of bad advice on hairdresser's clothing that enables them to find work.
Motivated by this activity and offering, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.
The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year early in March and reported on some of their successes:
In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because of love to the children we have built this educational community.
Colombia: letter of love to guerilla fighters
Photo: Valentina Monsalve.
Use with friendly permission.
"" "the following article is the revised version of the" "" "Liebesmessages" "" "guerrillas" "", "which publishes the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""
The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.
Why do we only write love letters to people we know?
Isn't it a lot more important, people that feel extinct, affection to common?
This question came to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young-Youth Foundation by the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) who encouraged young people to write guerrillas.
Only recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.
International was the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.
However, before columnist, however, there is a long way until you can talk about an effective reconciliation and peace.
Guerrillatroopers, who lived for many years in illegal camps, have been subjected to military rhetoric, and around the clock carried their weapons in themselves, now they have to integrate into life as civilians.
In turn, the Colombian society, in turn, struggled to life in constant fear and in some cases deepened hatred against guerilla fighters, must now record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.
Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnist had to close together and would help the integration process.
And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages on former guerrilla fighting to welcome them back in society.
The campaign of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrillas who should then be handed to personally.
The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign
The idea for the letter was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureates that took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.
This declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more necessary.
He plane, he will continue to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent promise.
Thus, the plan, letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, now find their place in society and establish itself a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a joint history of peace."
To date, more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign.
The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.
'i have never thought that someone would forgive me '
The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.
A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogoti traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally.
The members of the FARC on how they had done earlier in order to counter the commands of their leader.
But this time they received no orders, but letters of substituting people from all over the country.
It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings to go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.
Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:
After we handed the letters to the letter, a former fighter was led by the guerrilla fighter.
When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.
I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed a MGL pomegranate, a lethal weapon in the thorn-Sleeping.
And I asked him, "Hello, what are they doing?" he said, "I reply to a letter that somebody has written."
It is a very nice and hopeful letter.
Never before in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "then suddenly tears of tears have walked on my cheeks.
I impoverished him, and sat down beside the pomegranate.
Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.
The man told me more about his life. he never expected something from life as war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine. "I never thought that someone would forgive myself for my fault.
But now I know that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms.
Till now, I have only learned how to handle weapons.
But now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "
New voices
For the start, students and some leaders of the FARC arrived in a discussion round.
The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.
Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced how to develop social injustice on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country more righteous.
For a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.
Manuela was impressed:
Those people who have never had seen hearing before and had no electoral law, and to recognise that people who were often seen as a monster, and hated even only people with beautiful feelings that were surrounded by their life's circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.
The reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me.
But it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug.
Many former fighters have answered the letters.
Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:
Columbianern was made aware that after the disarmament of peace would rule peace.
But that is not the case.
As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise to weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).
Now we use the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.
This is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war.
We give you our Word, make our contribution, and offer sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. to those who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming.
There will be many obstacles on our way, but we will overcome them.
A Transwoman talks about persecutions in Chechnya and the life before Kadyrow
A map of Chechnya, with surrounding autonomous regions and countries.

It follows the translation of an article published by our partner Aida Mirmakesowa and its first publication on the OC Media web site.
Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.
With terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.
But the threat, which is like a Damocleset on the right of LGBTQ-community, is not only created over night.
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual wife from Grozny, who shared some of her experience with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic.
The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines in several months ago, after reports were published, which were printed, torture and killing of queens in the Republic.
The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who took suspicious queens and raised them into secret prisons in Argun.
"you have brought a monster to the world"
Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.
She felt her childhood since her childhood, that she was a woman in reality.
When they grow up, it became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so that she moved to Moscow.
After a group of Tschetschens had experienced by gender equality, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.
For fear of her life she moved over to the United States.
Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.
One day told me that someone needed my help.
It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who put in trouble.
She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.
While I tried to help her, someone, of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"
After that the photos of my documents made the round about WhatsApp.
On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.
When I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a defect: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."
When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.
Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you still escape the family, you smuck?"
I didn't know the person.
I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.
Then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital.
Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.
The man fled.
The women had called a ambulance.
In the hospital I learned that I had two key abated in my right lung wings.
OC Media: in which ambulances you were laid - in the men or women?
Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor stood up and laid me in the women.
I am very grateful for this.
When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.
But he turned out to be a good man.
I am thankful for him that he is respectful with me.
I spent more than a month in the hospital.
Last February, I got threats.
They called me, they wrote - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.
That was the beginning of a nightmare.
My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.
The requested to send me to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.
They found absurd receivables: some said to me, I have to prove that I was upset up without the streets; others want I had not changed in the official television in Grozny, and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only evil, and Photoshop.
I have baskets size C - what should I say on television?
OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?
Sabrina: it's still hard for them.
Some older people said once to my mother on the road.
"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the entire Republic humiliated." ""
We can't touch you because you are a froous woman, but you must disappear from here. "
My mother became too much and she lay down a rope around his neck.
Fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them.
At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window was a car with darkened windshield and a plate plate with a 95.
After it was the third time it was clear to me that something lazy was lazy.
My human rights-friends checked the number of license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.
OC Media: how did you flee?
Sabrina: with the help of activists.
For safety reasons, I don't want to pay their names, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.
With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.
I can still not understand how it could be.
Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother, as soon as I arrived.
I bought it without record, without ID, without anything.
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.
Came and checked into the hotel.
The number was registered at a foreigner.
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.
At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe, you are in safety, just because you have left the country?
Our people already know in which hotel you stole. you even know your room number.
Only to prove it: it's the number 115. "
Can you imagine that?!
This was actually my room number.
OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?
Sabrina: with my mother and my sisters.
But we don't talk about gender equality, however, this is a table theme.
Some traditional Caucasian elements have I still wear in me.
So very I wish it too, this seelian barrier cannot be overcome.
I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.
When we chat with camera, I will actually give myself effort to look as the person remembers them from their past - so on my male form.
But that's very hard.
OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?
What do your friends do, those who have stayed?
Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.
For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.
I was talking to someone who gave a one and a half months in Argun.
He told that while Ramadan was not arrested and tortured during the Ramadan, but also that all of the Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.
Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.
So, my opinion, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood.
OC Media: are men still in this secret prisons now?
Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there would be no many.
If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to settle Kadyrows's judgment.
As far as I know, they are arrested there, so that you can present them as terrorists later.
Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base.
You understand?
As if these people were not simply disappeared, it seemed to be used specifically to radialize himself.
OC Media: is this now only a delay or do you have a source for this information?
Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.
He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after having grown beard.
There have been nothing new from them since.
They simply took them away.
And the so-called Lord, that person was even when these people were taken away.
However, until now they were not presented as a bandits, so far there were no reports. we suggest that such actions are quite possible.
Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?
Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already took place in the past?
Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.
In Chechnya, I had a Bob.
I think before 2003 I was already known around Grozny when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems.
Seriously!
Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.
On the contrary, it was much safer than now.
In Russia, Russia wanted to lead us to the "Civization," but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age.
OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?
Sabrina: my eyebrows were slipped; I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.
The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never changed a hair.
In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.
It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people came there.
We have never been insulted.
In the Chechen language there is an affection: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "carrot isn't about the misfortune of another."
People often say it often to children, if that are fun of sick.
OC Media: so they just kept their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?
Sabrina: yes.
They never offended me, never chased, and never smitten me.
OC Media: how long did this Gnadensage stay?
Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.
When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality on morals.
He didn't talk about us, but rather on the behaviour of women.
Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change.
Those who have landed and laughed before, looked at yourself with suspicion.
During the time I left Chechnya.
But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.
OC Media: what activity now you go to?
Sabrina: I work as a waitress.
I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US.
Apart from that, I'm still working as an activist.
At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.
I agree with them as a kind of psychologist.
We organize teacreffs, mergers, I meditate them to hospital and help them to get food cards.
I don't get a cent for that.
I have discovered these people myself, when I abdicated concessions.
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.
OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?
Sabrina: that's aligning.
So nature, that has purely nothing to do with religion.
This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth, that there is no momentary among them.
The Dagestans have who, the Cabardine have the ones, the Russians also have they; on the whole planet it does exist - but "not in Chechnya."
I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something.
I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.
Many of them - practicable Muslims who walk to the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.
Do you know, many think about transitions of men who love men, and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a deception.
These are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be precise, different living settings.
For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body.
Not whether I have a partner or not.
Sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.
And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.
Local groups campaigned to an increase of self-moral within the poor Arab Ahwazi community in Iran
The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.
There has been a strong increase of self-mordes since the last months.
The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.
Photo: use with permission.
The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, came the desperate situation of the Arabian Ahwazi community in Iran that is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.
Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.
He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to come up for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to remain in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.
A video played on YouTube, where he had lit the moments, after he had ignited himself.
Some people made it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the valley's suburban hospital in the city of Ahwaz.
According to local sources, the doctors were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.
He died a short time later.
It was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabian Ahwazi minority, and activists warned that more men could take life.
The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.
Their stories have a thing in common: there were all the family fathers that were helpless and incapable of getting their families to feed their families and pursue a secure work.
Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination
The region, in which a majority of the Arab Ahwazi community is located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihoods.
In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power, and 1925 great efforts made it to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.
In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the richest and valuable materials for Iranian agriculture.
Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy still develops slowly, and the native population receives only little of this wealth.
She is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivations.
The Iranian regime refused to systematically migrate workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.
The government also has built a number of tribes, the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounded.
These dams have only managed to manage the devastation of the region in the region, and to destroy local agriculture and palms and palms-industry.
The unemployment rate among the Arab Avozi-youngsters now rose to 81%.
Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have completed a university degree.
A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"
Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," a "high rise" of self-moral killers among young Ahwazi's men.
Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse, the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ahwaz, ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab Discrimination in the integration process:
Since functional and institutions do not prefers Arabic labour force, the local Arabian Ahwazi will have access to working opportunities in all sectors.
This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her living conditions outside your homeland Ahwaz.
There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their affiliation to the ancestor so that even Arab names will not be tolerated in the workplace, because speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.
Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, beat human rights activists before the situation is explosive.
It remains to wait, whether the world wakes up and knowledge of it.
The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.
Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.

"" "" "" "why not I identify with feminism, also with the intersectionality" "" "" ""
Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.
The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.
You can read in the comments below the original text.
When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustrations.
They are wondering why I am not part of the movement.
They even thought good scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist, and why we generally, all feminists should be within.
For example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education as men.
That women are still under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.
Violence against women is a global epidemic.
Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various sectors of life have stumbled upon a glass blanket, and that discrimination based on gender are still crosswise through the many different countries and beliefs.
All this is conscious and known.
I am convinced that I suffer double and threefold among them.
I am a black woman.
And yet, if I come to skin color, on racism, on black sorrel women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTI community, or on black women in the LGBT community; if I mention, on which way we have been physically, seelically and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists did not decide to mention many white feminists.
Yet, however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to emptied their voices, and to sing 'Kumbaya, to sing my lord' to obtain equality (some) of women.
But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, a institutional form of racist motivated violence, which we have been suspended black women in two times.
Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin are less of earn less than white men and women.
The fact that black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are more often referred to the school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.
Or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.
On the one hand, I want to have all men, all males and all human beings, either skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can take myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman likes to consider unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which relate to gender as well as on the skin color of a person.
I am exhausted and I'm not going to fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.
"" "Soil lamented in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a deserted and marginalised nature." ""
I'm refusing to join me groupings, which also absorb the customs of customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program.
I will no longer attempt to finalize the importance of skin color and sex. because some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revert them a better.
Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women more different gences and spread themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "Feminism" in its name.
I prefer to release myself full and entirely of feminism and called me of the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.
Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women on our own shows and give us in the spheres that are created for us.
Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book africa womanism: how we can defend ourselves, we can define ourselves on our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman.
Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately invoke separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.
In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.
I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman recognized as part of this paradigm.
I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life neither passed, nor ignored, is still rejected.
Paddeling against pollution: the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
This article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine, which reports unspecial about international efforts to solve environmental problems.
Within the context of an content-sharing agreement, this article is again published again.
Over the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or canoe - with a special concerns through the Kurdistan Regional Region. its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.
In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa that explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its community.
"I wanted to do something for the river, which we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells.
Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.
Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is involved in protecting and supporting the rivers, streams and water paths in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "
At the end of the video Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we don't have any water, how would we survive?"
This video was filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq's documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist.
The focus of their work lies on persecuted, slightly larger subcultures and is characterised by using cooperative photography and new multimedia techniques, with their help suppressed communities that can tell their stories by their own way.

The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weireinefoot) who is reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.
Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.
A police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex partner who had become violent.
Since the end of their relationship had been some time, and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.
As a further woman Balbuena was given because of failure, the Ada Báez did not use nothing.
A few days later, the second woman moved her ad back.
The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.
If women should see at all, in general, they do not receive support from the State.
In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities.
Intuition and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system which does not substrate 3-of-the laws: good approach, deficient realization and statistics
It is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even prove the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.
However, these figures are alarming.
In 2015, for domestic violence, the Office Attorney of 9600 admits to domestic violence. at 70% of them it went to violence against women.
86% of advertisements in the police came from women.
There were more than 5000 ads of domestic violence because of domestic violence. 86% of ads came from women here.
In the advertisements 40% of women said they were physically abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.
However, this statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.
According to the paraguayan women of female Ana Baiardi there are only few of these crimes actually displayed. "on each woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women will not do this.
"" "" "" "in any woman who imburse because of physical abuse, two women, who do not do this," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""
Since women's murder in Paraguay is no separate offense, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented, as many women will be murdered each year from their current or former partners.
By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.
The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay was documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.
According to its estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent actions by men.

Invisible abuse and an legal system that doesn't undertake anything
Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.
At the beginning she didn't want it, but then, after that, it was supposed to be regretted for ever.
Today, Mariana 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she endured the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:
I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.
When I read earlier this, I always thought that this only happens to be submissive, because they deceive of violent men.
I was convinced that I would never happen.
Mariana used social media to report about the abuses by Carlos Vera.
Without names, she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he isolated it.
Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.
Other Facebook users asked Mariana that they had fallen the so long of Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.
It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuses at least have a certain complicity in it.
Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner harassed them abuse.
Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO ("I believe you,") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuses.
In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.
They do what many others do not: they take the testimony of women seriously.
In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.
Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.
Then he began to beat them.
Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without any outcome and also from their relatives, they received no support.
It led a process against its former partner who developed into an inconsistent legal battle between Paraguay and their home country, in which it went mainly to money, power, and the influence of their former partner.
Shays laws: good approach, lack of implementation
"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very well, but not applied.
The admissions of abuses is a way full of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.
Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems with the use of the laws in the country.
On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürth).
This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nonone Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.
The original design of the law sees to explain the feminid to an independent crime-continuance and punish harder as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.
So the legislature was changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that they were afraid that the way for the decriminalization of abortions may be banned, which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.
The initial bill was planned, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, which have to carry the victims of violence themselves, if they simply want to receive only ad and receive a safe accommodation to expose the state.
Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:
In Paraguay, abuse are seen as part of human relationships.
Here, a change must take place, so violence should not be regarded as a little later.
Those who are silent in view of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to that the perpetrators are gone out.
We must restore so long, until misuse is no longer valid.
On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified, however, among other things, a passage that was called for partners in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.
The opinions about the changes go apart.
The section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victims.
The submission of the words "gender", "political force" and "sexual harassment" of parts of the law, however, is regarded as a large blow.
This article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weireinefoot) who is reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.
Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.
In Oman, independent media in Oman exposed to ban on a paper attacks
"this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Secretary" on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.
More than a year ago, the Peruvian authorities closed an independent Arab-language daily Azamn because of its reporting on corruption in the Sultant.
Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues in prison where he served a year sentence.
Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and taken before the Court, however, was later released.
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Saïd who came to power after he had set his father, Said ibn Taimur, who had revolted with a coup.
Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Chief of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.
The sultans of the Sultans is characterized by the harassal efforts of security forces, in particular the domestic intelligence, public freedoms, including press freedom, inadrenders and human rights activists, independent journalists, bloggers and more activists, intimidate and incarcerate.
The authorities reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights a systematic and hinder citizens, also activists, remember to express their views on the public matters of the country like corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline.
The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closing and detention three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.
Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.
On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari won an article entitled "High-level parties holding hands of justice" in the newspaper on July 26, 2016. in this case there was corruption in the Judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.
In the report, government officials accused of raising the Supreme Court of Justice in Oman, to raise a verdict in an inheritance.
Issue of the Azamn Zeitung, July 26, 2016 with a report on the title page with the title: "high-ranking parties holding hands on the judiciary."

On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, Member of the Committee of Directors, was charged by the ISS prior to the Special Department and was arrested in his arrival by the security forces.
On 9 August 2016, the ISS took the deputy chief editor of Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as chief editor after Al-Maamaris.
The paper was closed on an indefinite period after the information minister had given the statement that "the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way, including online, as of August 9, 2016."
On 26 September 2016 the trial in Maskat took place the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.
The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered final closure of the newspaper.
Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disturbance of the public order, "abuse of the internet" and "subexcavation of the state".
Al-Haj was found guilty of infringement of an audience and slander.
Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a unanimous prohibition against the two journalists was rejected.
Al-Abri was sentenced to one year prison and a fine of 1,000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after being found to use the use of an information network to spread the material that could pose a risk for public order. "
For Al-Abri, a bail was set in the amount of 5,000 omanic Rial (13000 US dollars) and he was released in prison on 22 August 2016.
The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, and Al-Haj condemned to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.
Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 in exile of his six months prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj still remains in prison, where he served his imprisonment.
The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Security Council to close the "Azamn newspaper."
Despite the decision of the court to allow Azamn again, the newspaper is subject to attacks by the Iranian government.
On 8 January, the Minister for Information received an order to extend the closure of "Azamn" by three months.
On 8 May 2017, the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister delivered another time against the decision of the Appeal Court, the publication of the paper.
The constant closure of Azamn and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman the press has been hurt.
For further injuries, for example, the closure of the independent journal Mowsatin and the exercising of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, include their operation.
Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the imprisoned journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the anomaly authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press freedom.
Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the British authorities to:
1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally released;
2. create a safe environment for the Azamn newspaper, so that their journalists may follow their work;
3. protect the Press freedom in the Land and
4. under all circumstances, human rights issues and journalists uninhibited their right human rights labour and without fear of retaliation, including grassent chicans.

Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misconceptions
Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is done with his understanding
Medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most critical needs of the continent.
There are two reasons for the need to be conducted on site medical research. there are two reasons for a lack in the offer of global health and vaccines that cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.
Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.
Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, is helping to establish its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.
Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).
He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.
He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.
As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he inquired about HIV-virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.
With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on misconceptions of media about this research.
(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).
Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?
Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.
In addition, I just stared a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.
Gv: what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?
How do they differ from those in Western countries?
RW: there are no basic research. we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere.
This must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver, instead of being Macher.
The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.
Gv: where does finance and support come from?
Is it sufficient?
How easy or difficult, to find appropriate scientists for the projects?
RW: from the USA and Europe.
The projects are supported differently.
It is difficult to find people who come back or move here, as financing and development chances are better in other countries.
Gv: how is the research infrastructure?
What obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you did not have before?
RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous power supply of electricity, water and internet.
Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.
Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?
RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.
Gv: how big is your opinion for the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support development?
RW: the potential is amazing.
I have seen great students of all ages.
There are need for special scientific training, starting at any age.
Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of the world, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them.
Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?
RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the lack access to scientific expertise that can be found here.
The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.
From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production
This entry of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solutions to environmental issues worldwide.
Frank Morton has been breeding the salad since the 1980 "s.
Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA-astronauts in space.
For almost 20 years, Morton's work was set only by its own accruby and the question as many salts of salts can be set.
But at the beginning of the 2000, he realized that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.
The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ripped leaves.
Over the past years, more such patents have been applied for ever more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trends, plant-breeders, environmental protectors and experts ensure food safety will ensure the future of food production.
As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton is still looking for a salad, but he still needs longer since its work continues to continue with more restrictions.
"" "" "" "it's like a rock broocks in a river, to whom I have to paddling." ""
So we must do this now, but it's a breach with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents have to go far too far.
And if they stand before the court, nobody can breed a new sage variety because all the characteristics are already patented. so he's doing so well as possible and tries to extract those features that he wants.
However, he is very careful and endeavoured to use a material that is protected as intellectual property.
"" "he also joined a movement that is increasingly bigger in the United States and throughout the world. open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeder)." ""
Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red Römersalat's variety of diving in the "glasshouse" of the station and it is being tested there if plants can be grown in space.

It is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.
The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.
It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and did not be protected as intellectual property and are usable for plant breeders permanently.
As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to use that others can freely use of them farmed seeds.
This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to buy businesses and sell it. "open source, breeder only allow others to breed their seed, to breed as their own varieties, and it will not immediately trigger two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many herbal patties.
Dozens of breeders and seeds have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.
Gloomy outlook
For the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection.
Seeds is according to him a role in larger clamity such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter not or only little to breed seed with natural resistance.
Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement did not deal with genetically modified plants.
All types of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, the most recent examples have to buy locally sourced vegetables, such as for example in peasant markets, should also know that the way is farmed as this vegetable is being bred.
Dietary sovereign without seed supremacy is not possible. "
The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to ensure other their seed remains free to provide. thus, in contrast, these are to be patented, seeds and plant characteristics.

Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available genpool is due to the increasingly abundant spiritual property rights in plant material, which is thus always restricted, unceasing.
Claire Luby, the director of Ossi, employed in her PhD work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all backotings are protected as intellectual property, making it either useless for plant-breeders either.
For other plants there are not yet some estimates, but experts like Luby suggests that mass-based plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented than salad or carrots.
A Question Of The Visials
Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - of such, by which their taste or their color improves up to such, because they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.
Opponents of patches on plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for breeders are declining by more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions are much worse than ever.
In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company established themselves for the preservation of genetic diversity.
However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property purchases other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varied innovations." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.
Often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result.
Such protection doesn't prevent innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "
Morton is looking for a different way to wait for another 20 years until a patent inflict, and certainly no innovation.
And if you have to wait so long for plants to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, we would have lost the battle.
But the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have been a generalized well, and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.
We want to make farmers' work easier.
That is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "
A total of Morton interferes in the concept to patented plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.
The plants form them, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that.
A secret of nature. "
For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of breeding breeding: "he who chases a variety, also breed its own values into them.
Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, are needed, are breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture.
"" "my concept is very gentry." "" "" ""
While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are) patents, it can survive the most smaller seed companies, either refuse to survive the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.
The independent plant-breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.

Morton is also the view that breeders would be ultra-innovative: "it looks as if I do with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.
I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ourselves, "he says." with a patent you can be protected for 20 years before competition, with which it simply makes it easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance
Although the USA seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.
In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a "open source" seed sector. the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.
It also supports them to come on "open source" seed and sell their own.
The German Organisation Agrecol works on an "open source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union.
(rules for the breaches differ from country to country, absent because the Ossi obligation is not simply being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)
In early November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventional farmed plants.
However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is necessary to implement the Member States, the Patent Office to implement these new line.
In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, in the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies across East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards patching seeds.
"" "Willy Douma, responsible for the" Open Source "" "" seed Systems "" "" program for Open Source "" "" seed Systems "" "," is currently building a worldwide alliance for "" "" Open Source "" "" for seed systems that will fall for the scheduled start next year. "" "
A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.
In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - represents the view that farmers have to come to seed, to exchange and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products.
In the report, the importance of a variety of food supplies with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a link by the Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will see him soon.
"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been considered, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role" "", "so Luby." "" "we are now trying to discover people that are more behind their food." "" "" ""

Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt
Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.
This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.
On the weekend of the 05.August the Egyptian government shut down the website of the Arabic network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported on this.
August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities were sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region.
The Arabic network for Human Rights Information lead - despite this attack and the remocking of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend their goal, so it was never so difficult as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not to admit our task. we hope to keep our task further.
ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera for "support of terrorism."
# Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web page bulations for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K
Besides the HRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnist and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.
Ziada took his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not available websites and media.
Now, the blog was established to circumvent the apparatus of the Egyptian government, the aim of an attack.
Blogger, the provider that is also home to Ziadas blog, is further accessible.
Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and took a video as the police raged physical violence against two students.
His articles are mainly about politics and human rights conditions in Egypt.
In a Facebook commentary, Ziada remarks on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:
The, blogs to unlock is very old, however, in the era of deldelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons for me:
1) It has succeeded to convey me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, preload of the national Security Council, the lock blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.
2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an impact if only a small audience.
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.
First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass censorship.
However, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.
The courageous go the way up to the end.
According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) open Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06. August 133 pages. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.
In addition, AFTE also documented the locking of providers to be possible through internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
AFTE reported in their research:
On Monday, June 12th we saw how to offer blocking of websites, VPNs, we began.
Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content, and filtering the content that they might have access to Egyptian users.
In addition, the situation is concealed in addition, that the cargo decisions are taken behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using them in front of the court against these actions.
Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government to go with censorship and whom will they attack next?
Is Rio de Janeiro in war?
The inhabitants argue.

Day for day report newspapers in Brazil, with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard illustrations.
Some of these headlines are as follows:
"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered," "" "thieves the pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force to Rio." ""
Violence in the middle of the crisis in the middle of the economic crisis and in a divided financial situation reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.
The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.
Reports like these have become everyday, and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.
"" "thus the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio known newspaper" "" "Extra" on August 16 the Editorial "" "" This is not normal, "" "" in which she announced, a new section called "" "" War in Rio "" "." "" "
All reports about violence in the city are now published there.
The motifs for their decision declared the newspaper so:
Extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexual break, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!
This is the only alternative so that we did not close our eyes in front of the cruelty.
In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor, announced that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure.
Extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't know war.
In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper declared that there are 843 countries following the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro in 843 countries.
In the Editorial the newspaper writes on:
We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, even though it can be used, grasp the police, which first shoot and then ask questions.
But we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.
Is the designation "War" more than it benefit?
In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues that the journalist Cecília Oliveira asserts the violence as the "war." this is their opinion on a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to take account by the police.
This is no war.
This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as in the analysis of the military approaches in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and an historical and self-counterfeit investment of public service.
Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.

Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, is false: "22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeastern part of the country. these are the latest available data.
No such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
"" "when we see the murder rate per state, Rio on No.16" "", "she writes." ""
Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, emphasises like Cecília, has repeatedly been repeating the state's security policy for years.
The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, belonged to a police unit whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police station and a unit permanently stationed there.
In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of nonviolent death. for several years, the UPP, however, according to several reports about the poor congregations and repression of the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit.
On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his article published in 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio not comply with the criteria for the name "civil war."
He writes:
In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws a serious consequences for the people after themselves.
Because this requires the state to use funds and ways that are typical for a war. this is the penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and an object for "collateralharm" and "distorted spheres."
War or her, is the fact that the inhabitants of Favelas in Rio continue to suffer.
A week ago, it is now that the police extinguish the mountain with the Favela Jacksonzinho, in order to assassinate the death of a police officer.
In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a orcharker died due to shots that fired the police from a helicopter.

To stay alive: learn Syrians, to plant mushrooms

Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime.
According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir ez and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.
The region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 is particularly affected by the lives of hundreds of civilians.
Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime.
Since 2013, those of rebels have been controlled areas outside Damascus under siege, what led to that inhabitants have been relied on locally or through tunnel and control points.
Traditional food products such as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.
A group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta as they can plant their own fungi as "life-saving food source."
They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.
Fungi do not belong to conventional, in Syria, they are extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, they are extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is extremely rare for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.
The head of the project, Nabil, said to the French News Agency AFP:
"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."
Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that had been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more. "
To collect money for the initiative, use in consultation with NGO Ghiras Alnear the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.
It is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge to the planting of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices.
At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12.700, but will continue to collect donations on CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.
The initiative is based on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity to 80%.
Because of the fuel shortages, fuel manufactured using plastic are used to supply the generators to supply the power supply.
Dr. Leila told global Voices that they began to test their quality from the regions of the region before they checked their quality and, if they are not suitable for consumption.
Afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a bowl. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on.
Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."
Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta.
Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.
"" "" "" "we want to teach people for various reasons" "" ": break of siege." ""
Providing a new food source on the market.
Dissemination of a culture of self-catering (such as paper, tea, coffee, cardboard, etc) are used for the extraction of new food.
Creating new jobs, especially for women working home.
Creating new jobs for people with disabilities, which are bound to their home.
"" "he said," "" "We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege is visible." ""

Portuguese MEP and justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
Several hundred people were protested on 21 October in many neighbourhoods in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramped in the north of Portugal in the week.
Forty-two people died, and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.
Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.
It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.
In June, in Pedrógão Grande was a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.
According to the European forestry surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, in Portugal alone, around 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.
So that you can make a better picture of Ernst the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.
Portugal is still burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata. (@ a _ ataner) October 15th, 2017
Some of Twitter-users shared images:
That is Braga tonight. # PrayForPortugal # Braga # FogosPT
Numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into the shops:
The foreseeable tragedy
The aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.
People asked themselves why the civil protection was unable to intervene to the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.
João Soveral provided by the federal government of Portugal, the paper Público declared:
After Pedrógão the streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.
This Sunday they did nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire.
In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy in June could happen again, as the streets became very late. "
Furthermore, construction permits in locations linked to a high risk of fire.
A further proposal on the whale-form that had brought the government following severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectioned by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.
"the government led a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity of the case, if the applicant has had an open door, so that everything could be built," leads to João Sorval in the same article by Público.
The environmental organisation Quercus made it attentive to spread great surfaces with eucalyptus trees, trees made of slightly flammable wood, as in a vicious circle, according to the fires of this type.
Regarding these problems, the site of the Portugal's civil protection must be found in Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives who was offline.
It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of the fires.
The project was set up in 2015 by the developers of João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and this fateful weekend in October was so decisive that the servers followed up with the onslaught of 400,000 users, who followed the fires, not counted: it counted more than half a million requests.
Even the founders asked for help:

In a night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.
Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke off between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.
Exactly at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghani for the last time with his family at dinner together.
Even if his mother never said it at that time, she knew she would not see her son very long, maybe even more.
During the morning of dawn, the boy should break.
His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the popres.

Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hb-e-Wahdat party, was killed by the Taliban and many Hazara were suddenly transmitting.
The Taliban continued for their hatred for the Hazara famous Taliban.
Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.
A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself back in Pakistan.
For a few years he worked in a cohaul. the work was heavy and made it ill.
Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself, in order to make himself his living.
Back then as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.
"it was really hard," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.
There was no services there and no heating. we put nylon in front of the open windows, so that we don't freeze it at night. "
After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made themselves ready for the journey to Europe.
During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.
After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.
Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran solely through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day of food in needy.
It is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness quotas is a sort of second chance for asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers are catastrophic in the country.
The rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.
"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special receptive centres" "". "this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""
According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre, if they officially put an application for asylum - which can go after the registration of asylum seekers for months.
Until then, people who have no money for a vacation rental, have either relied on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road.
And so it was Ashark.
But his unmissable life of life helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.
After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf had its entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.
This was so good, that he opened a second hostel after a while, and a whisperlover was opened.
Asharaf Baratis Success Story the topic of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.
The film won the Venice City Award in 2017 since the first time in 2017.

The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.
Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.
Approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy according to official estimates.
For many of them, the country is a transition solution to other European countries.
In recent years, some Afghan-driven companies, including cutting eries, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.
Some Afghan restaurants even praised in the Italian media for their excellent cuisine.
In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the staff are mainly refugees from different parts of the world.
The restaurant's menu is told by the various Afghani, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy.
The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.
Asharafs goals, however, are far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail, and aim back to the country, which he had to leave as a teenager.
"where a risk is, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people suffer.
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.
They represent half of society and must have the same possibilities as everyone else. "
Ashark forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and preserving techniques. "thus, they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.
The development of successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there are stability and prosperity.
Ashark has made this journey itself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this way.
