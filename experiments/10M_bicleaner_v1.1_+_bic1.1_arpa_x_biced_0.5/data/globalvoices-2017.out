although I had visited the USA at least once a year , I would now live for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read and operated American music .
in fact , this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly known because of an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less present@@ er who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ d , the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the US was yet reinforced .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had a very shy love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his bott@@ ling .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he tells what he thinks about how a former colleague put it off , and publicly declared its contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won by the republi@@ can election was the highest number ever reaching out of the party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters in accordance with the people I met in Phoenix , during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic programme , people from all over the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
the Tr@@ um@@ ps Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr that her life fights for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and my colleagues to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me a lot of my career .
these people and they em@@ bodied by them em@@ bodied my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump got his way to the nominated republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out to be the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ atism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , I broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people have agreed , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful , suggest@@ ing an in@@ ability to understand those who deal with a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most knows , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country , which she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly remember the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to find a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; rebellion against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ons , &quot; word play from white in watching the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means the great Van Jones &quot; name , has just killed what America has made such a great way .
millions of people around the globe appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is to everyone .
for this country chose two pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ ite , whose story itself , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America , after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , they say .
at all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a wor@@ ding with the crowd .
Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your United States ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your United States ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and silent &quot; NE@@ HE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love for music by garbage ?
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments , &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Flick@@ r User O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , together with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ colony ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ ker ) has now been playing in the community : one of children and adults , existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra which has found their musical instruments a way to overcome the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs ab@@ uses and the band violence .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI believes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music made of tr@@ ash
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recy@@ cl@@ able waste material :
music with re@@ comp@@ eted instruments made up of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez has begun to turn parts of the query into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remembers the first time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same spot the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced by tr@@ ash .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of restored material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspi@@ rational acting from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully fighting illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine showing specifically about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental issues .
the re@@ publication occurs within the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing by illegal fishing waters before the other coast of Africa visited Africa .
in this way , East African countries were up@@ lifting and slightly incl@@ ined to welcome a law@@ suit of this kind in its co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised themselves rapidly against the ship . they refused to take one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who were just refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembers Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing industry . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects against criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are six countries who drove the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and work together . they share information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to increase . this is illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species should be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm the delicate balance .
however , during actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail , the actions occurred in real @-@ time , with trace@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries , for example , can exchange lists of licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such as those that hin@@ der a ship will wi@@ pe his caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a fish licence , where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships can &apos;t sell their cargo to their cargo , and that they could even be forced to use of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Senior Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant firm that is involved in the struggle against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the first platform was created to win an estimated $ 20 million to lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of the illegal f@@ ishers that penet@@ rate East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are also illegal fishermen .
these practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , fake license documents , speci@@ fies ph@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fish protected species and fish in nature conservation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are targeted the lack of international collaboration and make the weak@@ nesses of a no longer organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship could say illegal and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must@@ n &apos;t walk to the port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale as@@ sh@@ ole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front will work .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has exposed criminal networks , which had distributed licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found whis@@ per@@ ing ships .
based on his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i to give susp@@ icious ships more precise .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly evol@@ ving , helps to raise the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal f@@ ishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , head analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO who also deals with fisher@@ man data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be addressed by satellites .
this is why the Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find discrimin@@ ating ships with a larger precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations really influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that can offer satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that &apos;s just sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ ling their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project running in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ective , but also shop@@ pers .
ships that have been fishing earlier without licenses and could hardly expect consequences , so they know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the members involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now increased a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats and more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tra@@ w@@ l nets , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now they are fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country left his first major triumph in October : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and have been banned by tow@@ ing nets .
the ship was also banned in prohibited water , which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative study to the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles appears in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further to : demonstrations in several cities committed to the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the government of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations ran over the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ west of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ates continually , which makes the everyday use of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans through an acute lack of food and pharmac@@ euticals .
many representatives of the opposition saw Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro as the opportunity for a fundamental change in the minister of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , however , blocking a re@@ election of the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Dí@@ az , Con@@ tribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government &apos;s context in its latest article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to give the country the opportunity to re@@ inv@@ ent its institutional structures and close a new governance .
to join the elections of the National Assembly , the campaign against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was forced to join the National Assembly to join the National Assembly on 27 October . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike began to join the National Assembly as well as a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ elan government , on November 3 , should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is , as far as Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday state of civil war and on 3 November all went to Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the fair@@ yt@@ ale , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most often shared images shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the prot@@ ections : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans cri@@ es out . &quot; &quot; &quot;

particularly large waves beat the message through police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed support of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry co@@ ats because you could otherwise see what many nation@@ alities don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic on the round which forms the extent of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a loan procedure - these have now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Labs include :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your official leadership !
on the road !
others evaluate this protests as a further step in the fight against a government which has been taken out of their view little against the devastating economic crisis , making it more critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the fair@@ yt@@ ale always take part in frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they were hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argent@@ in@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is being published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba .
in the meantime , Qui@@ j@@ ano said , in the context of the big La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
starting with the brush , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he held the secret sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks , and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was an endless military officer . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret service division 141 in La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val absorption .
this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors that is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who witnessed the mag@@ nit@@ ude of atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photograph and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are pleased with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t lead you one day , and then I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Guard Party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be o@@ bedient .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had raised me .
in the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university closures , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ Since the prisoners are tortured ...
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he participated in the second time he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little wrap in a blanket , and ordered me to wear it on the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were shut down , and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I ran in , and saw a couch , tortured in man .

later I found out that they sealed it at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just caught there .

the cont@@ ention in it was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell instantly and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that those people were killed &quot;
when my father participated in the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried the eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses where naked people were lying down on the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people still kept silence on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors of the Civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , the director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path , where you came in here , is also the way to which the un@@ ites came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ ferred .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was even at the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war yield gains a b@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or maybe military rab@@ bit which one is fought against an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I was always asked how my father , the director of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand that .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminals and I answered : and you who sti@@ cky the cars on the road ?
you are no criminals ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me , and cried ,
if you go so far , then I will find you and comp@@ ile you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a fellow @-@ mate for this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay down for the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to tell .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last vile act &apos;
now , where I &apos;m older , I feel repentance .
I have children . if one has only children , you can recognize the value of a life .
you continue to develop and realize that it &apos;s wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were ex@@ ek@@ at@@ ted during the dictatorship of people . but why should the bodies disappear ?
why do children lead us ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they would have just been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
were these people not even families where they could be delivered to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last vile act , which one can do to man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and somewhere there - no idea where . &quot; you never find something , &quot; my father said .
but something remains always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea to display my father , arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly , and asked me what the entire patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me to participate in a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I registered the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can throw me out that I am pres@@ et . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest at the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful freedom of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by following death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping under 10 years of child .

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the ten@@ dering of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 Sig@@ op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Tribunal sentenced to life sentences in 28 cases and sentenced to death sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were free acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .

all the accused were members of the military , former military member , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by non @-@ human heads .
the tribunal is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that worked for years on justice for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ W.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people , who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government passed to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial was erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &apos;s &quot; terrible driving &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
adap@@ ting the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month , a very particularly mis@@ used translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word ( co@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may fal@@ sely fal@@ sely - but perhaps also transl@@ ating with mal@@ icious post@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # 8@@ 212 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was on electronic ads in the entrance area and to read in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator of Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local lo@@ ids so attentive .
the Kyoto , the Kyoto , released in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the f@@ law@@ less English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; mar@@ tial &quot; ( German : &quot; terri@@ fic mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if there were also gramm@@ atically not correct ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in Kyoto pre@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore she explained that the error had already been included in the text , which they had received from trans@@ lators and that the translation was not tested on their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt by in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) on our other side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast news set something more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ist in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of motor@@ ist drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents , which are nationwide in accidents , but certainly to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 have been caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
by doing so , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents in the same period .
the rep@@ utable ones did not appear in the published version of the article comments to the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces a few Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) do not mean reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread so widespread in Asia throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true fund@@ ament for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are varied .
for transfer@@ ring two important capabilities : passive language skills , to understand the text @-@ text and active language skills to transfer it into the destination language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in native languages . generally , the belief that trans@@ lators in the target language - do not have to be in the starting language - native language .
this is how a French native language should translate from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ a collabor@@ ator with English as a mother tongue who could produce translations into English . this may be due to an understanding of the su@@ cking , cost @-@ jumps or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees , have not yet been fir@@ med . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English than the best , are made to trans@@ lators , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ rying and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation , show that this technology can still not replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the wei@@ ght@@ ful English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that are often used by T @-@ shirts or bags , are not used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .

translation errors may be un@@ acceptable or at least harmless . but of great companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto &apos;s Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and interest measures on the internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they don &apos;t have access to online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the Internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV were not yet accessible anymore .
other online broad@@ caster transm@@ ited photographs of the protests in Caracas , which were organised by opposition groups , which by the Government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive , and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos Dí@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and recommended the Us@@ ern , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ elan providers are locked once again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular in the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ists with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ itated over protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with pur@@ pen@@ alties and closure , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , since the Commission saw it as a &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have filed myself at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ ov later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online broad@@ caster . this also affects the website where the National Assembly carries their meetings .
earlier research studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that local Internet service providers had to take advantage of DNS . this is a technology that will answer the DNS @-@ server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server does not answer or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ is@@ oli@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
when V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried out the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was sm@@ itten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to the show .
even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thereby , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ern of access to multimedia reporting on the country &apos;s current events will always continue .
in Paraguay , many girls become a slave to get an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ b@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts Zeu@@ s of other cri@@ adi@@ ers , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly auth@@ orization of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ ani@@ que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , processed and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not living together with the family who lived there .
just before her studies at the University , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride in her . she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , it is called the more than 4@@ 6.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfer their under@@ age @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to afford more days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you can &apos;t raise .
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice , is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , re@@ acted and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude , that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ adi@@ ers , guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
it is the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the faith that they will improve their education , improve their position in society and &quot; something from itself &quot; can be translated to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which acc@@ uses the girl with faith , justi@@ fies that she would give someone a chance that would not have any education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl har@@ assed the girl , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never experience them .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent stripes . in short , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the population of the population .
Mar@@ ín was living in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported over the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ b@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they noted the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together in protest petitions and demanded that there were no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couples and almost 60 civil society demanded an independent investigation .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín would be landmark , if for the first time in history , a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before the court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when Far@@ bi@@ k , who worked in her father , had to register and lost their father &apos;s work .
their brothers now had to work and began to buy money on the street or on the market of sweets to make money .
they went all further to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
it had to divide the time so that you stayed with learning still time .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
on Fri@@ days , she pur@@ ged the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more they work with learning , the more leisure it had .
but this time was limited , because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get an unlimited meal . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the househ@@ older than food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some depar@@ ting of the land@@ lords Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and Editorial made of opposition elements such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media over the dictator &apos;s regime .
he kept her for intelligent , but did not sit with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who listened to , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t often allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , who would speak to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education they had made , once again , explains them .
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they paid from them , with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are cri@@ b@@ ating when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , has a cri@@ b@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friends arise , I felt particularly clearly that I had belonged to any group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

draft bill proposes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees have agreed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreed on a draft bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Reg@@ ulations regarding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users and social media must be registered in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , a place would then be established , which is instructed , citizens and citizens to share a permit to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , user and users have to register in the site of their real names and personnel number numbers to use social networks .

the bill that consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and support in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others through a voice , video @-@ based and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set when it is assumed that Egyptian authorities are not able to imp@@ ose the registration for users and users who do not register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation on stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liament@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the legislative elections , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a us@@ ername , and a password to come through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to raise a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians , to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it &apos;s not known so far , that such plans stand .
experts from the site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( at German &quot; leading research projects &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt Initiative &quot; ) , told global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters which have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they have violent physical public and private spaces , it may also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to carry it to a trial process .
that is technically realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft first must be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before going to debate in the debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and acceptance will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against Cy@@ ber crime , in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those provided for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan &apos;s nor@@ theastern Iraq , the animal lady H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the ast@@ o@@ stly Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger leop@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of its habitat and as they always find less spo@@ ils .
why is this particular kind of Leopard so important ?
as R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; is the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards in fact is small and goes to zero . as the team has therefore established that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks out R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist shows R@@ aza passion@@ ately likes another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March , 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , who had reached the progress made up in the last six years , had reached the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , tsunami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had been triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a common pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , who had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to van@@ ish because the tsunami had filled whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture had an atomic accident , already alone , some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view that progress has been achieved for six years , to re@@ building the life of the local population .
the detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese restoration authority as well as a survey of the affected themselves .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( of the city , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
according to I@@ w@@ ate , 75 percent of such houses are finished , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima is the final light for Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
while still , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ n@@ fs@@ wald , ev@@ acu@@ ated by shel@@ ters ( mar@@ c@@ et@@ eri@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) res@@ ett@@ lement to the final replacement parts .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of ev@@ acu@@ ees were moved after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the stand of work and daily life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , their gateway to December 2016 , which constitutes nearly 98 percent of schools in three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation once again , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima alone , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bors have resum@@ ed their operation .
the tsunami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have been dra@@ gged .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic bomb , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered quickly again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again to 90 per cent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the daily newspapers led numerous surveys under the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation by . she asked them about the booth of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed over the tsunami risk .
in its introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey through to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population of experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident population has taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disasters associated with disasters .
as it stands for those who had ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima was not only forced to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident , ever experiencing Japan .
of the 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were re@@ located in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , something more than 23@@ ,000 people had been res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , which had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spar@@ ity houses .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their homeland pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are still more than 50 years old . they are in proper ability to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , we often see that a more un@@ ites than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately became very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that often get less attention when they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over speech and country borders .
Veron@@ ika E@@ gher@@ man talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time that she has worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday the police officer had defeated him at a demonstration against the head in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia a demonstration against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and suffered several frac@@ tures .
doctors performed him this Saturday and moved it into an artificial coma now .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures also the face of the police officer , which was attacked with a striking stock . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announces that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident recorded by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his drum@@ stick to the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was checked by a demonstr@@ ator and in the intensive care station , his face would see six months on television and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia divided the video of Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs briefly appe@@ aled to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video showing the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in the social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been divided repeatedly in the social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he had been sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked on the intensive care centre , after he was attacked by a polic@@ eman , who struck him with a punch stock .
police officers
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to the demonstr@@ ators last Friday to demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen were put at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
S &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via speakers to aband@@ on violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media are sp@@ un up by using the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window of wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a broken glass window to meet with a photo of their title pages illu@@ stra@@ tive .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who are serving the defense of a specific cause .
this is necessary to recognize , if you are strictly against any form of non @-@ damage .
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; get a absurd , un@@ event@@ ful meaning , and the typical violence against the military police are inter@@ cep@@ ted with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the ab@@ duc@@ ts of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane seeds included the doors to the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Municip@@ ality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no notable sugar be@@ est in the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were painted in the sugar cane plants .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its investments until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories , that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dat@@ env@@ elop@@ an , opened every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane seeds in the eastern region , which after long in@@ active time are in operation because they were preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene reminds you precisely that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar factory was preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar industry resistance already with@@ stands the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ suffici@@ ency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the poor harv@@ ests are no more recent .
why was the Cuban sugar@@ cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs , which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar@@ cane plant@@ ations and the growth crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar is between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; Agriculture institutions &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar supply would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with safety , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar mill factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene is known as a soldier on the closing of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all of those questioned are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first school year , the first letters began to come .
officially , documents were officially distributed to documents related to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see , and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ am Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any dis@@ appro@@ ving .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operating sugar mill factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will to dis@@ closing the factory , whose construction he helped , was involved .
in every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas that factories not have been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar@@ cane milling
sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the Municip@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane finished , or better said than they began to inv@@ ade them , they also stopped to restri@@ ct the road to asph@@ alted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were given to spare parts .
without future perspectives , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the provision of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations te@@ ens use hip @-@ hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
take a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young Nations communities in the whole of Canada are busy with topics that are important for them . they are doing with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
since 2014 , part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour offer mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres , in order to bring youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will ensure that the young participants in discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever the meaning comes in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the School &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ Canadian , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not cleared .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , as important for ob@@ taining traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , even though the young people are unable to master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young@@ sters involved some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ hop Group , who gave them a St@@ roph@@ one in the Eastern @-@ Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an is available the rop@@ he into tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel , as no one would ever care for me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that &apos;s the day you &apos;ll take our cry out
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth .
thus , they can do what it intended for the Creator

in Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is located exactly on the menu , will be found near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( mar@@ tial arts , &quot; Plastic Products of the dishes &quot; ) of each food that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at this plastic dishes , and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry devoted to manufacturing this plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi District K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that made the German Film filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them again . however , a new trend is transformed into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now available in special sale : new with plastic shred@@ ded mobile tapes , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few shots fri@@ dges for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the Essen@@ ti@@ fications is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case , an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel cycle with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also have made this part for the Tokyo Exhibition .
and here is an apple , who are holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of a growing flight into the comic .

on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can che@@ ating my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .

a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly occur only in statistics . however , this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the streets or to the municipalities that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone fund , in the hundreds of bones , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never cure .
this is why the Mexican News portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with the drug trade , &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the implic@@ ations are much deeper .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers , and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how much life has changed &quot; ) just tell these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is searching for secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father only a single day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task before we have made us go , and after the graves we have loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never arrived . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay it out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who pose a fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on readers of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never look at normal as normal , regardless of what form it occurs :
I have been aware of the disease and sensor journ@@ alism for some years now .
I arrive every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures that are actually only from a textbook for criminals or from the specialists of specialists .
it sp@@ ends me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who had disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) , when it is tall . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me this is , when would they mo@@ urn those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic .
the in@@ action of people is incredible to me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour was justified that they were &quot; settled . &quot;
I think they try to talk about that they will be spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital District : how a family with threats became pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this , it describes as armed criminal month for the month of money from their business until they were not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain , it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again if you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed from each other , the better .
she joined her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will disp@@ oss@@ ess or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deepest root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn how to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement at the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other young boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a father@@ less and he tells us to teach himself how to make an egg boiled , potatoes bre@@ wed , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and that had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has already passed two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders and the Government of Public Safety and the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the public prosecutor &apos;s office 3@@ 103 murders were counted , equivalent to 8.5 murders per day .
these are some hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories still live in the face of the new headlines . but this project reminds us of those who do not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico is set up in 2015 with the objective of portra@@ ying the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tortured the country in the past four decades , in understand@@ able manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages where he is linked , include pictures where violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment where it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or to un@@ mask a fake .
but how is the years after the first time emerged ? content in social media , whether true or unexpected , ten@@ ds to pass on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been fully exploited , trage@@ dies to be@@ ep trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong cl@@ utch of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false Con@@ text &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our demand for pictures too .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ car crossed the site San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pping around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came into life .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second biggest country had been neglec@@ ted and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became more dangerous pl@@ ain@@ ers , which were difficult to be@@ fall .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to the victims .
we described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a movie near , which was full of people who witnessed the football World Cup .
houses scattered and per@@ tin@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Mehr@@ ere photos of the incident make the grey scenes this day .
up is an example .
it shows rows of hollow bodies , which are rounded up during the floor while people look at them .
but this is not the end of the story .
over the years , the same photo was captured several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but they seem to be attributed to the related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
on January 3 , 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the dra@@ g@@ atory villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch .
many have been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture appeared on the DR Congo again , as it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass strikes .
a step further , personal comments , such as the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge came in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , the UN described those who could flee , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an aci@@ dic news page , which fal@@ sely said that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an have said , monks and politicians had participated in the Ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to record these information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , AFP as their source , had also fal@@ sely accused Th@@ an His statement , but did not allow the image from the DR Congo in relation to them .
the global operating range of false information
tracks of this wrong coupling until the years 2011 and 2012 are actually coming back to all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far information limits can be exceeded .
a reverse picture search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 Pictures , which are very similar to the discussed image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixer of private sites , platforms social media and common areas as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have made examples of the abuse of use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page it had been published . therefore , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language only .
examples listed below ( which in some cases were also linked to each other ) can date several examples of mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can still be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false cou@@ plings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or servers , which are still available in the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ es , are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ers .
as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts Against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City only ren@@ ders the mis@@ use of the image , but also discuss the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions following the Inten@@ tions of the Persons and the trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as his source the Spanish Intelligence Agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre as shown here , the image from the DR Congo used to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no sides such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who contra@@ di@@ ct this .

this site used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ erian Christians .
this asser@@ tion was denied by a Greek fact check @-@ in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of the students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in N@@ asi@@ m &apos;s news agency and to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a inhabitants of the Alt@@ stad@@ t@@ ine P@@ ie@@ dic@@ ast@@ ello of Tren@@ to posted this message to his page to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as a demonstration for the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for an ab@@ rupt use of the image from the DR Congo , with one hand on a Twe@@ et , the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand , the attempt of a blog , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to del@@ li@@ lac , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar has published a judge for what it meant as &quot; decre@@ asing messages and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which is exclusively published in English , includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors who are using H@@ ate Speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to determine that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( what is often widespread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; mineral water with terrace . &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , reveals that the DR @-@ Congo &apos;s image shows Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an existed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article has been updated in 2014 and this release is still included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now sol@@ dered , the Catholic near the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a similar one @-@ like attack .
when the picture appeared in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 in circulation , the El Pa@@ is attempted to opp@@ ose it into Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the DR Congo picture appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in Paris and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took this event , which took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ pt up for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times kne@@ aded ) . but the messages that were connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message was recorded by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre was in circulation , discussion forums , as described here on Vietnamese and declared it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ inet Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further confirmed examples of a er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , Ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( based on portfolio in grey ) , are also no longer trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time@@ - / date stamp exist in the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and united them to Muslims with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which was first published clearly according to the original disaster of 2010 , the image is probably probably a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that move through this posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murdered victims of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when reading these images could not give any longer faith .
with social media , there are many people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the share of drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ leading and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ador@@ ns it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of non @-@ violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that , to detect the re@@ jection of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that non@@ violent images , readers , and viewers assume the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which inter@@ act as violent media to help others ) .
while there are some more violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ ented because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to re@@ consider thoroughly about situation in which a picture is somewhat suggests , but in context of context or totally ab@@ used type can be used .
an investigation of false assur@@ ances should be considered as an international investigation as well .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ Trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. in@@ comprehen@@ sible ) endeav@@ oured to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to be translated .
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often complex or specific .
some of these in@@ comprehen@@ sible words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish brake ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation , and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole period in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba yourself for your parents in recognition of how to make you ende@@ avor for yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ettle language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having grown in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you influence us how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ist on this page would like to publish and show more of these &quot; un@@ parall@@ eled &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite characters .

according to a review of the Sri Lanka cat@@ astrop@@ hic plane from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ding and s@@ lu@@ dge .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 secure residence types .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the waters in some areas were slowly back .
health and hygiene rati@@ os constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of flood catastrophe :

last year after the disaster of the tropical Storm Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me took a &quot; high water aid &quot; key , allowed users allowed to call a vehicle to pick up help and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ic Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key , which had included more than thousands of requests and 150 successful re@@ bo@@ ret@@ ariat for high water and land@@ slides included people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , put residents in need in need of security and help the aid of assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long way up to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use in January , when in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend .
I trusted her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sk@@ etch we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , others will fight against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; These things concern not you , &quot; or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? , &quot; I ask .
I have already led this conversation .
people , with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has set up in their performance .
they mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we recognize ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , that are not fit there , dis@@ car@@ ded .
un@@ for@@ mi@@ zed will be de@@ capit@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come in a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a big part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslims in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which has been colonial books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark men that you should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the landmark of Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward Said put the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images are even further developed today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are still ongoing .
I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I saw how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rative domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are encouraged to bear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and avoid su@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ened Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were brought down with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has deeply impressed our collective pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing strength , often sigh@@ ting men and children become the objective of anti @-@ mic attacks and sei@@ zu@@ res .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives , helping us understand the world .
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to certi@@ fy the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation which come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
utili@@ zation approved .
four decades ago , my parents immig@@ rated to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design at 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were allowed by the Muslim , American St@@ acker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan thinking about the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ disputed Muslims and Americans .
but am I un@@ disputed Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who carry all Muslims with respect - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ esting , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we don &apos;t need to be the@@ ological expert in order to be &quot; Muslim , &quot; or almost always to be selected for additional safety checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make efforts to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ tasted Islam@@ opho@@ bia , think tanks and experts for counterfeit information which is our already f@@ law@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a fore@@ ig@@ ner , who plu@@ cked the head@@ scarf with a woman .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it addresses our identity that is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .
the author was built in 1986 on a photograph of her kinder@@ garten group .
utili@@ zation approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born to be Muslim , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they rely on the following terms : faith , conduct and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that will separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms , and you would be called the Arab @-@ verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ uls .
I repeat three times each of them .
therefore , I ask you to be protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim supplements are always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she gains a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters eventually pos@@ ing in the 1960s .
utili@@ zation approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal side with their sisters ; as they win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see my eyes close : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and an Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen capit@@ als which it can be almost rot@@ ated .
to be Muslim , to speak the prayers that they had said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim , as they taught me to refer to God , Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been colonial over centuries - by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of honest British Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ ar@@ ie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .
the author was born in 1987 with her grandfather .
utili@@ zation approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not weep , but at the same time to see my inf@@ ring@@ ed grandfather wept .
zw@@ isch@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept around his family in India &apos;s ruling c@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like in my grandfather , were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means that over the past two centuries , Europeans have been colonial to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ pper bomb was thrown off before a century over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time , Grand@@ father of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ asch@@ mir@@ ic sub@@ jection of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there was air@@ planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ e ; our un@@ expect@@ ant history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to hunt mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the veter@@ ans of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story will report four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al from a free black slaves .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means Malcolm X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it &apos;s the hope I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
an American woman , a p@@ im@@ i , a c@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , an Punj@@ ab@@ i , an Punj@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim , and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multilingual con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to provide me with my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is supported by President Bush in the Muslim registry , and under President Obama , under President Obama .
it consists in per@@ cep@@ tible monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration agents who adop@@ ts a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its limits to people from just countries that bom@@ bed it .
it &apos;s a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely takes Arab and Muslims .
we are the wars that we lead , and the bombs , which we throw in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically relevant image and asked them to assess the groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the smallest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the f@@ law@@ less and dangerous expression , which we ste@@ amed in our news conference .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry that tries to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , prolifer@@ ating Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global period of time , in which we are located .
and this moment has some consequences of going beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spir@@ ators , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now run the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years before , it had not been given them ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I wasn &apos;t aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but that made me today to an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things I have left here like a break of bread in my speech .
things that might wake memories , because in all those inter@@ actions that make our humanity , a story likes to listen to a &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley you will find conversation within the 8th Annual Meeting on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
however , these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read that we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars will be led , and people through the monkeys of the &quot; others &quot; will be enth@@ used in public performance , four decades ago even research of Stan@@ ford .
we must un@@ comfortable ask ourselves according to the role of his , conscious and un@@ conscious of the &quot; other &quot; as it did my girlfriend and I think we have a new future in which we have no pre@@ sidents , while having already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other @-@ made &quot; people , go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban freedom
stor@@ yt@@ ellers count , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in its original language is an answer to this .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided , if we do cities , accept diversity - safe rooms , in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Listen is often connected to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check out these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to feeling , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers ask her story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and their depic@@ tion are that the listen@@ ers will slip on it .
they cry out laughing and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story of stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou takes the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of nar@@ rative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the bun@@ ny and the p@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the importance of his fork , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of the included :
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were quite with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can join T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller performances .
Puerto Rico calls for state debt of state debt
with the aim of a re@@ trial of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march was launched at the pu@@ ert@@ orian capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ enship ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church of Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ mun@@ eration of debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies are responsible for the debts of their corruption .
we call for financial testing and an management committee without personal interests in public debts , with a solid , our working conditions of the respective re@@ mun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not inv@@ ade their retirement pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the state of an integral part of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law gover@@ ning state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis , Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures imposed on the outside continued to run by the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger , rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration carried out the name &quot; Night@@ ing@@ ache for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi is known for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and members continue to continue their freedom and remember the contributions that he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that will be hosted in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France @-@ resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ come ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective replica ) .
the book , published in the last year , has been released here , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on site to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and make some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the list of the Ad@@ ra prison , where he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
we have not seen any information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family to provoke him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temp@@ oral beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and attor@@ ney N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police Bass@@ el had taken part on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; of the military court from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by a alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place and state remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of bass @-@ cultural prototypes was more predic@@ ting than the work that he began around in 2005 with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ side of several civilians and merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el wasn &apos;t able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything about this architecture , not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this stri@@ pping in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ al@@ u@@ able to the public as well as scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in custody .
I have learned to read English well , to write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened me the gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a pro@@ xy , which she wrote in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he translated them from the Arab into English .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose my reflection in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
that any of the dangers , no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of pris@@ ons
and I dr@@ inge in every detail your voice and words .
I wear the passion for me ,
if your eyes say empty
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and about your absence to weep and to smile .
I testify to myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :

Bass@@ el &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests in 2011 , Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime has disappeared for more than 6@@ 5,000 people in the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime , tortured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in custody .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption was sentenced to previous post by corruption .
the Mozambique re@@ acted with wrath on a corruption case , when a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state machine in which corruption was committed .
this is the arrest of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 along with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for the dis@@ appointment of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , the Rat Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and promp@@ tly called his re@@ location into the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a position of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who accepted the application , there would be no obstac@@ le to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to refer to his old posts , as the company did not fully compreh@@ end a disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many residents do not like this action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , brief C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned to the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview :
imagine a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP .
what we take in mind is that the company should have a disciplinary proceedings against the contra@@ dic@@ ts .
however , the company kept silent , however , and promp@@ ted no appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be an advisor , after he was sentenced to prison and served half .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has approved to be integrated into the company that he helped damage harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .

Facebook has blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means a chick@@ pe@@ a or sp@@ y@@ fish .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the background of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to as@@ sign up to human indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or that of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely abra@@ sive con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself is not calling on an automatically Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts who have discussed the use of the word or expressed a doubt for his use to be expressed .
moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same characters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spher@@ ical ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ book A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
one post of my friends was er@@ ased today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way if she knew how he could lin@@ t his back pain by making a word play .
the proposition ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ire is the opinion that it will be more radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical that Facebook has to be analytical that it dis@@ sol@@ ves all the po@@ sts that were suspected to spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ ly the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm does not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what to do instead , is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( palette knife ) .
the good thing is that this dirty nation@@ alists , the hate language dis@@ semin@@ ate a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action is a powerful signal to everybody , the hate language does not like to spread the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that c@@ ens@@ orship is often going to start a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , with the user of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete its posts , when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new gui@@ del@@ ine of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I gave the li@@ king , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a number of people away from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the Post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more than expected on the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask Council :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words , only hatred will bring hatred within the different communities .
it seems like if they have started this without local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; In@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have been prohibited .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they do not tried to rec@@ ti@@ fy the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if only a little more respect for the 15 million use they would have a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has received a lot of spo@@ ilt by users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that are not contained in Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch a pe@@ a cur@@ ry dish and watching an Indian film .
just to try whether Facebook contains the mail which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who used social networks to extend their votes and their influence , increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks may also pre@@ heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where there were fighting between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the bal@@ ancing Hass@@ aries on his bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
but instead of using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , rather in context than upon code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end of the day@@ time

the child@@ care is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to offer a law which aims to ban this practice , so that it is now wise at age 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ tery , some members were noted in practice , and in May 2016 , it came to a huge public out@@ cry ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups in the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state should not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened , despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contract partner of the UN Child Labour Convention , the min@@ ors of persons under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married in the age of 15 , Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical significance confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tioning and social media movements , who endeav@@ ors to abol@@ ish laws for children , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu guides , for instance , had no concerns to say the critics of the children , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition intended for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts , whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent that could be discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would take him to the law .
now only the president of the country agre@@ es and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators issued a status update on Facebook that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes in the House of Represent@@ atives .
after he had decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to children .
dear Francis , who was a member of the ministry of education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary sense , used the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s care is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is almost every price .
during Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : real news !
the bill has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law is noted :
the holi@@ er age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz was today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and were present 35 by the vote .
all MPs , who were against the law , agreed for the law .
children care is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ ild@@ i .
many thanks to all activists who have depos@@ ited him .
con@@ gr@@ ats . congratulations .
thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
before months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take court steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to resolve his promises .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supporters of the law said it was quite clear when Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users were desi@@ rable to go into the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of speaking the discussion so commonly , in a way that only panic and im@@ ony may cause it to talk about the state in our bedrooms that it may be ab@@ used to them that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ s@@ lan@@ ted men that are mis@@ used against them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a court case against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they say .

by using web sites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content once more
the Wikipedia page was presented to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation on January 18 , 2012 .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now locked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle of based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information .
students as well as rep@@ orters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
although many techni@@ qu@@ ent Internet users are used to use changing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been locked out by Wikipedia , just as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society was held at Harvard University , finding regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
in China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform released all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. computer @-@ host links ) , which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal ban .
in a B@@ log@@ post reports IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after having heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to complete snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is a possibility to read the contents of de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org website .
IP@@ FS also provided that this step was run independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ z@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ Pages that is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror .
one is access@@ ing another URL , which is not the original . that which one can see is by Wikipedia .
essentially , the server leads the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if these are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ pr@@ one rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and balanced colours .
this motivated him to bear a camera , and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ on to bring Nepal on international stage to the international scene .
and his homeland is right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that drive the attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) invited me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the leop@@ ard was once and I immediately began to kne@@ ad pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he ought to know , for he stood by face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b anything from the opinion of sheep ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was in the darkness at home , when suddenly the King of the boy appeared . he sits immediately , we see and he star@@ es me through the s@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ter in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days until he was able to take a tiger and take six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .

after the marriage , Indian women had their first time to appeal to their husbands &apos;s name
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with great care , to address the name of their husbands , or even older men in the family .
instead , they use an pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women to respect the husband due to social pressure , and fear of consequences should they acc@@ use the norm , these practice will receive life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted by a placebo court and viol@@ ated her family and the village community after having addressed a pre@@ heated relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives , also not even named among men , is also common among men . however , they have far less supplements to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main feature of the city .
it is a place just for them , to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets itself for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the network of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and they simultaneously made the mur@@ als of the wall .
the first video showing the Roh@@ ini in their discussion round was women who did not call their husbands at name .
she decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which women can easily identify themselves .
to address the name of their husbands , an attempt to reck@@ on all obligations and never questioned them will never be questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testified that a woman has respected her husband and wishes a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t enter this will be regarded as a rec@@ l@@ is@@ ant , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought of this discussion round about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini who has never named her husband had never mentioned in the name , at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini is telling :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at an end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started her first Disc@@ ussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant in telling the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us as they want , that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years , and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ eding of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which she married women the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini is telling :
a woman was so shy that she was going ast@@ ray during the whole practice ; another di@@ stra@@ y decided to allow the entire fruit@@ less fru@@ stration against him and his family to curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ renal@@ ine of ad@@ renal@@ ine , having broken with an ancient bre@@ ach , the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another club member decided to do it at supper before the whole family .
she was afraid as her mother @-@ in @-@ law , she was afraid , saying that it was an error .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in terms of less understand@@ able and the situation took place in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the su@@ cking of the c@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ ok @-@ red dot if he would like it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard there@@ on to bear him .
the other women didn &apos;t stop completely with it , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days .
for many women the Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with each Disc@@ ussion club .
normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about who could listen to what could hear , &quot; she says .
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their lives , their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang talking about things which they had never made thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I have also made known about some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties linked to our husbands , never spoken as honest .
it feels great to say some things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talk about the concept of honour and , as it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only bore sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them this is okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a tro@@ users , they did not have a weed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of its own coat election , mor@@ als associated with Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini their own couple Kur@@ tas ( upper inhibit@@ or ) into a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create .
on the question , whether in the five months have already changed a bit , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly in the roles :
we have only made small steps until now .
some women tried it a couple of times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ heads .
the women in discussion lu@@ b know that changes they would like in their life - like the f@@ eil@@ ing around more freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
as they give each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also here .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if any woman walks in the club to home and other people tell about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for dealers , presumably for super@@ believing purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province of Mozambique . the local government has now called a number of operations into life to stop the practition@@ ers .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ca@@ h , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken from .

it is the first time that successive attacks were registered on smooth men in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 introduced a mission to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government started to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who propose to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling according to Mozambique are the goal of Muslim attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assassination of three ke@@ yst@@ one men due to their body parts .

I would like GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambitious , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH is ashamed to offer a country in which the teacher would be ashamed to spend sex against good notes , and in which the teacher would take care of having their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or smooth @-@ member for super@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; they aim to aim to get to rapid wealth .
in spite of the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomena , some of the chance of mak@@ ab@@ ren humor did not miss .

a photo by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had passed in international community attention after his lawyer ended at the end of June , that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State of State ) after being involved in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; he says it as &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
yet , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , permit to vac@@ ate or allow a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
a speaker , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should have pressure to provide a treatment abroad within Liu .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway went into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian Government believes that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations have only continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to re@@ locate the salmon trip to China , as the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread , Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release to an expression and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his detention he was not able to meet his prize .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July the European Parliament passed a decision where China was promp@@ ted to free his wife &apos;s arrest , Liu and his wife were promp@@ tly free from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplomatic platinum of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as they were in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet all visits and receive them , which they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us @-@ Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that Americans have &quot; him that he has the possibility for the treatment abroad , as far as it would help him in his satisfaction . &quot;
a spokesperson for US Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced that the message was inform@@ ing the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities not only Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the US Embassy in China drew a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the exterior of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to participate in and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
protecting and freedom such as travel tips and access to medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merkel and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to imp@@ ose the Chinese government to imp@@ ose Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he could not enter into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported to Beijing &apos;s news agency that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex by Liu could visit the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um requested China to provide an appropriate medical care at providing a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to give himself up of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told him that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to meet Liu , with someone outside , including his attor@@ neys , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us further :
Canada is calling for China to maintain its international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , to preserve the rights of this rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him .
although the news of France information already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , there was no further information published whether France will eventually receive him .
Taiwan
the Council of Russia in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release Liu and establish a major tolerance to those who want to use peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development .
in China , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party called on China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in an explanation on 28 June at Liu &apos;s very worried and suggested that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that he took the initiatives that he took and for which he had been ri@@ pen@@ alised to a harmon@@ ious , stable and weal@@ thy China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to Justice Minister , K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am should be considered a city in Singapore .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Polish Association of the State of New York , the Minister observed that many people critic@@ ise the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people go an error .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to turn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , you can say that we don &apos;t have any country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities , a must @-@ hurt .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons carried out by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared un@@ inten@@ tional un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities which will permanently be led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the subject of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itative character will return to the present demo@@ cr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial co@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions asked him with non @-@ answers of rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng invites Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion , since she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country but a city is , so what country is ours ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point where he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing his comment on the blog , he comments concerning the critics that you should start to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that you can understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am better , according to that Singapore is a city and no country .
read the inscription .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ important , even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections .
he performs Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore was no country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an illustrates his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am , who is a leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which expected me - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even certain if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review covers the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a fri@@ vol@@ ous publisher ?
when Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the City of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
because he plays an important role inside the Govern@@ mental hospital , the statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ g@@ am are the importance of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a land or the inhabitants of a city ?
in addition , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade applies to the event , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have heard many of the people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defence of the land above all &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices said before short , his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect at your hab@@ itation or homeland ?
your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world , and a different fac@@ et shall be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan .
the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation takes place the conversation , it is considered cour@@ teous to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication then the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook inside of anger , if they are held for Americans , but me do not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans offer a Canadian banner good at their back@@ pack , if they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans are ... yet .
so it was , when I began travelling 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small chor@@ us leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons at us !
gay marriage in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often . &quot;
Canada is also considered the toler@@ ant country of ethnic groups .
we are not like those types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
there would be nothing that would make me feel confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; means to be said , basically , to be sp@@ ying - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can encounter .
harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to make no attention .
this can be something good when you go un@@ noticed in the background , distant from the things that happen around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major stake in Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
which accounts as &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool pol@@ iten@@ ess .
Canadi@@ ans do not talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm hear@@ ted , open kindness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odic Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video that the jun@@ ta par@@ ody , which took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to restore civilian government , the country continues to re@@ igns .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what rules make his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military domin@@ ance of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video about the song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video was uploaded to Facebook only 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; has been blocked the dictator &quot; in Thailand after a group of activists trained the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and play@@ ful introduction to Thai politics , especially as it acts with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these images of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been tra@@ ced in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which is the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the host &apos;s absolute decision on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program on the in@@ famous program of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to rep@@ aid activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and persons accused of having s@@ lan@@ dered the monarchy to have criminal prosec@@ utions .
Thailand puts a strict companion against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the War Law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , even as people will be thrown into a black vans , before you bring them into an inter@@ section bearing , another problem fall .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and to make internet users a long term pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who was im@@ itated from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; was already used by coup leaders during the protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society has only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
it is now over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an War was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al shows distinctive images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the aqu@@ atic basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asien .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , par@@ asi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
these settlements are also known as the Catholic capit@@ als in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived here . today , there are only a few hundred people in these cov@@ ites .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people had barely increased after a decade .
in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks from the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are falling and quite rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it &apos;s difficult to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens who served all the community .
now there &apos;s only paved road with amazing spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived at this place and made their contribution to the central plant@@ ation of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , who still accommodate one or two families , recognize the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something and suddenly , they leave the demol@@ ished building and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the Sub@@ si@@ sten@@ z@@ ine ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come over the laps .
the district administration delivers candles in winter free of charge and bread on the villages .

some ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jaz@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her eldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ um to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ aba , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supported her young grand@@ children instead .
gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden or a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do that - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ant G@@ alya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha worked together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , she remembers the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Ukraine , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply departed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration building in Ab@@ ch@@ asien ) .
we want to build a house there , but that will take something else , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ asha received approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
in the proximity of the house where Nat@@ asha kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens once was , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ ops and chickens .
it tells us that there was a very frigh@@ tening situation initially , when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time she lost her fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it was rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there were hardly any work , and everyone lived quite as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation f@@ lowed , a little boy goes over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him .
he plays with the ball , then rolling the hills .
one group of children is now watching the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones to the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of her childhood , who care for uncertainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ cer and gold @-@ colored ear @-@ rings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Bra@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) become an destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with ground @-@ grinding , crum@@ ble walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Frau Ram@@ í@@ rez , people are coming into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sitting outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that drew from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other directions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans speak already on What@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of its companion managers , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker for building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that her guests are sending her often text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chicken to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez may be very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
in the other end of the city , a cu@@ l @-@ gasse road leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ela .
in this winter , Valencia and his family are included in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants can be sold too expensive .
he started trying to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and cooking outside .
Valen@@ ci@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was moved out of the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ia comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all@@ u@@ ating , offered him a roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back to the home of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears , trav@@ ellers consult their teleph@@ ones quiet .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud Grand@@ mother she bl@@ ames her album with many photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair @-@ spots that you have made a demonstration , some photos of her grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers more , young and old .
she laughs sad while she introduces them briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , mar@@ ching and mar@@ ching .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the cell phone users received a mobile phone message in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a cell phone , where they address the District government , to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hin@@ der access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities trusted the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app before they had replaced the app with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes by the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ anders website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users attentive to them how much time they spend online , and to remote control the own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used naturally in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers are able to manipul@@ ate or steal home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , forced ethnic minority interests such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme interest and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ized Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eastern Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , published by local news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police officers had in@@ discrimin@@ ated the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the app will install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected in a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use equipment which are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the surveillance technology .
we are back to Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eastern Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and therefore get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are integrated into X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city @-@ party council which minim@@ ize illegal content .
all government agencies , agencies , and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions from Cyber@@ security Office to follow their computers and communication equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , a U.S. human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree establishing all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media @-@ memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy this action . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible clubs , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experience in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and specify that you are all alone in one place where everything has disappeared .
everything has emerged after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and reve@@ aling a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all the glory .
one that is defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you pick the reality again and look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , beautiful scenes and perform@@ ers - transform themselves the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt solve yourself in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the Earth are caught on the axis of ignor@@ ance . you know that you are caught between walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the head of security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put his power on us under evidence , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it suff@@ iced to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts cov@@ eted , but not my own .
for the first time it was silent , ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even if I found no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security and its compli@@ ce .
during the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply was stopped in the neighbourhood .
I broke the silence , by crying out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house .
I heard my voice contra@@ di@@ ly through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we joined us in a splendid picture , full of my expectations and fully fulfilled .
at such a moment you are aware that you delivered the spirit out of the lamp , but it is simply interested in the barley .
I received a call from my father : &quot; ready to meet you , we meet at the military safety office . &quot;
he was laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have done it all the way until the office of security from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear as you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his asser@@ ted eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dream what to look at me in the eyes , not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure of my business when I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret my word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is equal to his father . &quot;
the cont@@ ing@@ ank of this curse lies between me and now in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture that I was exposed to months .
I cry to the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
afterwards through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I consider all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise , they have probably assigned a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission .
after a couple of minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I attacked on a well @-@ known communication method : to strike your fist against the wall .
I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; adult det@@ ain@@ ling . &quot;
after long hes@@ it@@ ating he answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a well @-@ respected male , who sees me similar and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no distinctive facial features , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice looks like me ? &quot;
all answers are linked to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will be interro@@ gated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive all these crow@@ s that lab@@ s up in the fruit of my head .
from the distance I still listened to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; to scre@@ am .
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around these time the scre@@ aming , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of the destro@@ yer is , until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; An@@ gol@@ an on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the secret is out : to protect the state security in front of us and prevent the terrorists and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational replacement map and betra@@ yed the close eye view of her world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I cared for the interro@@ g@@ ation and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least , he looks like this .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that rep@@ lic@@ t him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin to join this day@@ time and protest on demonstrations , which will soon be able to find an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I used to get used to answer .
I can really no longer tell when ins@@ ults and strokes after a friendly conversation has become a normal communication tool .
when and how that happened was in@@ significant .
some voice in me said that I had to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed me to be punished , although I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to rip me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confes@@ sion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker takes you at your scre@@ aming .
give him a pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cry fell not enough to him , so they pressed the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a garbage collector earlier or whether that belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ woven together to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them changed while I was still on the line .
I had lost all my feeling in my body - and my voice , why I heard it to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling , and found no favour at all , why he was next to a electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi@@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect stream@@ ers .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to put my sleep again ; let &apos;s say that it was my only option .
a few hours for@@ getting , that came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the dawn fills the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I reply with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth : &quot; my Lord , my father must make himself terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where to run me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photograph was taken by aman Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indo@@ ors ; sometimes he sm@@ iles at his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
however , on what you can rely on , a cigarette between his fingers or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ stain@@ ed lips can be discovered .
he lives in the top of his family house that belonged to them since 1967 ; the year where Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , the conservative majority reci@@ eved and their old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ music .
with his music that often deals with topics like Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian Refu@@ gee . all these issues can not only be found in its home town of Amman , but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria through to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can join the people who have suffered the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it , he appe@@ aled against the American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Refu@@ gee in the second generation - so he describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b stresses .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he poured into two cups in water . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ um@@ erable boy has little to do with a protest against Islam .
basically , the cups of a warm coffee and the shame of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free sky , especially if one acc@@ uses a view into neighbouring countries .
therefore , one avo@@ ids basic things to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not to land .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has canc@@ eled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Act - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ing that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , which contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tab@@ by .
the MP and former spokes@@ woman for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ man .
many also claim that commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which in@@ query the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila estimated the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to dep@@ loy &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply being sil@@ ly rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clearly evident @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality reflected in Jordan , which appears clear in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b made traditional Sex@@ ually @-@ tern@@ or@@ men to marry his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have vo@@ or@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a evi@@ den@@ ounced wife whose arms and legs are stretched to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trusted .
over the past years , the number of &apos; honorary de &apos; has risen in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch : according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it has still been added that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women , victims , attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law prohi@@ bit@@ ing a law from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ ely bureaucra@@ tic effort , as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , not to be afraid of themes in his country long as tab@@ oos .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , is being aware that he is his music , which is full of explic@@ it attack on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was told of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strong in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic online program Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments were torn from context , twi@@ sted and had been cen@@ sored .
&quot; at Youtube , it was uploaded without a cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b pays open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance about homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ anians do this not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the grounds that they expressed themselves on comments in social media cri@@ tically crucial to the problems , associated with the deeply ro@@ oted corruption .
in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs is said that only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anians .
for him , progress is a permanent link and take it . Jordan has now rever@@ ed for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it sees itself H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , need and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dre@@ amt such as millions of other Arabs also , from a Arab world without interventions abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is supported by music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , scatter@@ ing uni@@ tions , and artificial way .
until the time is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to continue and also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is believed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums , and dancing over more than one thousand years have come across and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al .
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two bu@@ ggy eyes are straight ahead .
however , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival has the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way in the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !

I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre tall fixed car was unbelievable .

seldom were external appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they are helping to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime , and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug dealers are all daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , and N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to provide more norm@@ alities in the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers that can re@@ produce these elabor@@ ate hairdres@@ sers .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even an annual event inspired , the competition of hair@@ style &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts to show each other , to show who can see the exact L@@ ooks out of them , as you can see in the following video ( see additional videos on current competi@@ tor ) on the public Facebook profile ( Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against bar@@ ber tools and place them instead of bad advice on hairdres@@ ser &apos;s clothing that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year early in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ illa fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ messages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guer@@ ri@@ llas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which publishes the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it a lot more important , people that feel extinct , aff@@ ection to common ?
this question came to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) who encouraged young people to write guer@@ ri@@ llas .
only recently , her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before colum@@ nist , however , there is a long way until you can talk about an effective reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ atro@@ opers , who lived for many years in illegal camps , have been subjected to military rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock carried their weapons in themselves , now they have to integrate into life as civilians .
in turn , the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , strug@@ gled to life in constant fear and in some cases deep@@ ened hatred against guer@@ illa fighters , must now record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ nist had to close together and would help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages on former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighting to welcome them back in society .
the campaign of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ llas who should then be handed to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ aign
the idea for the letter was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates that took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need much more necessary .
he plane , he will continue to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent promise .
thus , the plan , letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , now find their place in society and establish itself a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story about a joint history of peace . &quot;
to date , more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i have never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ i traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC on how they had done earlier in order to counter the commands of their leader .
but this time they received no orders , but letters of sub@@ stit@@ uting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings to go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we handed the letters to the letter , a former fighter was led by the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ llas live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ llas who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed a M@@ GL pom@@ egran@@ ate , a le@@ thal weapon in the thorn @-@ Sle@@ eping .
and I asked him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I reply to a letter that somebody has written . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly tears of tears have walked on my che@@ eks .
I im@@ pover@@ ished him , and sat down beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive myself for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms .
till now , I have only learned how to handle weapons .
but now where peace is prev@@ ailing , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC arrived in a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how to develop social in@@ justice on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country more righteous .
for a goal of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who have never had seen hearing before and had no electoral law , and to recognise that people who were often seen as a monster , and hated even only people with beautiful feelings that were surrounded by their life &apos;s circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was made aware that after the dis@@ armament of peace would rule peace .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise to weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
now we use the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
this is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our Word , make our contribution , and offer sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . to those who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be forth@@ coming .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ et on the right of LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ community , is not only created over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual wife from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experience with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines in several months ago , after reports were published , which were printed , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who took susp@@ icious que@@ ens and raised them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt her childhood since her childhood , that she was a woman in reality .
when they grow up , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so that she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ ens had experienced by gender equality , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
for fear of her life she moved over to the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone , of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round about What@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a defect : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still escape the family , you s@@ mu@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key ab@@ ated in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances you were laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the doctor stood up and laid me in the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thank@@ ful for him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , they wrote - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they found absurd recei@@ v@@ ables : some said to me , I have to prove that I was up@@ set up without the streets ; others want I had not changed in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only evil , and Photos@@ hop .
I have bask@@ ets size C - what should I say on television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people said once to my mother on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the entire Republic humili@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a fro@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a rope around his neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window was a car with dark@@ ened wind@@ shield and a plate plate with a 95 .
after it was the third time it was clear to me that something la@@ zy was la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the number of license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to pay their names , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother , as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without record , without ID , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered at a fore@@ ig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you are in safety , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ ole . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , however , this is a table theme .
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements have I still wear in me .
so very I wish it too , this se@@ el@@ ian barrier cannot be overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I will actually give myself effort to look as the person remembers them from their past - so on my male form .
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I was talking to someone who gave a one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that while Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tortured during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , but also that all of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
so , my opinion , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood .
OC Media : are men still in this secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says that there would be no many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to settle Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are arrested there , so that you can present them as terrorists later .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , it seemed to be used specifically to radi@@ alize himself .
OC Media : is this now only a delay or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after having grown be@@ ard .
there have been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
and the so @-@ called Lord , that person was even when these people were taken away .
however , until now they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , so far there were no reports . we suggest that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already took place in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known around Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ zation , &quot; but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were sli@@ pped ; I had coloured eyelashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never changed a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people came there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an aff@@ ection : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; car@@ rot isn &apos;t about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say it often to children , if that are fun of sick .
OC Media : so they just kept their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased , and never sm@@ itten me .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ age stay ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking about mor@@ ality on mor@@ als .
he didn &apos;t talk about us , but rather on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change .
those who have landed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at yourself with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity now you go to ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still working as an activist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I agree with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ gers , I medit@@ ate them to hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t get a cent for that .
I have discovered these people myself , when I ab@@ dic@@ ated conc@@ essions .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ ig@@ ning .
so nature , that has purely nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth , that there is no moment@@ ary among them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have who , the Cab@@ ard@@ ine have the ones , the Russians also have they ; on the whole planet it does exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something .
I meet here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ able Muslims who walk to the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
do you know , many think about transi@@ tions of men who love men , and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a dec@@ eption .
these are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be precise , different living settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i , on August 27 , came the desper@@ ate situation of the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran that is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to come up for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who want to remain in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video played on YouTube , where he had lit the moments , after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the valley &apos;s subur@@ ban hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the doctors were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists warned that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all the family fathers that were hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of getting their families to feed their families and pursue a secure work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is located , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power , and 1925 great efforts made it to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the richest and valuable materials for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy still develops slowly , and the native population receives only little of this wealth .
she is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime refused to systematically mig@@ rate work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has built a number of tribes , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are surrounded .
these dam@@ s have only managed to manage the devast@@ ation of the region in the region , and to destroy local agriculture and pal@@ ms and pal@@ ms @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ vo@@ zi @-@ young@@ sters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activist with resi@@ dency in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ moral kill@@ ers among young Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse , the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ah@@ wa@@ z , ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab Dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the integration process :
since functional and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arabic labour force , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi will have access to working opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her living conditions outside your homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or so that even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated in the workplace , because speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , beat human rights activists before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world w@@ akes up and knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I identify with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ strations .
they are wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought good scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist , and why we generally , all femin@@ ists should be within .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education as men .
that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various sectors of life have stum@@ bled upon a glass blanket , and that discrimination based on gender are still cross@@ wise through the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is conscious and known .
I am convinced that I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black sor@@ rel women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community , or on black women in the LGB@@ T community ; if I mention , on which way we have been physically , se@@ el@@ ically and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists did not decide to mention many white femin@@ ists .
yet , however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to emp@@ tied their voices , and to sing &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , to sing my lord &apos; to obtain equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , a institutional form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we have been suspended black women in two times .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and origin of origin are less of earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant backgrounds are more often referred to the school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want to have all men , all males and all human beings , either skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can take myself as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman likes to consider un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , which relate to gender as well as on the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and I &apos;m not going to fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ il lam@@ ented in her speech in 1851 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a deser@@ ted and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m ref@@ using to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb the customs of customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer attempt to fin@@ alize the importance of skin color and sex . because some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to rever@@ t them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women more different gen@@ ces and spread themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself full and entirely of femin@@ ism and called me of the movement of Wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of a white @-@ feminist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women on our own shows and give us in the spher@@ es that are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book afri@@ ca wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , we can define ourselves on our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately invo@@ ke separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ dictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life neither passed , nor ignored , is still rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports un@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
within the context of an content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is again published again .
over the past 7 years , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or can@@ oe - with a special concerns through the Kurdistan Regional Region . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a that explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is involved in protecting and supporting the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq &apos;s documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of their work lies on persecuted , slightly larger sub@@ cultures and is characterised by using cooperative photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities that can tell their stories by their own way .

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ r@@ ein@@ ef@@ oot ) who is reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex partner who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship had been some time , and the police said , their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was given because of failure , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved her ad back .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women should see at all , in general , they do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities .
intu@@ ition and Statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system which does not sub@@ strate 3 @-@ of @-@ the laws : good approach , def@@ icient realization and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that do not even prove the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , these figures are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , for domestic violence , the Office At@@ tor@@ ney of 9@@ 600 ad@@ mits to domestic violence . at 70 % of them it went to violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads of domestic violence because of domestic violence . 86 % of ads came from women here .
in the advertis@@ ements 40 % of women said they were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , this statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women of female Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di there are only few of these crimes actually displayed . &quot; on each woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women will not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any woman who im@@ bur@@ se because of physical abuse , two women , who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is no separate off@@ ense , the prosecution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women will be murdered each year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay was documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent actions by men .

invisible abuse and an legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then , after that , it was supposed to be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today , Mariana 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious :
I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
when I read earlier this , I always thought that this only happens to be sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they dec@@ eive of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the ab@@ uses by Carlos Vera .
without names , she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mariana that they had fallen the so long of Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ uses at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner har@@ assed them abuse .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you , &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of ab@@ uses .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements with the authorities remained without any outcome and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a process against its former partner who developed into an in@@ consistent legal battle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it went mainly to money , power , and the influence of their former partner .
sh@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very well , but not applied .
the ad@@ missions of ab@@ uses is a way full of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ one L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain the fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent crime @-@ continu@@ ance and pun@@ ish harder as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ature was changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that they were afraid that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions may be banned , which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the initial bill was planned , the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process cost , which have to carry the victims of violence themselves , if they simply want to receive only ad and receive a safe accommodation to exp@@ ose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , abuse are seen as part of human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so violence should not be regarded as a little later .
those who are silent in view of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators are gone out .
we must restore so long , until mis@@ use is no longer valid .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified , however , among other things , a passage that was called for partners in cases of domestic violence to reconc@@ ile .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his victims .
the submission of the words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a large blow .

in Oman , independent media in Oman exposed to ban on a paper attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Secretary &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the Peru@@ vian authorities closed an independent Arab @-@ language daily Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison where he served a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and taken before the Court , however , was later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Sa@@ ï@@ d who came to power after he had set his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , who had revol@@ ted with a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ ass@@ al efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic intelligence , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , in@@ ad@@ ren@@ ders and human rights activists , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and more activists , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights a systematic and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , remember to express their views on the public matters of the country like corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and detention three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari won an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties holding hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . in this case there was corruption in the Judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of raising the Supreme Court of Justice in Oman , to raise a verdict in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the Committee of Directors , was charged by the ISS prior to the Special Department and was arrested in his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy chief editor of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed on an in@@ definite period after the information minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the trial in M@@ ask@@ at took place the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ excav@@ ation of the state &quot; .
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of inf@@ rin@@ gement of an audience and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a unanim@@ ous prohibition against the two journalists was rejected .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to one year prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after being found to use the use of an information network to spread the material that could pose a risk for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a b@@ ail was set in the amount of 5,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) and he was released in prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , and Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in exile of his six months prison sentence from the central prison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j still remains in prison , where he served his imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Security Council to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n newspaper . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper is subject to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister for Information received an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister delivered another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court , the publication of the paper .
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman the press has been hurt .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , include their operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisoned journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the anom@@ aly authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press freedom .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the British authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect the Press freedom in the Land and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights issues and journalists un@@ inhi@@ bited their right human rights labour and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including gr@@ ass@@ ent ch@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with his understanding
medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most critical needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need to be conducted on site medical research . there are two reasons for a lack in the offer of global health and vaccines that cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , is helping to establish its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he in@@ quired about HIV @-@ virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ed a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research . we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver , instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult , to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or move here , as financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work , which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous power supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion for the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the world , health care ( non @-@ transferable and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them .
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?

from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this entry of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports about solutions to environmental issues worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding the salad since the 1980 &quot; s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA @-@ ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was set only by its own acc@@ ru@@ by and the question as many sal@@ ts of sal@@ ts can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he realized that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ri@@ pped leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been applied for ever more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant @-@ bre@@ e@@ ders , environmental prot@@ ectors and experts ensure food safety will ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on is still looking for a salad , but he still needs longer since its work continues to continue with more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a rock bro@@ o@@ cks in a river , to whom I have to p@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we must do this now , but it &apos;s a bre@@ ach with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents have to go far too far .
and if they stand before the court , nobody can breed a new sage variety because all the characteristics are already patented . so he &apos;s doing so well as possible and tries to extract those features that he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use a material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement that is increasingly bigger in the United States and throughout the world . open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ eder ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at &apos;s variety of diving in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station and it is being tested there if plants can be grown in space .

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and did not be protected as intellectual property and are usable for plant bre@@ e@@ ders permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ e@@ ders can under@@ take to use that others can freely use of them far@@ med seeds .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to buy businesses and sell it . &quot; open source , bre@@ eder only allow others to breed their seed , to breed as their own varieties , and it will not immediately trigger two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many herbal pat@@ ties .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seeds have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection .
seeds is according to him a role in larger cl@@ am@@ ity such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use the latter not or only little to breed seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement did not deal with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of environmental sustainability , the most recent examples have to buy locally sour@@ ced vegetables , such as for example in pe@@ asant markets , should also know that the way is far@@ med as this vegetable is being bred .
dietary sovereign without seed su@@ pre@@ macy is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to ensure other their seed remains free to provide . thus , in contrast , these are to be patented , seeds and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gen@@ pool is due to the increasingly abundant spiritual property rights in plant material , which is thus always restricted , un@@ ce@@ asing .
Claire Lu@@ by , the director of O@@ ss@@ i , employed in her PhD work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all back@@ ot@@ ings are protected as intellectual property , making it either us@@ eless for plant @-@ bre@@ e@@ ders either .
for other plants there are not yet some estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass @-@ based plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented than salad or carrots .
a Question Of The Vis@@ i@@ als
plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - of such , by which their taste or their color improves up to such , because they prosp@@ er in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patches on plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders are decl@@ ining by more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions are much worse than ever .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company established themselves for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts the view that intellectual property purchases other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result .
such protection doesn &apos;t prevent innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on is looking for a different way to wait for another 20 years until a patent inf@@ lic@@ t , and certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long for plants to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , we would have lost the battle .
but the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have been a gener@@ alized well , and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers &apos; work easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
a total of Mort@@ on interfer@@ es in the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them , and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US State Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of breeding breeding : &quot; he who ch@@ ases a variety , also breed its own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation , are needed , are breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very gent@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than such as Monsanto are ) patents , it can survive the most smaller seed companies , either refuse to survive the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant @-@ bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders would be ultra @-@ innovative : &quot; it looks as if I do with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ourselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you can be protected for 20 years before competition , with which it simply makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed sector . the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come on &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German Organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( rules for the bre@@ aches differ from country to country , absent because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not simply being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventional far@@ med plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is necessary to implement the Member States , the Patent Office to implement these new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , in the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies across East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ ching seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed Systems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program for Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed Systems &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for seed systems that will fall for the scheduled start next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represents the view that farmers have to come to seed , to exchange and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products .
in the report , the importance of a variety of food supplies with seeds for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a link by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been considered , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to discover people that are more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government shut down the website of the Arabic network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported on this .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities were sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region .
the Arabic network for Human Rights Information lead - despite this attack and the re@@ mo@@ cking of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend their goal , so it was never so difficult as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking , and not to admit our task . we hope to keep our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera for &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides the HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ nist and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not available websites and media .
now , the blog was established to circum@@ vent the apparatus of the Egyptian government , the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider that is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and took a video as the police ra@@ ged physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights conditions in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada remarks on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to un@@ lock is very old , however , in the era of del@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to conv@@ ey me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , pre@@ load of the national Security Council , the lock blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an impact if only a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) open Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 pages . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
in addition , AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers to be possible through internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th we saw how to offer blocking of websites , V@@ P@@ N@@ s , we began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content , and filtering the content that they might have access to Egyptian users .
in addition , the situation is conce@@ aled in addition , that the cargo decisions are taken behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using them in front of the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and whom will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil , with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard illustrations .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violence in the middle of the crisis in the middle of the economic crisis and in a divided financial situation reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become everyday , and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual break , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we did not close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor , announced that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper declared that there are 8@@ 43 countries following the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro in 8@@ 43 countries .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , even though it can be used , gr@@ asp the police , which first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
is the designation &quot; War &quot; more than it benefit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l ar@@ gues that the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira asser@@ ts the violence as the &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion on a jus@@ tification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to take account by the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as in the analysis of the military approaches in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and an historical and self @-@ counterfeit investment of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of non@@ violent death . for several years , the U@@ PP , however , according to several reports about the poor con@@ greg@@ ations and repression of the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Charle@@ aux from one of his article published in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio not comply with the criteria for the name &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws a serious consequences for the people after themselves .
because this requires the state to use funds and ways that are typical for a war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ harm &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted spher@@ es . &quot;

to stay alive : learn Syrians , to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , Homs , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 is particularly affected by the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those of rebels have been controlled areas outside Damascus under siege , what led to that inhabitants have been reli@@ ed on locally or through tunnel and control points .
traditional food products such as meat has become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to conventional , in Syria , they are extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they are extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is extremely rare for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the head of the project , Nabil , said to the French News Agency AFP :
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ near the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to conv@@ ey 125 families of knowledge to the plant@@ ing of mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is based on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity to 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , fuel manufactured using plastic are used to supply the generators to supply the power supply .
Dr. L@@ eila told global Vo@@ ices that they began to test their quality from the regions of the region before they checked their quality and , if they are not suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a bowl . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ catering ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) are used for the extraction of new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women working home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .

Portuguese MEP and justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ ested on 21 October in many neighbour@@ hoods in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ed in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two people died , and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande was a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite imag@@ ery , in Portugal alone , around 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
Portugal is still burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why the civil protection was unable to interv@@ ene to the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al provided by the federal government of Portugal , the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o declared :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão the streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy in June could happen again , as the streets became very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in locations linked to a high risk of fire .
a further proposal on the whale @-@ form that had brought the government following severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tioned by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstac@@ le to investment .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applicant has had an open door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads to João Sor@@ val in the same article by P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made it attentive to spread great surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , according to the fires of this type .
regarding these problems , the site of the Portugal &apos;s civil protection must be found in Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was set up in 2015 by the developers of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade , and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so decisive that the servers followed up with the on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users , who followed the fires , not counted : it counted more than half a million requests .
even the founders asked for help :

refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke off between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afgh@@ ani for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother never said it at that time , she knew she would not see her son very long , maybe even more .
during the morning of dawn , the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the po@@ p@@ res .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the H@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , was killed by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly trans@@ mitting .
the Taliban continued for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara famous Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ aul . the work was heavy and made it ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar that were heavier than himself , in order to make himself his living .
back then as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we put n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we don &apos;t freeze it at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made themselves ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran solely through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day of food in needy .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are cat@@ astrop@@ hic in the country .
the rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recep@@ tive centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission centre , if they officially put an application for asylum - which can go after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers for months .
until then , people who have no money for a vacation rental , have either reli@@ ed on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
and so it was A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ miss@@ able life of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had its entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good , that he opened a second hostel after a while , and a whis@@ per@@ lover was opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 since the first time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy according to official estimates .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afghan @-@ driven companies , including cutting eries , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants even praised in the Italian media for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea for his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the staff are mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ ani , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , are far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail , and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must have the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and preser@@ ving techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
citizen report : bills of Egypt enable social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ural report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft bill , which sees that users can only use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after the completion of the authority under the authority of its full name as well as their ID number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the end of a criminal case .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members of parliament , is present at the processing and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the deputy proposed a legislative proposal , in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced to the pre@@ ten@@ tion of the President or a high civil servants .
Egyptian right is already fir@@ med . Egyptian law is already fir@@ med . under the law proposition a such deed would act with prison and fin@@ es , the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ tions .
in addition , this would under@@ score political climate , in which the right to free expression of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he had demonstr@@ ating Egyptian polic@@ emen who had demonstr@@ ating violence against prot@@ esters who had led to the military put@@ sch of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protests were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because , according to human rights groups , he failed to put the def@@ endants from prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ burden of e.g. weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists have interro@@ gated board documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which expressly supports a controversial law bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption of accused Am@@ nesty .
this document released on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , raises a light on how the prehistoric plans look for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the designation of its sources under Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press store which journalists protects the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the district court .
will China force the user of social media to present their identity ?
according to new rules of information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the user of social media in China do require approval before they write messages in social media or share .
in addition , regulations will also be stated that registration must be required with the full recur@@ ring name .
analysts believe that by the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks , it is un@@ clear until now , how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese net citizens have proposed in the social media to selective these regulations only selective to protect civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; see you in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may , the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia locked the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ Nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat tran@@ scri@@ be to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of the Information Fo@@ unding . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government a list of online services leading to the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for removing content and en@@ force them on request for suspension of user data .
these websites are currently listed websites like V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ classic ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court dispos@@ es of Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court disp@@ osed from Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the numbers that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime and Communication was closed , the site was locked because they collabor@@ ate to &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to raise a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked the website . it is thus , besides China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .

after this week , the government of Britain is located in a targeted public consultation on a targeted surveillance collection , to monitor the Internet service providers to monitor communications communications in real @-@ time and make @-@ out programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications company and secret services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
