<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year, I would now live for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly known because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless presenter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud, the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US was yet reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottling.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells what he thinks about how a former colleague put it off, and publicly declared its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won by the republican election was the highest number ever reaching out of the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters in accordance with the people I met in Phoenix, during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic programme, people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr that her life fights for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and wormwood and my colleagues to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me a lot of my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and they embodied by them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump got his way to the nominated republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out to be the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they shared either his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, I broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people have agreed, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful, suggesting an inability to understand those who deal with a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most knows, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country, which she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly remember the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to find a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "rebellion against all other ethnicions," word play from white in watching the white and whiplash, which means the great Van Jones "name, has just killed what America has made such a great way.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the globe appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose two presidents, twice the son of a Kenite, whose story itself, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your United States? "Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your United States? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your United States?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and silent "NEHEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children do not leave their love for music by garbage?</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments," by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="68">Image of Flickr User OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in Oaxaca in the province of Oaxaca, together with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-colony ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La Banda de Música (music banker) has now been playing in the community: one of children and adults, existing symphony orchestra which has found their musical instruments a way to overcome the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuses and the band violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI believes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shining eyes and play in the Trubel you day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music made of trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recyclable waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recompeted instruments made up of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez has begun to turn parts of the query into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the first time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same spot the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced by trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of restored material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational acting from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work successfully fighting illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine showing specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs within the context of an agreement with Global Voices to joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing by illegal fishing waters before the other coast of Africa visited Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">In this way, East African countries were uplifting and slightly inclined to welcome a lawsuit of this kind in its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves rapidly against the ship. they refused to take one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who were just refused," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing industry. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and persecuted." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects against criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are six countries who drove the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they share information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to increase. this is illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species should be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems may harm the delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, the actions occurred in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists of licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as such as suspicious driving routes - such as those that hinder a ship will wipe his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a fish licence, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can deny the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can't sell their cargo to their cargo, and that they could even be forced to use of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant firm that is involved in the struggle against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The first platform was created to win an estimated $20 million to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of the illegal fishers that penetrate East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifies phasienames, fish protected species and fish in nature conservation area.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they are targeted the lack of international collaboration and make the weaknesses of a no longer organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship could say illegal and a country could then say" "" "you mustn't walk to the port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale asshole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front will work.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks, which had distributed licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found whispering ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the" "" "organised crime" "", "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that can help FISH-i to give suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly evolving, helps to raise the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishers use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO who also deals with fisherman data and provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be addressed by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why the Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find discriminating ships with a larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations really influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that can offer satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that's just sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and to bundling their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project running in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detective, but also shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have been fishing earlier without licenses and could hardly expect consequences, so they know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the members involved in FISH-i have now increased a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats and more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board trawl nets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these achievements. "the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries," says Kiilu. "" in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. now they are fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH i. "" With safety, the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country left his first major triumph in October: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and have been banned by towing nets.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also banned in prohibited water, which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative study to the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the government of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezolans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations ran over the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the withdrawal of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-west of the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country deteriorates continually, which makes the everyday use of the Venezolans through an acute lack of food and pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw Nicolás Maduro as the opportunity for a fundamental change in the minister of the current President Nicolás Maduro, however, blocking a reelection of the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government's context in its latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to give the country the opportunity to reinvent its institutional structures and close a new governance.</seg>
<seg id="164">To join the elections of the National Assembly, the campaign against President Nicolás Maduro was forced to join the National Assembly to join the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a twelve-hour strike began to join the National Assembly as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, on November 3, should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, a Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is being published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, Quijano said, in the context of the big La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the brush, the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he held the secret secrecy for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't notice that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not know that my father was a thief, folks, and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was an endless military officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret service division 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archival absorption.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quixano, the oppressors that is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who witnessed the magnitude of atrocities which he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent about his child, and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photograph and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="221">Pass just that they don't lead you one day, and then I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Guard Party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be obedient.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had raised me.</seg>
<seg id="226">In the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university closures, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda amaterial, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he participated in the second time he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barrack, in cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just all possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little wrap in a blanket, and ordered me to wear it on the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down, and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I ran in, and saw a couch, tortured in man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a fieldbed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they sealed it at the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just caught there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They captivated a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured him with water and pursued it a load of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The contention in it was horrible... as a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell instantly and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that those people were killed "</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father participated in the work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were tied with handcuffs and carried the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilians who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses where naked people were lying down on the face - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit, and were killed by soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of deferred.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war" - how they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was even at the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war yield gains a bajonett or maybe military rabbit which one is fought against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then that is no war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I was always asked how my father, the director of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand that.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I answered: and you who sticky the cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded with anger, struck me, and cried,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and compile you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">That was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo from that time, on which I wore a jacket and a roller pullover from wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a fellow-mate for this crime. I answered, no problem, they can lay down for the burden of what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to tell.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last vile act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I'm older, I feel repentance.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if one has only children, you can recognize the value of a life.</seg>

<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you were exekatted during the dictatorship of people. but why should the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children lead us?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with her home whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have just been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why would their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Were these people not even families where they could be delivered to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last vile act, which one can do to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was re-introduced, they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and somewhere there - no idea where. "you never find something," my father said.</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'I have seen how you killed men! '</seg>
<seg id="308">To make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea to display my father, arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something about me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed men!</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was on electronic ads in the entrance area and to read in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator of Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local loids so attentive.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto, the Kyoto, released in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawless English translation was initially removed. the name "martial" (German: "terrific motorists") was later replaced by the appropriate, if there were also grammatically not correct (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in Kyoto preapologized for the translation errors. furthermore she explained that the error had already been included in the text, which they had received from translators and that the translation was not tested on their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people felt by insufficient correction (the translation) on our other side," "" "said the Police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-cast news set something more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorist in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of motorist drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents, which are nationwide in accidents, but certainly to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1.941 of a total of 19,460 have been caused by seniors. this corresponds to a percentage of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">By doing so, their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The reputable ones did not appear in the published version of the article comments to the light that show the prejudices a few Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">For transferring two important capabilities: passive language skills, to understand the text-text and active language skills to transfer it into the destination language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in native languages. generally, the belief that translators in the target language - do not have to be in the starting language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">This is how a French native language should translate from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ a collaborator with English as a mother tongue who could produce translations into English. this may be due to an understanding of the sucking, cost-jumps or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees, have not yet been firmed. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English than the best, are made to translators, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation, show that this technology can still not replace a human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weightful English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that are often used by T-shirts or bags, are not used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be unacceptable or at least harmless. but of great companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto's Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the Portals "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users, that they don't have access to online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the Internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were not yet accessible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcaster transmited photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by opposition groups, which by the Government of Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive, and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled, and recommended the Usern, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensr: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages Venezuelan providers are locked once again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as vivoplay are popular in the Venezolanists with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitated over protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with purpenalties and closure, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, since the Commission saw it as a "Call for Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I have filed myself at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfilov later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online broadcaster. this also affects the website where the National Assembly carries their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research studies of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that local Internet service providers had to take advantage of DNS. this is a technology that will answer the DNS-server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server does not answer or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elisoliv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">When VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was smitten, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV returned to the show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: thereby, the Venezolanern of access to multimedia reporting on the country's current events will always continue.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices with friendly authorization of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuanique Caen" ("Flying cows, decaying schools"), processed and published by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, in which she was not living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Just before her studies at the University, she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride in her. she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, it is called the more than 46.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfer their underage-old son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to afford more days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you can't raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This as Criadazgo, practice, is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In doing so, she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witness, reacted and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude, that is vaccinated the criadiers, guaranteed to be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">It is the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the faith that they will improve their education, improve their position in society and "something from itself" can be translated to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which accuses the girl with faith, justifies that she would give someone a chance that would not have any education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl harassed the girl, his family will only experience many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience them.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in paraguan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent stripes. in short, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the population of the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living in their home in Vaquería, a small village with 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira proposed as long as with a stick to Marín, until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported over the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cribta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They noted the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together in protest petitions and demanded that there were no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couples and almost 60 civil society demanded an independent investigation.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before the court, the case of Carolina Marín would be landmark, if for the first time in history, a case of criadazgo comes before the court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas are not only exploited as labour force, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when Farbik, who worked in her father, had to register and lost their father's work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and began to buy money on the street or on the market of sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent to the capital Asuncion in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">It had to divide the time so that you stayed with learning still time.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, she purged the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they work with learning, the more leisure it had.</seg>

<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if he is accepted by Parliament, users and social media must be registered in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law, a place would then be established, which is instructed, citizens and citizens to share a permit to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, user and users have to register in the site of their real names and personnel number numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">Will it be missed to do this, so this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraphs and support in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others through a voice, video-based and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set when it is assumed that Egyptian authorities are not able to impose the registration for users and users who do not register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation on stage of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they have violent physical public and private spaces, it may also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to carry it to a trial process.</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan's northeastern Iraq, the animal lady Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the astostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wilderei, loss and fragmentation of its habitat and as they always find less spoils.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of Leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows up in the video, "is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards in fact is small and goes to zero. as the team has therefore established that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, breaks out Raza in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still has the region's rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March, 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, who had reached the progress made up in the last six years, had reached the life of those who had been affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had been triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a common prefectures in Japan's Northeast, who had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to vanish because the tsunami had filled whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima Prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone, some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view that progress has been achieved for six years, to rebuilding the life of the local population.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese restoration authority as well as a survey of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (of the city, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">According to Iwate, 75 percent of such houses are finished, while Fukushima is the final light for Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">While still, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behnfswald, evacuated by shelters (marceterisu juutaku) resettlement to the final replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelfswald.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima still live in emergencies, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation of evacuees were moved after the disaster in Behelfswald, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and daily life in the three prefectures of the prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their gateway to December 2016, which constitutes nearly 98 percent of schools in three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial building in the three prefectures are much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation once again, in Fukushima alone, only 30 percent of the fishing harbors have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have been dragged.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic bomb, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are in the "nuclear wave zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered quickly again, but here Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again to 90 per cent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the daily newspapers led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuation by. she asked them about the booth of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey through to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the resident population has taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disasters associated with disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima was not only forced to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, ever experiencing Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of the 160 000 evacuation of Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, something more than 23,000 people had been resettled back to Fukushima, which had been resettled in permanent sparity houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation areas are still more than 50 years old. they are in proper ability to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences appear to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, we often see that a more unites than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they demand our prejudices to expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately became very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat subjects that often get less attention when they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over speech and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Egherman talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Torana Macias talks about the time that she has worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and suffered several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors performed him this Saturday and moved it into an artificial coma now.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás in memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he had been sabotaged the Occupy Movement in secondary schools. and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked on the intensive care centre, after he was attacked by a policeman, who struck him with a punch stock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police officers</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to the demonstrators last Friday to demonstrators against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were put at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">S & D Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police via speakers to abandon violence against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media are spun up by using the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window of windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a broken glass window to meet with a photo of their title pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo favored a cover story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken windshield than the protests of thousands of people who are serving the defense of a specific cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognize, if you are strictly against any form of non-damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism" get a absurd, uneventful meaning, and the typical violence against the military police are intercepted with the title "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The abducts of forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane seeds included the doors to the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Municipality Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no notable sugar beest in the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were painted in the sugar cane plants.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its investments until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other signed and commutes daily to the factories, that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldatenvelopan, opened every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane seeds in the eastern region, which after long inactive time are in operation because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds you precisely that in Mañalich the sugar factory was preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry resistance already withstands the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, Ineffsufficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the poor harvests are no more recent.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarcane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive, they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugarcane plantations and the growth crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar is between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "Agriculture institutions" published by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar supply would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will go into history with safety," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the lactation of a total of 98 sugar mill factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene is known as a soldier on the closing of the factory, the word that he repeats most," "" "deceit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all of those questioned are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first school year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">Officially, documents were officially distributed to documents related to the parts that would be removed, the addressee, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulam Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any disapproving.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-down factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still operating sugar mill factories."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in his will to disclosing the factory, whose construction he helped, was involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">In every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there were no alternatives for the workplaces and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas that factories not have been in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the Municipality of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, that many things change, but not always better when a factory is closed.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young Nations communities in the whole of Canada are busy with topics that are important for them. they are doing with hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, part of the N'we Jinan-Tour offer mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres, in order to bring youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will ensure that the young participants in discussions such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" or whatever the meaning comes in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the School 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in WestCanadian, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not cleared.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, as important for obtaining traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, even though the young people are unable to master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-hop Group, who gave them a Strophone in the Eastern-Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookside of N'we Jinan is available the rophe into transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>

<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is located exactly on the menu, will be found near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (martial arts, "Plastic Products of the dishes") of each food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at this plastic dishes, and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to manufacturing this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi District Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that made the German Film filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them again. however, a new trend is transformed into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">The Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now available in special sale: new with plastic shredded mobile tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shots fridges for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the Essentifications is increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an kaisen-don (a popular travel cycle with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have made this part for the Tokyo Exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, who are holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of a growing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikenura or salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can cheating my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and molybanders from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skimmrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to know more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to exposure to the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpurse.</seg>

<seg id="746">"for the victims of the fight against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug dealers" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly occur only in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Kartells, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the streets or to the municipalities that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every corpse, behind every bone fund, in the hundreds of bones, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican News portal Animal Político has called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with the drug trade,") to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The implications are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers, and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how much life has changed") just tell these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is searching for secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only a single day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task before we have made us go, and after the graves we have loved to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13, he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never arrived. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment they have no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't pay it out because they demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who pose a fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on readers of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never look at normal as normal, regardless of what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of the disease and sensor journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I arrive every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures that are actually only from a textbook for criminals or from the specialists of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It spends me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who had disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers), when it is tall. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is, when would they mourn those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of people is incredible to me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour was justified that they were "settled."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about that they will be spared of such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the capital District: how a family with threats became plundered." in this, it describes as armed criminal month for the month of money from their business until they were not only destroyed the business, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain, it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She joined her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will dispossess or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deepest root feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn how to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement at the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells us to teach himself how to make an egg boiled, potatoes brewed, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and that had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has already passed two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders and the Government of Public Safety and the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the public prosecutor's office 3103 murders were counted, equivalent to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are some hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in the face of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who do not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal político is set up in 2015 with the objective of portraying the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the past four decades, in understandable manner.</seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" from Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and the pages where he is linked, include pictures where violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment where it comes to lifting a rumor or to unmask a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after the first time emerged? content in social media, whether true or unexpected, tends to pass on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been fully exploited, tragedies to beep tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong clutch of image and event - "false description" or "false Context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our demand for pictures too.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank-car crossed the site Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded. 230 people came into life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second biggest country had been neglected and thus devastated. the streets in the region became more dangerous plainers, which were difficult to befall.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">We described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a movie near, which was full of people who witnessed the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and pertinted corpses scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Mehrere photos of the incident make the grey scenes this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Up is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow bodies, which are rounded up during the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But this is not the end of the story.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was captured several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but they seem to be attributed to the related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="837">On January 3, 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the dragatory villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">However, the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one stayed back to count corpses," said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many have been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the Boko Haram's attempt to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture appeared on the DR Congo again, as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass strikes.</seg>
<seg id="852">A step further, personal comments, such as the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange came in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, the UN described those who could flee, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following, which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an acidic news page, which falsely said that President Myanmars Than have said, monks and politicians had participated in the Assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to record these information.</seg>

<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far information limits can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse picture search engine with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 Pictures, which are very similar to the discussed image from the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Than existed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article has been updated in 2014 and this release is still included in this release.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now soldered, the Catholic near the news page Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the picture is not of the killings, but it claims that it was a similar one-like attack.</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture appeared in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 in circulation, the El Pais attempted to oppose it into Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The DR Congo picture appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in Paris and the proposal on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took this event, which took place in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was swept up for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times kneaded). but the messages that were connected with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message was recorded by a "Pater Juan Carlos Pascal" about the Nigerian massacre was in circulation, discussion forums, as described here on Vietnamese and declared it to the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Clarinet Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a erroneous use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, Aggregators and pages in the following countries (based on portfolio in grey), are also no longer traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time- / date stamp exist in the webcrawler and united them to Muslims with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which was first published clearly according to the original disaster of 2010, the image is probably probably a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (irradiation) that move through this posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murdered victims of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when reading these images could not give any longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who unintentionally share the share of drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misleading and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorns it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of non-violent images was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that, to detect the rejection of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that nonviolent images, readers, and viewers assume the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which interact as violent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some more violent representations in the news media, it is fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimented because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to reconsider thoroughly about situation in which a picture is somewhat suggests, but in context of context or totally abused type can be used.</seg>
<seg id="940">An investigation of false assurances should be considered as an international investigation as well.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo of Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name UnTranslatable (e.g. incomprehensible) endeavoured to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these incomprehensible words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish brake).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resists stubbornly to every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation, and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole period in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu's language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba yourself for your parents in recognition of how to make you endeavor for yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsettle language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that you feel after having grown in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence us how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguist on this page would like to publish and show more of these "unparalleled" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1000">We are located in a sea of umbrellas and people, some keep the iconic picture of a woman with headscarf, bound from an American flag, others will fight against Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1001">My girlfriend looks at me and says, "These things concern not you," or? "why, because I am not Muslim?," I ask.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already led this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People, with whom I work or people who have known me for years, separate me - the Sahar that they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has set up in their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They muslify me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We recognize ourselves to be a Muslim, in different kind. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims, that are not fit there, discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Unformized will be decapitated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">What pictures come in a sense when you think of it?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I was now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western idea religion Rumis was deleted, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a big part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists of Muslims in the reductionist images of Muslims, which has been colonial books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing picture language is determined by the dark men that you should fear and the exotic woman who should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The landmark of Palestinian-American scientists Edward Said put the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these images are even further developed today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I saw how this powerful, erroneous narrative dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries in the last three decades, while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are encouraged to bear their headscarf in public buildings and avoid sudi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same medal.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exercises his "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This powerful narratively weakened Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It is over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans, which were brought down with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has deeply impressed our collective pretensioning strength, often sighting men and children become the objective of anti-mic attacks and seizures.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives, helping us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And "" "" "" "and my industry has failed to certify the narrative of the 1.7 billion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of "religious group in America."</seg>
<seg id="1040">More than one-third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1046">Back then, when Khan thinking about the world's Skylines, my parents were undisputed Muslims and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1047">But am I undisputed Muslim and American?</seg>
<seg id="1048">Sometimes, if people ask me why I don't eat pork, I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my handsome handkerchiefs who carry all Muslims with respect - "from respect to Peppa Wutz."</seg>
<seg id="1049">I jesting, we do not wear all handkerchiefs with us.</seg>
<seg id="1050">We don't need to be theological expert in order to be "Muslim," or almost always to be selected for additional safety checks at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists who make efforts to fight widespread lies on Islam.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These lies are produced by a well-tasted Islamophobia, think tanks and experts for counterfeit information which is our already flawed picture of what a Muslim is; or what Islam is, manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Because of the stories we tell and because of the kind in which we tell it, Islamophobia in more than just a foreigner, who plucked the headscarf with a woman.</seg>

<seg id="1061">I was born to be Muslim, but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old, in a temporary mosque in the basement of a presbyterian church in New York.</seg>
<seg id="1062">If social scientists describe religious life, they rely on the following terms: faith, conduct and affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1063">My Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible, but they are there.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor, my neighbor, my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that will separate our houses.</seg>
<seg id="1065">She would see the evening ritual with my daughter, when I kept them in my arms, and you would be called the Arab-verses to protect the Koran and called the Quls.</seg>
<seg id="1066">I repeat three times each of them.</seg>
<seg id="1067">Therefore, I ask you to be protected from evil, the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see.</seg>
<seg id="1068">My Muslim faith is possibly not always visible, but my Muslim supplements are always part of my shadow.</seg>

<seg id="1074">To be Muslim, as they taught me to refer to God, Allah Mian what God means, my only Lord.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We must uncomfortable ask ourselves according to the role of his, conscious and unconscious of the "other" as it did my girlfriend and I think we have a new future in which we have no presidents, while having already bombed countries and "to other-made" people, go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban freedom</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytellers count, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in its original language is an answer to this.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has been conducted since 2015 events, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided, if we do cities, accept diversity - safe rooms, in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "Listen is often connected to understand" "" "check out these events instead" "" "listening to feeling, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers ask her story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their depiction are that the listeners will slip on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story of storyteller Rassidatou takes the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the bunny and the pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fork, John Nyamusara is asked, "How is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of the included:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were quite with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities and organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can join TLS in order to organize their own storyteller performances.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for state debt of state debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a retrial of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march was launched at the puertorian capitol, the capital building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizenship) and the Okomenian church of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the remuneration of debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians, bankers and government agencies are responsible for the debts of their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial testing and an management committee without personal interests in public debts, with a solid, our working conditions of the respective remuneration that acts in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt, which is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not invade their retirement pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the state of an integral part of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socio-economic development, a law governing state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrically-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi is known for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporters and members continue to continue their freedom and remember the contributions that he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that will be hosted in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Income (The Cost of Freedom: a collective replica).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published in the last year, has been released here, contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on site to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and make some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet-volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the list of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have not seen any information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family to provoke him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporal beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and attorney Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken part on the basis of a "strictly secret" of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place and state remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of bass-cultural prototypes was more predicting than the work that he began around in 2005 with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayside of several civilians and merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel wasn't able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything about this architecture, not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripping in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a proxy, which she wrote in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him, and he translated them from the Arab into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose my reflection in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers, no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of prisons</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I dringe in every detail your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I wear the passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say empty</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to weep and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">Passing a year, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still in the cage's cage</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassel's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of protests in 2011, Bashar al-Assad's regime has disappeared for more than 65,000 people in the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption was sentenced to previous post by corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1255">The Mozambique reacted with wrath on a corruption case, when a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state machine in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the arrest of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 along with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for the disappointment of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Rat Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and promptly called his relocation into the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a position of the General Attorney General of the Republic, who accepted the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, to refer to his old posts, as the company did not fully comprehend a disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not like this action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, brief CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned to the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Imagine a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take in mind is that the company should have a disciplinary proceedings against the contradicts.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company kept silent, however, and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be an advisor, after he was sentenced to prison and served half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has approved to be integrated into the company that he helped damage harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young mosaic and student of political science in Brazil, the director says no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he did not believe it, I can't believe it was rewarded with such a way that the state has already received such massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and serve to the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead allowed himself to the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza did the state as a handsome of the inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, who is invited and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy has been rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent President, but also as sharp as sharp as sharp as a sharp and - incidentally - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of its most famous oral images, when he confirmed that "an ambitious person is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person is changing, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is the same as criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years old and arrived free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today he sets him the company, with which he was gelding, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Selected αences (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to dt.: @ truth) states that crime in Mozambique is paying off:</seg>
<seg id="1285">In fact, in # Mosambitious thief and minister of the # Frelimo, is paying off. # Diodino Cambaza, to the long-term imprisonment, returns to # Airports of Mozambique - Emildo Sambo (@ EmildoSambo) May 11, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1286">Facebook has blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means a chickpea or spyfish.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the background of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to assign up to human indian origin or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or that of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely abrasive connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself is not calling on an automatically Hasspronunciation.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts who have discussed the use of the word or expressed a doubt for his use to be expressed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same characters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spherical), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookbook Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">One post of my friends was erased today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way if she knew how he could lint his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hire is the opinion that it will be more radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical that Facebook has to be analytical that it dissolves all the posts that were suspected to spread racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filly the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism does not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, is carefully to analyze and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (palette knife).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dirty nationalists, the hate language disseminate a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is a powerful signal to everybody, the hate language does not like to spread the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often going to start a catch- and mouse game, with the user of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete its posts, when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I gave the liking, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours because the post "" "" the Facebook community "" "" did not speak. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a number of people away from people who have no negative intentions or simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the Post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more than expected on the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask Council:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words, only hatred will bring hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems like if they have started this without local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "Insencurry" have been prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they do not tried to rectify the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only a little more respect for the 15 million use they would have a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has received a lot of spoilt by users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hasspronunciation to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that are not contained in Hasspronunciation, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch a pea curry dish and watching an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try whether Facebook contains the mail which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who used social networks to extend their votes and their influence, increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks may also preheat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where there were fighting between Muslims and Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out the balancing Hassaries on his burmese sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of using the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running, rather in context than upon code focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The childcare is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously decided to offer a law which aims to ban this practice, so that it is now wise at age 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the adultery, some members were noted in practice, and in May 2016, it came to a huge public outcry (IRO), a group, the representatives of the various religious groups in the country, that the state should not interfere with the state that the state should not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contract partner of the UN Child Labour Convention, the minors of persons under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married in the age of 15, Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical significance confirmed that from 1997 to 2007, more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements, who endeavors to abolish laws for children, followed by the foot and rejoiced with great support. no doubt they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guides, for instance, had no concerns to say the critics of the children, they ought to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition intended for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts, whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the Opposition and an independent that could be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would take him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country agrees and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators issued a status update on Facebook that Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he had decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to children.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Dear Francis, who was a member of the ministry of education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary sense, used the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's care is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">During Abel Jackson's opinion, it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says: real news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The bill has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law is noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The holier age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the amendment of the Ehegesetz was today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and were present 35 by the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MPs, who were against the law, agreed for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Children care is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childmarriageischildi.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have deposited him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congrats. congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Thanks to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to take court steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to resolve his promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a supporters of the law said it was quite clear when Maharaj wanted to proceed against the law, most social media users were desirable to go into the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of speaking the discussion so commonly, in a way that only panic and imony may cause it to talk about the state in our bedrooms that it may be abused to them that they may be abused by large, hard-slanted men that are misused against them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a court case against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children's children are legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they say.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers cast off the office of the prosecutor before nationwide protests at the Russian National Day</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the news, which was posted on Sunday morning at the website of the district Yaroslavl.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coincides with the day of Russia - the Russian national day - the French national hero of the district Yaroslavl was hacked. hackers left a funny message left at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Or we'll bring you in jail instead of Dimon. "</seg>

<seg id="1390">By using web sites, Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content once more</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation on January 18, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey has now locked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle of based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more evident, how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Students as well as reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniquent Internet users are used to use changing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been locked out by Wikipedia, just as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society was held at Harvard University, finding regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform released all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. computer-host links), which is not based on the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost reports IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to complete snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is a possibility to read the contents of decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the www.wikipedia.org website.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step was run independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansizpe.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar MirrorPages that is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One is accessing another URL, which is not the original. that which one can see is by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server leads the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if these are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server, which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to bear a camera, and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepton to bring Nepal on international stage to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland is right next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that drive the attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) invited me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was once and I immediately began to knead pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know, for he stood by face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb anything from the opinion of sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was in the darkness at home, when suddenly the King of the boy appeared. he sits immediately, we see and he stares me through the sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otter in the Bardia National Park recordings of Otter. up to 12 days until he was able to take a tiger and take six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of an content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with great care, to address the name of their husbands, or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use an pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women to respect the husband due to social pressure, and fear of consequences should they accuse the norm, these practice will receive life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a placebo court and violated her family and the village community after having addressed a preheated relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives, also not even named among men, is also common among men. however, they have far less supplements to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main feature of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them, to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and sets itself for the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices, such as children's marriage to the network of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and they simultaneously made the murals of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing the Rohini in their discussion round was women who did not call their husbands at name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To address the name of their husbands, an attempt to reckon all obligations and never questioned them will never be questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman has respected her husband and wishes a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't enter this will be regarded as a reclisant, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this discussion round about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini who has never named her husband had never mentioned in the name, at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini is telling:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first Discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant in telling the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married since 30 years, and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Breeding of a centuries-old tradition, in which she married women the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini is telling:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was going astray during the whole practice; another distray decided to allow the entire fruitless frustration against him and his family to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline of adrenaline, having broken with an ancient breach, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at supper before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">She was afraid as her mother-in-law, she was afraid, saying that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in terms of less understandable and the situation took place in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the sucking of the cnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinok-red dot if he would like it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard thereon to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women didn't stop completely with it, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the Discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with each Discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about who could listen to what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their lives, their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang talking about things which they had never made thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I have also made known about some things, for example, as our identities linked to our husbands, never spoken as honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talk about the concept of honour and, as it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only bore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them this is okay, but some wanted a sage-Kurta, a wide shirt above a trousers, they did not have a weed.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of its own coat election, morals associated with Saris and much more, dingggelte Rohini their own couple Kurtas (upper inhibitor) into a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months have already changed a bit, Rohini confirms that things come slowly in the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps until now.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a couple of times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion lub know that changes they would like in their life - like the feiling around more freedom of movement or its own wardrobe - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">As they give each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also here.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if any woman walks in the club to home and other people tell about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories, which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo had passed in international community attention after his lawyer ended at the end of June, that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (State of State) after being involved in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Lius case as "an internal matter," he says it as "not required to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, permit to vacate or allow a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A speaker, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should have pressure to provide a treatment abroad within Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway went into the Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government believes that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations have only continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to relocate the salmon trip to China, as the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread, Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release to an expression and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his detention he was not able to meet his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July the European Parliament passed a decision where China was prompted to free his wife's arrest, Liu and his wife were promptly free from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomatic platinum of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as they were in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect to raise all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet all visits and receive them, which they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us-Ambassador Terry Branstad told that Americans have "him that he has the possibility for the treatment abroad, as far as it would help him in his satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for US Embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced that the message was informing the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities not only Liu, but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy in China drew a furious response from China to itself, with the exterior of the State Department that "no country has the right to participate in and irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protecting and freedom such as travel tips and access to medical care of its choice, which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkel and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to impose the Chinese government to impose Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, so that he could not enter into proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, the German government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported to Beijing's news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex by Liu could visit the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian ambassador John McCallum requested China to provide an appropriate medical care at providing a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to give himself up of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told him that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to meet Liu, with someone outside, including his attorneys, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada is calling for China to maintain its international human rights issues, including freedom of expression, to preserve the rights of this rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's State Department urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news of France information already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, there was no further information published whether France will eventually receive him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Russia in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release Liu and establish a major tolerance to those who want to use peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">In China, the Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progress Party called on China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in an explanation on 28 June at Liu's very worried and suggested that many have asked him to pray for Lius Wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that he took the initiatives that he took and for which he had been ripenalised to a harmonious, stable and wealthy China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moving and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Justice Minister, K. Shancourgam should be considered a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Polish Association of the State of New York, the Minister observed that many people criticise the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to turn" "" "the logic" "", "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, you can say that we don't have any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities, a must-hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons carried out by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared unintentional undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities which will permanently be led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the subject of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritative character will return to the present democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shancourgam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial coative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions asked him with non-answers of rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng invites Shancourgam to clear his opinion, since she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country but a city is, so what country is ours...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shancourgam would take the effort to clarify this point where he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing his comment on the blog, he comments concerning the critics that you should start to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that you can understand the context of the statements of Shancourgam better, according to that Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" as a country, "he stated why the elections in Singapore were so unimportant, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He performs Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore was no country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan illustrates his disappointment of Shancourgam, who is a leader of a growing generation that makes such polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which expected me - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shancourgam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even certain if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review covers the vulnerability of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shancourgam "committed a mistake" or was it a frivolous publisher?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of the City of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role inside the Governmental hospital, the statements made by Mr. Shancourgam are the importance of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a land or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In addition, the magazine Journey of a Decade applies to the event, Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have heard many of the people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defence of the land above all" etc., but that's not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices said before short, his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect at your habitation or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors about certain parts of the world, and a different facet shall be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, which lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question posed by me in Japan is: "are you an American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I am saying," "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and back in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation takes place the conversation, it is considered courteous to show interest in his conversational partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification then the standard answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inside of anger, if they are held for Americans, but me do not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians offer a Canadian banner good at their backpack, if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans are... yet.</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began travelling 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small chorus leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons at us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriage in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often. "</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered the tolerant country of ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like those types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing that would make me feel confused with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: as "nice" means to be said, basically, to be spying - like the benevolent, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has one's own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you go unnoticed in the background, distant from the things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a major stake in Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">Which accounts as "nice," maybe just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm hearted, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just 'nice'. our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodic Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop band has published a music video that the junta parody, which took power in 2014, and despite their promises to restore civilian government, the country continues to reigns.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what rules make his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the persistent military dominance of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video about the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days the video was uploaded to Facebook only 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month Charlie Chaplin-Video "has been blocked the dictator" in Thailand after a group of activists trained the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and playful introduction to Thai politics, especially as it acts with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these images of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand have been traced in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" refers to the draconical section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which is the commander-in-chief of the host's absolute decision on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program on the infamous program of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered by the Junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to repaid activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, which monitors online content and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy to have criminal prosecutions.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand puts a strict companion against "Lese Majest" (Majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the War Law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, even as people will be thrown into a black vans, before you bring them into an intersection bearing, another problem fall.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they are supposed to have caused "confusion" in society and to make internet users a long term penalties, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the song members of the band, who was imitated from "Die Tribute of Panem" was already used by coup leaders during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1811">These settlements are also known as the Catholic capitals in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people still lived here. today, there are only a few hundred people in these covites.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, approximately 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mama Africa" houses migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral pink Brillencer and gold-colored ear-rings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Braachula and grew up there. yet, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) become an destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with ground-grinding, crumble walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Frau Ramírez, people are coming into full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sitting outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay them, they massaged them with a balm that drew from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurstache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States, to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other directions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans speak already on WhatsApp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its companion managers, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker for building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answers. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells us that her guests are sending her often text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chicken to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez may be very well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">In the other end of the city, a cul-gasse road leads to Jesús Valenela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family are included in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants can be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started trying to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and cooking outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenciela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was moved out of the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapia comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an alluating, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the home of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, travellers consult their telephones quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother she blames her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair-spots that you have made a demonstration, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she introduces them briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, marching and marching.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cell phone users received a mobile phone message in the Tianshan district of Urumqi a cell phone, where they address the District government, to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "to hinder access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities trusted the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app before they had replaced the app with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes by the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "" "" activities and "" "" harmful information "" "" including videos, images, books and documents. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanders website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users attentive to them how much time they spend online, and to remote control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used naturally in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers are able to manipulate or steal home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, forced ethnic minority interests such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme interest and monitoring measures, as well as routinemized Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media-based media outlet" Images from Mainland China "" "" ("" "" Eastern Europe "" ""), published by local news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police officers had indiscriminated the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the monitoring app. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the app will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use equipment which are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the surveillance technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back to Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from Mainland China" "" "(" "" "Eastern Europe" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and therefore get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones are integrated into Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city-party council which minimize illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, agencies, and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions from Cybersecurity Office to follow their computers and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a U.S. human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a decree establishing all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media-memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy this action. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible clubs, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2007">During the third night the things had calmed down, after the power supply was stopped in the neighbourhood.</seg>

<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them changed while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my feeling in my body - and my voice, why I heard it to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noticed the cooling, and found no favour at all, why he was next to a electrically charged staff.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My seminaked body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to put my sleep again; let's say that it was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours forgetting, that came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the dawn fills the space ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I reply with the voice of an exhaustive youth: "my Lord, my father must make himself terrifying."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk away, you'll be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always released.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photograph was taken by aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he smiles at his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">However, on what you can rely on, a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine-stained lips can be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house that belonged to them since 1967; the year where Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist, the conservative majority recieved and their old-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapesmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Refugee. all these issues can not only be found in its home town of Amman, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria through to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can join the people who have suffered the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it, he appealed against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian Refugee in the second generation - so he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine so far.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," Hdaib stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man, while he poured into two cups in water. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senumerable boy has little to do with a protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the cups of a warm coffee and the shame of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free sky, especially if one accuses a view into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, one avoids basic things to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not to land.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has canceled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Act - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed Sinno, which contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tabby.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokeswoman for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been "just" because of the sexual orientation of the Sangman.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which inquery the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian nation as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to deploy "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply being silly rhetoric, but actually a clearly evident-crystallized reality reflected in Jordan, which appears clear in Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib made traditional Sexually-ternormen to marry his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have voorhelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a evidenounced wife whose arms and legs are stretched to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trusted.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'honorary de' has risen in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch: according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Citizen reached its peak in 2016; however, it has still been added that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women, victims, attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law prohibiting a law from the year 1954, women who are exposed to danger of domestic violence, "and for their release is often a lonely bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, not to be afraid of themes in his country long as taboos.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, is being aware that he is his music, which is full of explicit attack on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was told of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still strong in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanic online program Roya, to note later that his comments were torn from context, twisted and had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"at Youtube, it was uploaded without a cuts, but it was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib pays open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance about homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do this not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they expressed themselves on comments in social media critically crucial to the problems, associated with the deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs is said that only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent link and take it. Jordan has now revered for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees itself Hdaib - consists of slow, need and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreamt such as millions of other Arabs also, from a Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is supported by music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, scattering unitions, and artificial way.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time is, Hdaib will continue to continue and also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the drums, and dancing over more than one thousand years have come across and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two buggy eyes are straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2158">However, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival has the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way in the summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom were external appearance and body care so important as in this story, because they are helping to keep away the Peruvian youth from crime, and promote a legitimate profession like the hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug dealers are all daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hair styles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), and Neymar (Brazil) has led to provide more normalities in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these elaborate hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, even an annual event inspired, the competition of hairstyle "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts to show each other, to show who can see the exact Looks out of them, as you can see in the following video (see additional videos on current competitor) on the public Facebook profile (Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against barber tools and place them instead of bad advice on hairdresser's clothing that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year early in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the" "" "Liebesmessages" "" "guerrillas" "", "which publishes the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it a lot more important, people that feel extinct, affection to common?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question came to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young-Youth Foundation by the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) who encouraged young people to write guerrillas.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before columnist, however, there is a long way until you can talk about an effective reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillatroopers, who lived for many years in illegal camps, have been subjected to military rhetoric, and around the clock carried their weapons in themselves, now they have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In turn, the Colombian society, in turn, struggled to life in constant fear and in some cases deepened hatred against guerilla fighters, must now record them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnist had to close together and would help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages on former guerrilla fighting to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrillas who should then be handed to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureates that took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he will continue to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent promise.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, now find their place in society and establish itself a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a joint history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i have never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogoti traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC on how they had done earlier in order to counter the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters of substituting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings to go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed the letters to the letter, a former fighter was led by the guerrilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed a MGL pomegranate, a lethal weapon in the thorn-Sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I asked him, "Hello, what are they doing?" he said, "I reply to a letter that somebody has written."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "then suddenly tears of tears have walked on my cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him, and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something from life as war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine. "I never thought that someone would forgive myself for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Till now, I have only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some leaders of the FARC arrived in a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced how to develop social injustice on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country more righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never had seen hearing before and had no electoral law, and to recognise that people who were often seen as a monster, and hated even only people with beautiful feelings that were surrounded by their life's circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianern was made aware that after the disarmament of peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise to weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Now we use the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">This is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our Word, make our contribution, and offer sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. to those who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a Damocleset on the right of LGBTQ-community, is not only created over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual wife from Grozny, who shared some of her experience with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines in several months ago, after reports were published, which were printed, torture and killing of queens in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who took suspicious queens and raised them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt her childhood since her childhood, that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they grow up, it became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so that she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Tschetschens had experienced by gender equality, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life she moved over to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who put in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone, of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round about WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a defect: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you still escape the family, you smuck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two key abated in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances you were laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor stood up and laid me in the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful for him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, they wrote - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They found absurd receivables: some said to me, I have to prove that I was upset up without the streets; others want I had not changed in the official television in Grozny, and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only evil, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what should I say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once to my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the entire Republic humiliated." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a froous woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window was a car with darkened windshield and a plate plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it was the third time it was clear to me that something lazy was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the number of license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to pay their names, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother, as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without record, without ID, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe, you are in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you stole. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, however, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements have I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish it too, this seelian barrier cannot be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I will actually give myself effort to look as the person remembers them from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I was talking to someone who gave a one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that while Ramadan was not arrested and tortured during the Ramadan, but also that all of the Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, my opinion, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still in this secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there would be no many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to settle Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are arrested there, so that you can present them as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, it seemed to be used specifically to radialize himself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a delay or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And the so-called Lord, that person was even when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not presented as a bandits, so far there were no reports. we suggest that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known around Grozny when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to lead us to the "Civization," but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were slipped; I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never changed a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people came there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an affection: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "carrot isn't about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it often to children, if that are fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just kept their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never chased, and never smitten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadensage stay?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality on morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us, but rather on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who have landed and laughed before, looked at yourself with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity now you go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I agree with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, mergers, I meditate them to hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't get a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself, when I abdicated concessions.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's aligning.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to know you with foam in front of your mouth, that there is no momentary among them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have who, the Cabardine have the ones, the Russians also have they; on the whole planet it does exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicable Muslims who walk to the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about transitions of men who love men, and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a deception.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be precise, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups campaigned to an increase of self-moral within the poor Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong increase of self-mordes since the last months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, came the desperate situation of the Arabian Ahwazi community in Iran that is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to come up for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to remain in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video played on YouTube, where he had lit the moments, after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the valley's suburban hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the doctors were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabian Ahwazi minority, and activists warned that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all the family fathers that were helpless and incapable of getting their families to feed their families and pursue a secure work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of the Arab Ahwazi community is located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power, and 1925 great efforts made it to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the richest and valuable materials for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy still develops slowly, and the native population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">She is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to systematically migrate workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has built a number of tribes, the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to manage the devastation of the region in the region, and to destroy local agriculture and palms and palms-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Avozi-youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," a "high rise" of self-moral killers among young Ahwazi's men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse, the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ahwaz, ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab Discrimination in the integration process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions do not prefers Arabic labour force, the local Arabian Ahwazi will have access to working opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her living conditions outside your homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their affiliation to the ancestor so that even Arab names will not be tolerated in the workplace, because speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, beat human rights activists before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world wakes up and knowledge of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustrations.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought good scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist, and why we generally, all feminists should be within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various sectors of life have stumbled upon a glass blanket, and that discrimination based on gender are still crosswise through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer double and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to skin color, on racism, on black sorrel women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTI community, or on black women in the LGBT community; if I mention, on which way we have been physically, seelically and verbally abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists did not decide to mention many white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet, however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to emptied their voices, and to sing 'Kumbaya, to sing my lord' to obtain equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, a institutional form of racist motivated violence, which we have been suspended black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin are less of earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are more often referred to the school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want to have all men, all males and all human beings, either skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can take myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman likes to consider unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which relate to gender as well as on the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I'm not going to fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Soil lamented in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a deserted and marginalised nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I'm refusing to join me groupings, which also absorb the customs of customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to finalize the importance of skin color and sex. because some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revert them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women more different gences and spread themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself full and entirely of feminism and called me of the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women on our own shows and give us in the spheres that are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book africa womanism: how we can defend ourselves, we can define ourselves on our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately invoke separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman recognized as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life neither passed, nor ignored, is still rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Over the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or canoe - with a special concerns through the Kurdistan Regional Region. its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa that explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river, which we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is involved in protecting and supporting the rivers, streams and water paths in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources.

<seg id="2474">At the end of the video Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we don't have any water, how would we survive?"</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weireinefoot) who is reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex partner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship had been some time, and the police said, their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further woman Balbuena was given because of failure, the Ada Báez did not use nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women should see at all, in general, they do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Intuition and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system which does not substrate 3-of-the laws: good approach, deficient realization and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even prove the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, these figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, for domestic violence, the Office Attorney of 9600 admits to domestic violence. at 70% of them it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads of domestic violence because of domestic violence. 86% of ads came from women here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women said they were physically abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, this statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women of female Ana Baiardi there are only few of these crimes actually displayed. "on each woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women will not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "in any woman who imburse because of physical abuse, two women, who do not do this," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is no separate offense, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented, as many women will be murdered each year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay was documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to its estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent actions by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and an legal system that doesn't undertake anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want it, but then, after that, it was supposed to be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she endured the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier this, I always thought that this only happens to be submissive, because they deceive of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuses by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without names, she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana that they had fallen the so long of Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuses at least have a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner harassed them abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO ("I believe you,") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without any outcome and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partner who developed into an inconsistent legal battle between Paraguay and their home country, in which it went mainly to money, power, and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Shays laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very well, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The admissions of abuses is a way full of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems with the use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nonone Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law sees to explain the feminid to an independent crime-continuance and punish harder as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislature was changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that they were afraid that the way for the decriminalization of abortions may be banned, which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The initial bill was planned, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, which have to carry the victims of violence themselves, if they simply want to receive only ad and receive a safe accommodation to expose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse are seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, so violence should not be regarded as a little later.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in view of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to that the perpetrators are gone out.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must restore so long, until misuse is no longer valid.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified, however, among other things, a passage that was called for partners in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The submission of the words "gender", "political force" and "sexual harassment" of parts of the law, however, is regarded as a large blow.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weireinefoot) who is reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2545">In Oman, independent media in Oman exposed to ban on a paper attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Secretary" on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Peruvian authorities closed an independent Arab-language daily Azamn because of its reporting on corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues in prison where he served a year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and taken before the Court, however, was later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Saïd who came to power after he had set his father, Said ibn Taimur, who had revolted with a coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Chief of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>

<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closing and detention three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 over corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misconceptions</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is done with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most critical needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need to be conducted on site medical research. there are two reasons for a lack in the offer of global health and vaccines that cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, is helping to establish its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he inquired about HIV-virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on misconceptions of media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just stared a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research. we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver, instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult, to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or move here, as financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous power supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion for the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of the world, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the lack access to scientific expertise that can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This entry of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solutions to environmental issues worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding the salad since the 1980 "s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA-astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was set only by its own accruby and the question as many salts of salts can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he realized that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ripped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been applied for ever more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trends, plant-breeders, environmental protectors and experts ensure food safety will ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton is still looking for a salad, but he still needs longer since its work continues to continue with more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a rock broocks in a river, to whom I have to paddling." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must do this now, but it's a breach with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents have to go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, nobody can breed a new sage variety because all the characteristics are already patented. so he's doing so well as possible and tries to extract those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavoured to use a material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he also joined a movement that is increasingly bigger in the United States and throughout the world. open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeder)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten red Römersalat's variety of diving in the "glasshouse" of the station and it is being tested there if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and did not be protected as intellectual property and are usable for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to use that others can freely use of them farmed seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to buy businesses and sell it. "open source, breeder only allow others to breed their seed, to breed as their own varieties, and it will not immediately trigger two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many herbal patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seeds have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds is according to him a role in larger clamity such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter not or only little to breed seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement did not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, the most recent examples have to buy locally sourced vegetables, such as for example in peasant markets, should also know that the way is farmed as this vegetable is being bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereign without seed supremacy is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to ensure other their seed remains free to provide. thus, in contrast, these are to be patented, seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available genpool is due to the increasingly abundant spiritual property rights in plant material, which is thus always restricted, unceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the director of Ossi, employed in her PhD work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all backotings are protected as intellectual property, making it either useless for plant-breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not yet some estimates, but experts like Luby suggests that mass-based plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question Of The Visials</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - of such, by which their taste or their color improves up to such, because they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patches on plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for breeders are declining by more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions are much worse than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company established themselves for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property purchases other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varied innovations." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection doesn't prevent innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton is looking for a different way to wait for another 20 years until a patent inflict, and certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long for plants to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, we would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have been a generalized well, and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers' work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">A total of Morton interferes in the concept to patented plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of breeding breeding: "he who chases a variety, also breed its own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, are needed, are breeding into his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very gentry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are) patents, it can survive the most smaller seed companies, either refuse to survive the patented or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be ultra-innovative: "it looks as if I do with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ourselves, "he says." with a patent you can be protected for 20 years before competition, with which it simply makes it easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a "open source" seed sector. the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come on "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organisation Agrecol works on an "open source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for the breaches differ from country to country, absent because the Ossi obligation is not simply being taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventional farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is necessary to implement the Member States, the Patent Office to implement these new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, in the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies across East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards patching seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for the" Open Source "" "" seed Systems "" "" program for Open Source "" "" seed Systems "" "," is currently building a worldwide alliance for "" "" Open Source "" "" for seed systems that will fall for the scheduled start next year. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - represents the view that farmers have to come to seed, to exchange and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a variety of food supplies with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a link by the Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will see him soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been considered, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role" "", "so Luby." "" "we are now trying to discover people that are more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August the Egyptian government shut down the website of the Arabic network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported on this.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities were sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for Human Rights Information lead - despite this attack and the remocking of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend their goal, so it was never so difficult as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not to admit our task. we hope to keep our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera for "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web page bulations for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides the HRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnist and Human Rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he writes in Egypt not available websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog was established to circumvent the apparatus of the Egyptian government, the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider that is also home to Ziadas blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and took a video as the police raged physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights conditions in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada remarks on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to unlock is very old, however, in the era of deldelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, preload of the national Security Council, the lock blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an impact if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) open Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06. August 133 pages. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, AFTE also documented the locking of providers to be possible through internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we saw how to offer blocking of websites, VPNs, we began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content, and filtering the content that they might have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is concealed in addition, that the cargo decisions are taken behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using them in front of the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government to go with censorship and whom will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day report newspapers in Brazil, with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered," "" "thieves the pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">Violence in the middle of the crisis in the middle of the economic crisis and in a divided financial situation reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday, and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "thus the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio known newspaper" "" "Extra" on August 16 the Editorial "" "" This is not normal, "" "" in which she announced, a new section called "" "" War in Rio "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexual break, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we did not close our eyes in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor, announced that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't know war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper declared that there are 843 countries following the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro in 843 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, even though it can be used, grasp the police, which first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the designation "War" more than it benefit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues that the journalist Cecília Oliveira asserts the violence as the "war." this is their opinion on a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to take account by the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as in the analysis of the military approaches in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and an historical and self-counterfeit investment of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, is false: "22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeastern part of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>

<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, belonged to a police unit whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police station and a unit permanently stationed there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of nonviolent death. for several years, the UPP, however, according to several reports about the poor congregations and repression of the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his article published in 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio not comply with the criteria for the name "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws a serious consequences for the people after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Because this requires the state to use funds and ways that are typical for a war. this is the penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and an object for "collateralharm" and "distorted spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, is the fact that the inhabitants of Favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, it is now that the police extinguish the mountain with the Favela Jacksonzinho, in order to assassinate the death of a police officer.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, those of rebels have been controlled areas outside Damascus under siege, what led to that inhabitants have been relied on locally or through tunnel and control points.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The head of the project, Nabil, said to the French News Agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protested on 21 October in many neighbourhoods in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramped in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died, and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande was a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, in Portugal alone, around 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke off between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban continued for their hatred for the Hazara famous Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself back in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohaul. the work was heavy and made it ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself, in order to make himself his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we put nylon in front of the open windows, so that we don't freeze it at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made themselves ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran solely through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day of food in needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness quotas is a sort of second chance for asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers are catastrophic in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special receptive centres" "". "this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre, if they officially put an application for asylum - which can go after the registration of asylum seekers for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for a vacation rental, have either relied on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it was Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unmissable life of life helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf had its entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good, that he opened a second hostel after a while, and a whisperlover was opened.</seg>
