That's James Risen.
They may know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA lost illegally by Americans.
But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service operation where the CIA had literally sorely on Iran for a nuclear bomb.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know whom the chapter did not feel at all?
The US government.
For almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.
In this train, he became the symbol of the government's pattern to condemn Whistleblower and repelling journalists.
According to First Constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the sample they provide.
So when the government knocked out in Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison.
So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.
But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, though they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped.
The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.
Instead of failure and railways to get statements, we could also do his digital footprints for him.
And thus, investigators, without his consent, is worried about his phone conversation,
Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.
In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crawling source.
Unfortunately, it is only one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower at his instigate, but instead, justice has condemned to more than all U.S. governments.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government constituted too much of their work as secret.
Since September 11, almost every article about national security provided that a whistleblowers had to be a journalist.
Thus, we put the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional proposition, because the government has more possibilities to pionage all.
But just like technology of the government admitted to circumvent reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources.
And even though they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact, instead of entering, in the witness.
Today there are communication software that had not been written as Risen had written a book, and it is considerably safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source release system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the author of the author, which was developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news web site, such as the Washington Post here.
You can upload documents, or send documents, just like any ordinary contact form.
These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the corresponding news agency has access.
So the government cannot create more information in secret, and many of the information they would like, would not be available from the outset.
SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments will always develop new spy technologies all over the world.
It is in us to ensure that not only technology data like Edward Snowden have a possibility of misuse iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,
The lack of disputes in the supply of soldiers is modest and overcrowded in the hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the Alarm proposes to contaminate the water of Flint. or an Wallst-Insider, that warn us from the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.
Thanks.
[on April 3, 2016 the largest data leck of history has been revealed.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that Reiche and Mighty] [enormous money] have been hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to a statement.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's based law firm Mosseca
The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.
We receive an impression of how customers, banks and attorneys are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"
We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works as it works.
This has already led to the first very direct consequences.
Islands Prime Minister is resigned.
There are also reports that a ally owned by the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad wrote trailers in tax havens.
It claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend from kindergages, a famous Cellists.
Now there will be a lot of richer people and others to wait for the next release, and to the next revealed documents.
Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.
It seems cry out of you, me, ordinary people.
Why should we do that?
But the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.
And this concerns us all.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
In the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and contribute to their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal more than ten years.
I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always put it like a sailor.
So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.
It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.
I think it's interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.
Probably because there were no prominent Americans so far, which came in these revelations, scandal.
Well, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.
However, by the principle, after which these tax havases work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.
If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.
In fact, it is so that you need fewer information in some US states to order less information to start a company as to get a library fee.
This kind of intransparency in the United States has admitted to school children, school children.
It has allowed cheers to pick up, especially vulnerable investors.
It is this type of behavior that affects us all.
Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.
How does that work?
So we sent a secret investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.
Our investigator gave himself as African ministers to bring suspicious money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer from our investigator might make suggestions for transferring his money.
These were all premonitions. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course there was no harm of this system. however, it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important to consider this as a single case.
It is not about a single lawyer, who underlined his secret investigator suggestions.
It is not about a single top-leading politicians, involved in a scandal.
It is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
And to cope with this, we need to change the rules.
We need to change rules to make this type of behaviour difficult.
This may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything against it, as if anything is ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.
But as a borrowed optimist I see that a lot has begun to change.
Over the past few years, we have seen priority to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.
The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.
Since then, the EU has entered at national registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.
One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind here.
Representatives of both parties have entered into two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as means used to ensure in the US and global for more transparency.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.
We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headships.
"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""
We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this to end this kind of intransparency.
Together, we can finally end the intransparency, which has now made this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.
This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Macedonian.
A day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my gear.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in town and made straight road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.
I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.
It was late. I got tired.
While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"
"" "he made the whole thing even worse," "" "I don't know." "" "" ""
And I thought: "Oh, man!
What do I do now? "
Who doesn't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?
But I just met him! he says he would go to the corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land the trunk for a Mazdas.
This is a small trunk!
Then I heard myself: "I have a air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room."
"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""
At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I spelt down?
A wild sleep in my living room.
What if he's crazy? "
I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, on Zehentips to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.
But he wasn't crazy.
We are still in contact.
The artwork, which he had bought from me, is now on his classroom. he is now a teacher.
This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.
Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered?
People on my air mattresses has been normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.
Let us make a time jump, two years later...
I'm unemployed, almost pleite, to attract my roommates and the rent is increased.
I heard that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.
I think creativity can create it, fear into fun.
I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Bed-Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.
Ha! "
We created a website and established so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor at 20 dollars on the air floor.
They found it super, and we too.
I'm sure our cheese ham and omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and shut the door into the castle, Brian and I arrived.
Did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?
Things came into the rolls.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.
So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website, on which people share publicly images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closed when visiting.
On the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.
"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""
We waited, that the rocket would ignite.
But they do not.
Nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people.
Why?
Because we all learnt to children that foreigners are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you know about things that can be good. we were designed to layout.
At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.
We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence, between people who had never met before.
Can design be done so?
Is it possible to create with design confidence?
I want to give you a cost sample, which degree can we penetrate.
It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up, if you are ready.
Take your mobile phone into your hand.
Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.
Type your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.
This softly flight of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.
Because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your SMS, you'll see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?
Most of the people feel responsibility.
So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.
Only for this reason our company can exist.
So who's actually Al Gores handy?
Could you tell us on Twitter that he is decomposed for the office of the president?
You can now return the cell phones now.
They have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor would have imagined with his name, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?
Imagine, you would have 150 evaluations, which all say: "he can really hold off very well-locked mobile phones!"
How would you feel if you have to deliver your mobile phone?
Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust.
At the beginning we did some things wrong.
It was difficult for people to pick negative evidence.
In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their pasties before we presented them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are at age and residence.
Not surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.
This is a natural social pressures.
It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.
If one has less than three convictions, nothing changes.
But one has more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation is composed of similarities.
So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.
Moreover, we discovered that trust depend on how much you get from rate.
Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.
If you tell too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.
Tell too much, as for example, "I have problems with my mother. -- -- the request is not accepted.
So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great masterpieces in your apartment! I'll do with my family holiday."
How can I create it with design, creating these degrees in openness?
We use the size of text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write something.
Our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices opposite strangers.
With which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to cover these prejudices.
Here you see how many people take our offer.
One can recognize three things.
First: unbelievably good luck.
Second: the tireless work of our team.
Third: a need, which had previously been met before.
Business is just very good for us.
Of course there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.
There were guests who have been allowed to have partying parties, or have ravaged apartments.
Guests have let guests stand in the rain.
At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.
There is nothing worse than these calls. it is hurt when I just think.
The disappointment, which you hear in the voice of caller, was and will always be our motivation to improve ourselves.
Fortunately, only a fraction had a problem of 123 million in the 123-million overnight stays.
For people confided right to each other.
When trust works, the wonder can arise.
One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.
His host drove him to hospital.
He even spends blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his assessment:
"perfect house for travellers, who are inclined to heart attacks due to sitting activities.
The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who can save life even though they don't know quite correctly.
They drive one in their own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.
You can even stay longer without charge extra nights.
I can only recommend it! "
So, of course, not every stay starts.
But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.
When I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:
How does the idea of part with money transactions work together?
It is here about an economical trading.
But now just call "rental industry" will not be fair.
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People have a part of itself open, and that changes everything.
When you travel today, it is easy to compare to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically.
What would, however, if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?
What if at any place that one would have visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a lot in a pub pentour neighborhood, of which one has never heard;
Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we would create apartments of reason for sharing?
How would that look like?
What if cities would accept the idea of a shared share?
I imagine cities, which enable us to society and relations, instead of loneliness and destruction.
In South Korea's capital, Seoul has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,
Have now been offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,
Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started.
To finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, over our platform, night 785 000 people will be resident in 191 countries with a stranger or even hosting.
The idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught.
We haven't invented the wheel.
Hospitality also existed before.
There were similar websites in front of us.
So why did our work?
Apart from Happiness and Timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence.
Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.
I think it's amazing,
Almost overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes over to me.
We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.
But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.
Thanks.
What do you think, if you watch me?
A believer? a expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or suppressed, subjected to a brain wear, a terrorist act?
Or just a delay at the airport's security check at the airport.
This is actually true.
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.
Thus, the media represent people that look like me.
A study showed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.
Studies show: Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.
Probably people don't speak with their uber-drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to meet you.
I tell you who I am.
I am a mother, a coffee maker - double espresso, with cream extra.
I am introverted,
A seegrowing fitness fanatics,
And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.
I decided to do this.
When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.
No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.
My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"
The funny thing: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.
I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.
I have delays with the Koran.
I read it, thought in question, doubted and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
She was trust and slow devotion, deepened at each of the Korans.
The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes for weeping.
I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Had you ever feel that someone receives you, you fully understand, and somehow loves you?
It feels like that.
Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptian, my career as an engineer.
I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the "Egyptian-American Dream."
Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember where they were there.
I sat in my kitchen, had dinner at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Express announcement."
There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people spout from buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical disorder?
My shock turned itself quickly in indignation.
Why should we do something?
I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"...,... "... in the name of Islam..."... "Eastern descent..."... "...
Oh, my God.
"" "" "" "it was not only my country attacked, but in the Nu transformed me the acts of others by one citizen in a suspects." ""
On the same day we had to drive through the U.S. west of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.
I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deeply it went in my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as the Muslim.
We moved into our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.
And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be alert," "be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "rebuke you not."
I stayed the whole week inside.
Then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather to prayer.
And again the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."
I saw the extensive coverage.
The feelings were understandably ridiculed, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims to become free.
There were really fire on mosques.
I thought: we should stay at home.
But something did not feel right.
Because people who attacked this country, attacked our country.
"" "" "" "I have picked the rage of the people on the terrorists." ""
Imagine! I was also angry.
It is not easy to explain permanently.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
These are the accusations that are hard.
Today we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.
When will we go? "
Some people want to ban Muslims and join mosques.
They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.
The question is: are we malignant or benign?
They know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.
The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.
Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but an important organ.
Thanks!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, arousal and Olympionic risks.
Will the closure of mosques of America be safer?
There will perhaps be some parking freihon, but not stop the terror.
The regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people other faith tolerant, and show greater participation.
And as a director of the police in the Washington D.C. area recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.
They are radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.
At the radicalization process, it has found that it begins online. as a result, the person can make a brain laundering, even from their family, so that the person thinks that the terrorists are abhor the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or of faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group is justified with the Koran as the IS.
As Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.
But we would like to add us into their precursor, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thanks!
The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.
Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "Holy Book."
But when you cast a look at her, she does not drive what they are in their "Holy Scripture."
It is their brutality that they can read these things in the Scriptures.
A remarkable imam told me a amazing history:
A girl came to him, because they are bright, to join the IS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, their sense for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.
Nothing inspires and something that had been given to their anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.
This Imam turned the connection to God and their church.
Rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real shift in the world.
What she learned in the mosque, she kept back to join the IS.
This was an insight, like the Islamophobia and my family concerned.
But how does it affect normal Americans?
How does it affect anyone else?
How does the 24 hour consumption of fear of fear of our democracy affect our freedom of freedom?
A study -- actually several neuroscientists studies -- show: when we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.
We rather accept a authoritarian governance system, conformity and prejudices.
A study shows that if you report test subjects news in which negative more than Muslims were reported, they voted more than military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look when the mood against Muslims pushed forward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the apron of Iraq and during two election periods.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror, as I expected it.
It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to elevate the foundation of a free society, rational and well informed citizens.
The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.
We feel it perhaps the first but the toxic air of fear vanes us all.
In the signing of collective innocence it is not just about to explain itself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was very promising at the dental faculty, talented, promising...
His sister would say that he was the sweetest, the most generous person she knew.
She visited him there, and showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:
"" "" "" "when is such a wasted young man from my breasts?" "" "" ""
Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon, as with an execution after he posted utterances against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot eight times on Deah.
Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after the 9 / 11?
Have we gone to the mosque or stayed at home safely?
We felt it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was about to let America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely choose our religion.
We decided to choose the mosque.
We set up with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure on the mosque.
I took him out, my shoes went out, and went into the building hall, and what I saw was stopped.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made a announcement, he thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came to attack us, but to help us.
In this moment, I am collapsed.
These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices.
What will you choose?
What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatismus?
Will you go safe at number?
Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you beautiful!
Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.
But I ask myself, what do you say that you think that you are holding a TEDTalk, a memorandum with depth, in a nostalgic thought factory, an exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogadied: I would say you don't fool. I am completely normal.
I am no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am so usually how it is allowed.
When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever-headed study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.
So I'm in any way an exception.
If humans appear as a rule, the rule is often broken, and they are not the exception to rule.
HW: thank you. Dalia Mogadied.
What started as a hobby for Bastler, stands shortly before, to become a billionaire business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drinkers. possible, it is possible in research institutions around the world.
Before air pact enters our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a couple of years ago, they began to fly with ropes.
By connecting boxes, air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in narrowest space.
You can also build self-tensioned structures.
They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and react in general to natural laws.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our aim is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.
In order to have an autonomous system, it must know collectively know where the mobile objects are located.
In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic new tasks.
For the demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offspin of our laboratories.
There are no external cameras.
Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, computting calculations on what the machine should do.
"" "external commands are at the highest ebe. g." "" "and" "" "landing" "". "" ""
This is a so-called stern starter,
A flying unit tries to beat two flies with a flap.
Like other starting flights it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
Unlike most starters, it can float, and thus has great benefits for starting and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
A limitation of hedgevity is that they react sensitively to turbulence as wind turbines.
We develop new control and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered, and the performance can be improved by practicing.
Okay.
During our research, we often ask the basic abstract issues related to the core of the matter.
One such question would be: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts, which accumulate in order to violate you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern ruder.
Unlong we discovered that flying with just one works.
This is the monospinner, the mechanical simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.
It has only a movable part, a propeller,
No valves, hinges and querruders, no further actuators or controllers, only one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, the indoor life happens very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space.
Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-rigid. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.
The likelihood of throwing it exactly if all of you look on is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.
When the Monbugger is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this overflow?
They see that he is just symmetrical.
Therefore, it is more ambivalent in its alignment.
Thereby he gets the greatest ability to receive,
Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even as it rotates.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.
Some things happen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.
Let's see that.
When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.
This machine consists of two separate two-propellers-propellers.
This revolves in clockwise
And the other against the clockwise.
When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.
If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly if limited.
We will now demonstrate that, making a half of airworthy.
The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of esthetic expression.
We took retail micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with local technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.
Hopefully, you motivate this demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly secure machine there would like to grow on the Broadway a flying lampshade.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.
For types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.
It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart sips to form them in a spectacular way.
The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential, the dot is on the i.
Thank you very much.
Over a 3 billion years ago in a very far distant Galaxy, two black holes are getting faster and they turned the mass three things in one tenths of pure energy.
This short moment they lit up brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe.
It was a very big bang.
Their energy they were not set free in the form of light --
We finally speak of black holes.
The entire energy was given into space-time-weight itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Arrange the events at first time.
Over 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on earth.
Since then, Earth has brought a lot more: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God arise - even the internet.
Some 25 years ago, a group especially muted -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector, to look for gravitational waves, which arise through collidizing black holes.
Most of them held them crazy.
But enough people recognized it as a mad genies that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.
After decades of development, design, design and extremely much hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer, gravity Observatory.
During the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was greatly increased, which improved the detection performance enormously.
Therefore we called it Advanced Ligo.
At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.
On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start of the detectors, the gravitation waves of the two collidizing black holes passed through the earth.
They went through you and me
And through the detector.
Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
The birth of my daughter
And the farewell from my death.
In essence, it was the fruits of my life.
All that I had worked for is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied Gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories such as Ligo measurable signals. what are Gravitational waves?
A gravitation wave is a crap in the weight of space and time.
When moving the shaft, space and whole content are stretched to one direction and perched into the other.
To illustrate them, lecturers lead to the relativity-theory often a real albery dance.
"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."
The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
On the 14th of September, for example, each of us stretched the waves and gestures. the elongation of an average human average was 10 high -21.
The name of 20 zeros after Komma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.
With a five kilometers long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length must be measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear point. that is grotesk.
At the end of his classic text about gravity
Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are massive.
But physicist are finderisch and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "
Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo be more than an eye than an eye.
I want to explain what this means.
Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.
This is quite practical. because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking out of several points next light around you.
In the case that's different.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that means particularly much:
To the face of your child.
Instead, we listen to specific properties like sound position and pitch, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind.
"now just talk Alice."
"and Bob interrupts them."
"number Bob."
The same applies to gravitational waves.
We can't make any simple pictures of objects in all.
But by taking changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least, for Ligo the measured frequency is in the audible area.
So, if we convert the pattern to sound pattern, we can hear all literally.
The gravity of the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott are already busy.
SH: two black, no rotating holes, circular: wupp!
Turning the two body very quickly, you can hear the same cirpen with an additional sound change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.
It is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform.
AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - Ligo said the following: [Surrender the noise] that he knows what he must hear, this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as quickly as the rod of your shaker.
AA: let's consider ourselves what this means.
Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 probes, orbit a hundred times per second before they collide.
Imagine the forces.
Fantastic.
And we know, because we have heard it.
Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.
Ligo ebnet a whole new way to explore the Alls, as it was never possible before.
On this way, we can listen to the space and the invisible.
Much in all we can -- practically or in principle -- do not see.
A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mass-birds explode in Supernovae.
They are very useful. we learned a lot about that.
The thrilling physical processes happen, however, in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon.
We will never see, since these opak are.
Gravitation waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is hidden by its own neighbor.
Using gravitation waves, it should be possible to back up until the beginning.
And most importantly, I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.
In fact, Ligo found just like the first run of things we had not expected.
My colleague, MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes emerged as Ligo is observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour cherries for our archaeological work.
Ligo makes us a completely different view of the events in all, towards the emergence of the stars, and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.
AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.
Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the space and circling the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on earth and all.
For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?
Now the time is great dreams.
Do you dream with us.
Thanks.
Some time ago I tried a experiment.
"" "for one year, I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "in front of whom I was afraid." ""
No matter if it made me nervous, in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.
Did I want to speak to the public?
No, but yes!
Would I be live on television?
No, but yes!
I wanted to start playing with the show?
No, no, no, but yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, when I was afraid, did my fear.
My fears, to keep speaking, my social fear -- puff, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""
"yes" changed me.
But there was a certain Yes that changed my life on an unexpected species. it started with a question of my little ones.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all unexplainable reasons all "kittens."
As if she would be a waitress from the south.
"" "" "" "cookies, I need milk for my grab." "" "" ""
She once asked me if I could play with her, when I was just on the leap. and I said, "Yes."
This is the beginning
A new life setting in my family. from there I fainted to play with them as soon as you do. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired.
It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.
But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently, I understood that the "Yes" Sagen to play my career with my children.
I have a real dream job.
I am an author. I think things out, consider your life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I create television. I produce TV.
I do television, in large style.
In this TV season, I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program to the world.
Four TV programs, 70-hour television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.
Every show gives hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.
Let us say five.
A new episode every nine days to four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV channels, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, time four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,
350 million dollars for a season.
In America my TV series run on Thursday night.
All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hours are programmes that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories.
Four TV series, 70-hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, burning around the world.
Do you know who still does it?
No one, therefore I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I want to impress you with that.
I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.
I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you're using a company, a country or a classroom, allow me to take a business or a classroom, so that I am not just about the computer, and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that at a dream job do not dream of dreams.
It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work much, hard and I love it.
When I'm in my work, there is no other feeling.
My work creates a country out of nothing.
"" "" "" "it is, when I set up troops, I painted on a screen." ""
As a result, there's a high tone, delivered a marathon.
You feel like Beyoncé.
And all that at the same time.
I love to work.
It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and steadorable, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, and the best thing is the sums.
There's such a change in me if the job works well.
A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could go to her forever.
Many people assume that when I tell them the sums that I speak about writing that writing to me is joy.
Don't understand me wrong, that does it.
But the sums -- when I began to work and work in television as I began to work and work, build up, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.
The sums is more than writing.
The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.
The sums is music. the sums is light and air.
The sums is God's voice in my ear.
And if you have a sum, then you can not strive to strive to size.
The feeling that can not be different to strive for size, no matter what price.
This is called the sums.
Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.
Perhaps it's called genius.
Maybe it means ego.
Perhaps it is the fear of failure.
I don't know.
I only know that I am not made for the failure, and I just know that I love the sum.
I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it.
To make a clear question: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more excessive limits, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more things I write story, the more expectations exist.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love working, isn't it?
The country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.
I like this sums. I love the sums.
I need the sums. I am the sums.
Am I only this sums?
And then the sums stopped.
Revised, overloaded, overdone, burned, burned.
The sums stopped.
Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mommy is a single working law.
"" "Harper told people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""
And Emerson says: "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."
It is the children of a Titans.
You are baby-Titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.
The sums of the engine stopped.
I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.
The sums came not back.
My sums was broken.
I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no sums.
In me was silence.
Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a show Titan,
Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the sums and the sums was me.
So what to do if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?
I know, some might think: "crite you, stemmed the author Titan."
But you know, you do, you do, you are working to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives a sum when you know the sums when the sums stops, who is then?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?
And then my "Southern States-Kellner" poses a question.
"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""
And I already want to say no, when two things are aware of:
First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't called me "kittens."
They call no one "kittens."
When did that happen?
I leave it, if I am on Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes.
"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""
And I say: "yes."
There is nothing special to this.
We play and their sisters stumbled, we laugh a lot and I'm reading quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."
Nothing exceptional.
But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the Summens, I cannot do anything but watch out.
I am focused.
I am quiet.
The country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.
Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wavering corals, and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" is releasing.
Everywhere is peace and simplicity.
The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.
I can hardly believe that I breathe.
Play is the opposite of works.
And I am happy.
Something inside me is dissolves.
A mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in.
And that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The sums come back slowly.
No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.
Not the sums, but a sums.
And now I feel, I would know a magical mystery.
But let's stay with the matter.
It is Love. that's all.
No magic. no secret. only love.
It's something we have forgotten.
The sums, the working men, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.
If I ask you who you are, if I'm telling you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.
The sums is no power and it is not labour-specific.
It depends on pleasure.
The real sums depends on love.
The sums is the stream, which comes from life's desire.
The real summs is self-awareness and peace.
The real sums ignores the pressure of the story, which to experience tasks, expectation and pressure.
The real sums is simple and original.
The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?
It's just love.
We all need a bit more love, much more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.
I make this a fixed rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.
It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice when I want to hear the sums again.
I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good at play, I don't like it.
Play is not based on how to work.
The truth is hurts,
But I don't like to play it.
I always work, because I love it.
I rather am at home as at home.
This concession is painful, because what a human being better than to be home?
Well, me.
Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --
I have to have problems.
That I am too relaxed is none of them.
We are in the garden around, and back and forth.
We make little dance parties,
We sing and play ball.
We burst soap bubbles.
I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.
I always take after my mobile phone.
But it is OK.
My children show me as you live, and the sums of the universe meets me.
I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever quit with the games?
You can do it too! if you want to play Yes, if your child wants to play with you.
Maybe you keep me for naive, for a day dreaming.
You probably have it right, but you can also do it!
You have time!
And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.
Your child will find you less interesting than you think.
It is only 15 minutes.
My little ones are going to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different.
It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Keks replaces me.
And I speak my teens-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.
It is only 15 minutes, more needs not.
Everyone can get 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad mood day!
15 minutes at a slice!
No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.
The day is short: dinner, the children are ready.
But 15 minutes are inside!
My children are my wellbeing, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.
It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,
"" "to play the" "" "games" "" "in general." ""
Allow yourself to indulge in 15 minutes!
Find out what you do well.
Find out and keep it out.
I'm not perfect in it. I'm leaving and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --
"do you want to play?" stands short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to see more and more.
15 minutes on a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?
What can be wrong? nothing!
The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.
Work doesn't work without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opened and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. she spends me into new ideas. I use it in full gulps and love my work again.
I like the sums, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.
Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.
This is my sums.
The sums of life.
The sums of love.
The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and so I am so grateful.
It is funny to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem.
I said Yes to less work and to more games.
And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children.
The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.
The more I play, the clearer is my head.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land that I run, the marathon, I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the sums of life: the sums of life.
The more I feel this sums, the more this makes this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more I!
The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.
I am an author. I think things I think you've got to life.
This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.
That is the dream of this job,
For a dream job should be a little dreamy.
"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "too less work and to play games." ""
Titans have no chance here.
"do you want to play?"
Thank you beautiful.
I am neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy.
I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.
For us neurosurgeon is it very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability for self healing.
After severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.
This is the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions.
Certainly, they have heard of one of the most well known, the "underground-brain stimulation." in this process, we implanted a electrode in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.
It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered severe tremor and severe pain.
However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure.
The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.
In my opinion, we approach this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With some help the brain can help themselves.
The story started 15 years ago.
At the time, I was Senior Consultant and working day and night in the emergency intake.
Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.
They have to imagine that in brain traumas, brain traumas and the skull pressure is inclined.
In order to save life, one must decrease the skull of skull.
Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.
Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.
What can I do with it?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not easy task.
To grow cells from a tissue paper, comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family.
You have to find the right food, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive it.
That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François abolished.
And he saw it under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.
Perhaps you know from the biologist classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small denominations of the brain.
It is surprising that this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP.
We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They were slowly but even after a few weeks, they even died.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but was different.
We needed a long time to understand where they came.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brain.
They make up 4% of our cerebellum cells.
They play an important role in our development.
At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.
But why will they get us?
We don't know that.
We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.
But this is not so secure.
One thing is clear, however -- by these cells we received our stem cells.
We are facing a potential cell source, that enables brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean-François did
And they then mark their colourfully, in order to be able to track them in the brain.
In the final step, we revived them at the entrance examination of the same individual.
We call the autologous transplant -- car transplant.
One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in cerebral brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routers, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken from after some weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario we add an injury and reimplanted the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.
Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that were reimplanted.
The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture.
We could not stop here.
Do these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual skill.
They had to take a tablet from one tablet.
They made it very good.
When they achieved a stable skill level, in the motor-motic Cortex we had reached the motor-motic area.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hands more.
Just as it would happen to people, they recovering spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recuperate with the help of plasticipher mechanisms. they are recovering to a certain degree, just like the apes.
When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degrees of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.
On the left, they see the monkeys, who spontaneously recovering.
It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.
It is not so precise and not so fast.
Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the matriation.
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.
Since that time, we found very much more about these cells.
We can freeze it and use later.
We can use it in other neuropathologic models, for example, in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream is still in implating people.
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal himself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."
I definitely need.
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can begin clinical trials on humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.
BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.
BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.
JB: that's hard to say.
First it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authority allow us to start it soon?
Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this type of treatment.
This must be applied to a multicenter study.
You must first understand that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.
BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.
BG: thank you very much.
Democracy.
In the West, we make a big mistake to look at them as of course.
We see democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.
We tend to consider them as an unchangeable geopenness.
We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That is not true.
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large imitators in Beijing have doubted that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is waning with us in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity schemes that were achieved in Greece.
At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.
At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.
I ask you, together with me again, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup had to believe in a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.
Without democracy, our companies are mastered, our future noblet, and our great, new technologies.
Regarding a wasting, I want to point out on an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.
I call it the "twin-summit paradox."
A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt of debt, which raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the whole world.
We all recognize the debt of the debt,
But only a few see his Didymus.
A mountain of unused cash, which, however, is too anxious to invest, however, to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt relief and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.
I call them two numbers.
Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound according to a lot of money until they were around with the equivalent of 5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and exchanted the property prices.
So, debt and unproductive capital form the twins summit, which are not equal through the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnating salaries, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, which will not invest a low demand that could not invest in which they do not invest in which they will not invest, that his son would kill him if he will grow up,
Unwanted the circumstances that causes that oipus kills him.
This is my sharks with capitalism --
Its extremely extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth.
So is democracy the solution?
I think. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?
Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government.
The Athenian democracy has, of course, too many.
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be an error to minimize the priority of athetic democracy due to these ascensions.
The decisive part of the Athenian democracy has been and is that she gave the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial, that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in questions of the state department.
The Athenian democracy has not kept long.
Like a candle that lights very bright, it is also burned down quickly.
However, our present liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,
But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.
While the Athenian democracy strengthened himself on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately became a statute for ruling.
Because the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy -- that was the world of the corporations -- a democratic reie zone.
"" "" "" "in our present democracies" "" "since the date of which this separation of politics and economy began, an unrelentless struggle between the two instead, taking the economy gradually the policy." ""
Are you wondering why politicians are not so much as before?
It is not part of its DNA degeneration.
It is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics into the economy is different and the areas are separated.
I mentioned my hair with capitalism.
If you think about it, it is like a herd of predatory animals, which is so sustainable the animals, of which she feeds, decimated that she is hungry at the end.
It is similar to the economy that explains politics so far, that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political goods is increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies.
The more successful capitalism distributes the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin-day summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the wealth of mankind.
If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigner.
This is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.
The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: creating the working arms!
Capitalism does it by replacing low gloom employed by automation and robot.
The problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate entities, the automation will be higher, the waste disposal, and the social conflicts below, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.
Thus, we must reunited the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we should democrat the reunified field, otherwise we can appear in a pathological monitoring of hyperdrive that will appear in the film "Matrix" as a documentary.
Therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --
The more interesting question is whether the capitalism resembles in "Star Trek" or something that the society in "Star Trek" is being resembled in the machines and put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, "in long talks the sense of life.
I think we must be optimistic.
So what's it like, how could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar Dystopia?
In practical implementation, I want to give you, in all short, some examples.
In the company's area: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is ownership of those who work currently in the company.
Then all income from capital and income from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.
No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not working in it, and employees who work there, to whom the company does not belong. no diving more between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and spending, and ultimately no empirical twin summit.
In the field of global political economy, please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 key emerging countries].
Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum to equal to trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a joint fund.
Imagine that this fund is invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where the investment is rare.
This is not a new idea.
It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.
The problem was that, at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.
Today, in particular, we found them, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy.
The world I describe you is more liberate in which they prefers to have privileged people, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.
But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.
We will wake up in such a world
Or will we drop into a "Matrix" - similar Dystopia?
The answer depends on how we decide to decide politically.
It is in our hands, and we are doing it better.
Thanks.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis...
You describe yourself in your biography himself as a liberal marxisten.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do not work, technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers described as "long term stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,
As well as Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.
BG: indeed, and now we are too.
YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.
BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation - YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinners of the speakers have you very clearly said what you keep from the point of view to China.
Do you want to repeat it here?
YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.
As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of the economy is, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone.
In a certain sense, if I may say that such provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.
Because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- that's an error, historically viewed.
Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --
He was particularly skeptical, affecting the democratic development.
What can be observed now in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
"" "" "" "China now cast out what the West has done in the 19th century, smells huge and hypocrisy." ""
BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of the beginning of the year.
YV: I heard that this comes.
BG: yes...
How do you look back six months later to the first half?
YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,
Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,
Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the sustained denial that a massive crossing-line through the eurozone went well, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union.
We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way it was the first proposal to revealed this denial --
Unfortunately, we have chosen the power within the eurozone, within the European group, to continue to deny the denial.
But you know what comes.
This is the experience of the Soviet Union --
If one tries to maintain a economic system that is not surviving, through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed even a while, but if then the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.
BG: what are you predicting?
YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone doesn't have a future when we do not change its structure.
BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?
YV: every day.
BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...
If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of financial investors to find a common solution.
But that wasn't.
They only wanted to take our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the distortion caused by the eurozone.
They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
There is worse than during "Great Depression."
None of the troika's troika, who has imposed this policy, confessed us: "this was a colosynchronous mistake."
BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: absolutely.
"" "" "" "my criticisms of the European Union and the Eurozone came to someone who lives and love Europe." ""
My biggest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.
"" "" "" "for if it does not survive, the freed forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union." ""
This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
"" "" "" "if we allow ourselves to suggest the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be" "" "the future of Europeans, as well as the non-Europeans." ""
BG: we hope that you lie wrong in this point.
Yanis, thank you so much that you were with TED.
YV: thanks.
Roy Price has never heard the majority, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for a lot of you.
That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios,
The TV production company at Amazon.
He is 47 years old, sleek, has a refreshment and describes on Twitter as a "movies, TV, technology, tacos."
Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce Amazon.
Of course, this is a very hard-fought branch.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any any.
He needs to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he must find shows that are located right at this corner.
This curve is the valuation distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained.
If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.
Then one has a successful show.
These are shows such as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted, where, after you saw a season, your brain asks: "where are there any more episodes?"
That kind of show.
On the left, here at this end, shows are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- you should tell you what at the end of the curve.
Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undertake "Toddler and Tiaras."
He makes more thoughts about the middle endurance, the average television - the shows that are not good nor bad, they just inspire them.
So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.
The print is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something like that. so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.
He wants to create achievements.
He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can look at each of them.
And if Amazon is free for nothing, you're attacking too, right?
Millions of spectators watching these episodes.
However, they don't know they are watched by watching this shows.
They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.
You record when you start the Show when you paused, which parts you skipping or check once again.
They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.
In fact, they collect the data, process this and this gives the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators."
They made this show.
Does anybody know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.
It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- therefore something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.
Around the same time at another company, another manager has plazated a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.
Instead of a competition, he and his team competed the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.
Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.
"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 evaluation at this curve. so exactly where they wanted.
Of course the question is: what is happening here?
One has two very competitive, data reversible companies.
They connect these many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.
Why is that?
Because the logic says somehow, that this should work with everything.
If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.
One has 200 years on statistics as back-up.
It is optimized by a very powerful computer.
The least thing you can expect is good television, right?
If data analysis doesn't work, then this is something horrifying because we are living in a time, in which we find more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television.
Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?
Nobody. OK, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.
If anyone asks in the US in prison and asks for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not.
Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad.
Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,
Not always created the best results. this is not because a company does not know how multi-health systems do not know how to use data.
The data vested firms are even wrong.
Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.
In 2009, Google announced that they can say, through data analysis of flu, the worse form, can be predicted -- through data analysis of Google research.
It worked wonderfully and was a great news statement. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "
It worked fine, year around the year, until it suddenly did not work,
And no one could say why.
It simply did not work, it was again a sensation when the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."
Even the data are diversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data improve in decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.
I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people may use inconceivable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern over the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern should be spread.
If you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:
As a result, put this problem into its components, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, you put the items together to obtain a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.
They are not suitable to relocate the parts, and then come to a decision.
There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.
If there is something that's good in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to receive a good resolution -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.
Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong to the process.
They use data to understand their audience better, for what they were otherwise unable to have been able. but the decision, how to put all these parts, put together again and make a show like "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.
Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.
They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were wettled by TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong if data start to control our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not forgetting that, this device is rather useful.
Many of you will...
Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.
Many know it.
It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.
I'll find it later with a technical demo.
So far I met some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in afterwards.
But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these by something much smarter, such as data analysis to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser. finally, it lies on us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.
And I feel this as a very heartening message that despite the great amount of data still paid out, decisions to make, a expert in that which one does, and risks.
Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.
Thank you beautiful.
