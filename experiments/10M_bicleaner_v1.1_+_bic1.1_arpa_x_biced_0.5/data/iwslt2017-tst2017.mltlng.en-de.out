that &apos;s James R@@ isen .
they may know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA lost illeg@@ ally by Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service operation where the CIA had literally so@@ rely on Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not feel at all ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and rep@@ elling journalists .
according to First Constitutional , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the sample they provide .
so when the government kno@@ cked out in R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , though they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and rail@@ ways to get statements , we could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and thus , investig@@ ators , without his consent , is worried about his phone conversation ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey ster@@ ling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ w@@ ling source .
unfortunately , it is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower at his insti@@ gate , but instead , justice has condemned to more than all U.S. governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government con@@ stituted too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security provided that a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers had to be a journalist .
thus , we put the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional proposition , because the government has more possibilities to pion@@ age all .
but just like technology of the government admitted to circum@@ vent rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources .
and even though they can contact them from the moment , in which they contact , instead of entering , in the witness .
today there are communication software that had not been written as R@@ isen had written a book , and it is considerably safer than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source release system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the author of the author , which was developed by us by Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news web site , such as the Washington Post here .
you can upload documents , or send documents , just like any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the corresponding news agency has access .
so the government cannot create more information in secret , and many of the information they would like , would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments will always develop new spy technologies all over the world .
it is in us to ensure that not only technology data like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility of mis@@ use ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
the lack of disp@@ utes in the supply of soldiers is modest and over@@ crowded in the hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the Alarm proposes to contam@@ inate the water of Flin@@ t . or an Wall@@ st @-@ Insider , that war@@ n us from the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of history has been revealed . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; &#91; enormous money &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s based law firm Mos@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we receive an impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys are going to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a ally owned by the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al @-@ Assad wrote tra@@ ilers in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend from kinder@@ g@@ ages , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others to wait for the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems cry out of you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and contribute to their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal more than ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always put it like a sail@@ or .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans so far , which came in these revel@@ ations , sc@@ andal .
well , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that you need fewer information in some US states to order less information to start a company as to get a library fee .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States has admitted to school children , school children .
it has allowed che@@ ers to pick up , especially vulnerable investors .
it is this type of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a secret investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers to bring susp@@ icious money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer from our investig@@ ator might make suggestions for transfer@@ ring his money .
these were all pre@@ moni@@ tions . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course there was no harm of this system . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who under@@ lined his secret investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not about a single top @-@ leading politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change rules to make this type of behaviour difficult .
this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything against it , as if anything is ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist I see that a lot has begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen priority to more transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has entered at national regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind here .
representatives of both parties have entered into two par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , as means used to ensure in the US and global for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which has now made this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Maced@@ onian .
a day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my gear .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in town and made straight road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land the trunk for a Maz@@ das .
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a air matt@@ resses . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I sp@@ elt down ?
a wild sleep in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , on Zeh@@ en@@ tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , is now on his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered ?
people on my air matt@@ resses has been normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses .
let us make a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , to attract my room@@ mates and the rent is increased .
I heard that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create it , fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Bed @-@ Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor at 20 dollars on the air floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham and om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and shut the door into the castle , Brian and I arrived .
did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into the rolls .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on which people share publicly images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closed when visiting .
on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited , that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we all lear@@ nt to children that foreigners are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you know about things that can be good . we were designed to layout .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence , between people who had never met before .
can design be done so ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I want to give you a cost sample , which degree can we penet@@ rate .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this soft@@ ly flight of panic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you &apos;ll see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a fore@@ ig@@ ner in your hands ?
most of the people feel responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
so who &apos;s actually Al Go@@ res handy ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he is de@@ composed for the office of the president ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
they have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have imag@@ ined with his name , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 evaluations , which all say : &quot; he can really hold off very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you have to deliver your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to pick negative evidence .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their pas@@ ties before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are at age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ sures .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if one has less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation is composed of simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we discovered that trust depend on how much you get from rate .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
tell too much , as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother . -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Great master@@ pieces in your apartment ! I &apos;ll do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design , creating these degrees in op@@ enness ?
we use the size of text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write something .
our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces opposite strangers .
with which we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than willing to cover these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need , which had previously been met before .
business is just very good for us .
of course there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been allowed to have part@@ ying parties , or have rav@@ aged apartments .
guests have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is hurt when I just think .
the dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of c@@ aller , was and will always be our motivation to improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fra@@ ction had a problem of 123 million in the 123 @-@ million overnight stays .
for people confi@@ ded right to each other .
when trust works , the wonder can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , who are incl@@ ined to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angel who can save life even though they don &apos;t know quite correctly .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay starts .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of part with money transactions work together ?
it is here about an economical trading .
but now just call &quot; rental industry &quot; will not be fair .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people have a part of itself open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less auth@@ en@@ tically .
what would , however , if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be ?
what if at any place that one would have visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a lot in a pub pent@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments of reason for sharing ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of a shared share ?
I imagine cities , which enable us to society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and destruction .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
have now been offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , over our platform , night 7@@ 85 000 people will be resident in 191 countries with a stranger or even hosting .
the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught .
we haven &apos;t invented the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work ?
apart from Happ@@ iness and Tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , subjected to a brain wear , a terrorist act ?
or just a delay at the airport &apos;s security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
thus , the media represent people that look like me .
a study showed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their u@@ ber @-@ drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker - double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ eg@@ rowing fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing : at that time , it was a feminist declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
I have del@@ ays with the Koran .
I read it , thought in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion , deep@@ ened at each of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes for weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feel that someone receives you , you fully understand , and somehow loves you ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptian , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Express announcement . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ out from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned itself quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should we do something ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Eastern descent ... &quot; ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the acts of others by one citizen in a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the U.S. west of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deeply it went in my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as the Muslim .
we moved into our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; rebu@@ ke you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably ridi@@ cul@@ ed , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims to become free .
there were really fire on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country , attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have picked the rage of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain permanently .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question is : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but an important organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , arous@@ al and Olymp@@ ion@@ ic risks .
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America be safer ?
there will perhaps be some parking fre@@ ih@@ on , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people other faith toler@@ ant , and show greater participation .
and as a director of the police in the Washington D.C. area recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in front of a computer .
at the radic@@ alization process , it has found that it begins online . as a result , the person can make a brain la@@ undering , even from their family , so that the person thinks that the terrorists are ab@@ h@@ or the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group is justified with the Koran as the IS .
as Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add us into their prec@@ urs@@ or , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but when you cast a look at her , she does not drive what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
a remarkable im@@ am told me a amazing history :
a girl came to him , because they are bright , to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , their sense for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
nothing inspi@@ res and something that had been given to their anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Im@@ am turned the connection to God and their church .
rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for a real shift in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept back to join the IS .
this was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear of fear of our democracy affect our freedom of freedom ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ enti@@ sts studies -- show : when we fear ourselves , at least three things happen .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian governance system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows that if you report test subjects news in which negative more than Muslims were reported , they voted more than military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims pushed forward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to elev@@ ate the foundation of a free society , rational and well informed citizens .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we feel it perhaps the first but the toxic air of fear van@@ es us all .
in the signing of collective inno@@ c@@ ence it is not just about to explain itself .

his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , the most generous person she knew .
she visited him there , and showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a w@@ asted young man from my breasts ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Suz@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon , as with an execution after he posted utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ atism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or stayed at home safely ?
we felt it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was about to let America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely choose our religion .
we decided to choose the mosque .
we set up with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , and went into the building hall , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am made a announcement , he than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , as half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came to attack us , but to help us .
in this moment , I am collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ smus ?
will you go safe at number ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I ask myself , what do you say that you think that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mem@@ orandum with depth , in a nostal@@ gic thought factory , an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ adi@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t fool . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually how it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever @-@ headed study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in any way an exception .
if humans appear as a rule , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ adi@@ ed .
what started as a hobby for Bast@@ ler , stands shortly before , to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ink@@ ers . possible , it is possible in research institutions around the world .
before air p@@ act enters our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a couple of years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting boxes , air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in narrow@@ est space .
you can also build self @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ed structures .
they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and react in general to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight .
in order to have an autonomous system , it must know collec@@ tively know where the mobile objects are located .
in our lab at ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic new tasks .
for the demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ spin of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , comp@@ ut@@ ting calculations on what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are at the highest eb@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flying unit tries to beat two flies with a f@@ lap .
like other starting flights it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great benefits for starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ vity is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence as wind turbines .
we develop new control and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered , and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask the basic abstract issues related to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts , which accum@@ ulate in order to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ der .
un@@ long we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and quer@@ ru@@ ders , no further actu@@ ators or controllers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the indoor life happens very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ rigid . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it exactly if all of you look on is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ bu@@ gger is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is more ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thereby he gets the greatest ability to receive ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some things happen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this revol@@ ves in clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly if limited .
we will now demonstrate that , making a half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of es@@ thetic expression .
we took retail micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with local technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate this demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine there would like to grow on the Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart si@@ ps to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential , the dot is on the i .
thank you very much .
over a 3 billion years ago in a very far distant Galaxy , two black holes are getting faster and they turned the mass three things in one t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy .
this short moment they lit up brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy they were not set free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ weight itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
arrange the events at first time .
over 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on earth .
since then , Earth has brought a lot more : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , humans and -- God arise - even the internet .
some 25 years ago , a group especially mut@@ ed -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to build a huge laser detector , to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a mad gen@@ ies that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely much hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer , gravity Observ@@ atory .
during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was greatly increased , which improved the detection performance enor@@ mously .
therefore we called it Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start of the det@@ ectors , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes passed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death .
in essence , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cra@@ p in the weight of space and time .
when moving the shaft , space and whole content are stretched to one direction and per@@ ched into the other .
to illustrate them , lec@@ turers lead to the rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a real al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us stretched the waves and gest@@ ures . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human average was 10 high -@@ 21 .
the name of 20 zer@@ os after Kom@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five kilometers long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length must be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear point . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ der@@ isch and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o be more than an eye than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking out of several points next light around you .
in the case that &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that means particularly much :
to the face of your child .
instead , we listen to specific properties like sound position and pitch , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind .
&quot; now just talk Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; number Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by taking changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , for Lig@@ o the measured frequency is in the audi@@ ble area .
so , if we convert the pattern to sound pattern , we can hear all literally .
the gravity of the gravity can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott are already busy .
SH : two black , no rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , you can hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional sound change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu .
it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - Lig@@ o said the following : &#91; Sur@@ render the noise &#93; that he knows what he must hear , this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as quickly as the rod of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s consider ourselves what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , orbit a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine the forces .
fantastic .
and we know , because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a whole new way to explore the Al@@ ls , as it was never possible before .
on this way , we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or in principle -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass @-@ birds explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about that .
the thri@@ lling physical processes happen , however , in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is hidden by its own neighbor .
using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to back up until the beginning .
and most import@@ antly , I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found just like the first run of things we had not expected .
my colleague , MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars , the black holes emerged as Lig@@ o is observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sour cherries for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different view of the events in all , towards the emergence of the stars , and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the space and cir@@ cling the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of whom I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , in unpleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on television ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , when I was afraid , did my fear .
my fears , to keep speaking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life on an unexpected species . it started with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
as if she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies , I need milk for my grab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was just on the leap . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I fain@@ ted to play with them as soon as you do . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an aston@@ ishing side effect : only recently , I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ agen to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things out , consider your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce TV .
I do television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programs , 70 @-@ hour television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show gives hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days to four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV channels , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , time four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of this 70 TV @-@ hours are programmes that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 @-@ hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , burning around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I want to im@@ press you with that .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re using a company , a country or a class@@ room , allow me to take a business or a class@@ room , so that I am not just about the computer , and fant@@ asi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that at a dream job do not dream of dreams .
it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I set up troops , I painted on a screen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , there &apos;s a high tone , delivered a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and ste@@ ad@@ orable , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable , and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there &apos;s such a change in me if the job works well .
a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could go to her forever .
many people assume that when I tell them the sum@@ s that I speak about writing that writing to me is joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work in television as I began to work and work , build up , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum , then you can not stri@@ ve to stri@@ ve to size .
the feeling that can not be different to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it means ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for the failure , and I just know that I love the sum .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make a clear question : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more excessive limits , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more things I write story , the more expectations exist .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love working , isn &apos;t it ?
the country that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that her mom@@ my is a single working law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per told people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
so what to do if that , what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know , some might think : &quot; cr@@ ite you , st@@ em@@ med the author Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do , you do , you are working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives a sum when you know the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States @-@ Kell@@ ner &quot; poses a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t called me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
they call no one &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I leave it , if I am on Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special to this .
we play and their sisters stum@@ bled , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m reading quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the Sum@@ mens , I cannot do anything but watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ vering cor@@ als , and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; is rele@@ asing .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me is dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel , I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working men , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I &apos;m telling you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream , which comes from life &apos;s desire .
the real sum@@ ms is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the story , which to experience tasks , expec@@ tation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I make this a fixed rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice when I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good at play , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not based on how to work .
the truth is hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather am at home as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a human being better than to be home ?
well , me .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we are in the garden around , and back and forth .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always take after my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me as you live , and the sum@@ s of the universe meets me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever quit with the games ?
you can do it too ! if you want to play Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ aming .
you probably have it right , but you can also do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones are going to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replaces me .
and I speak my te@@ ens @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs not .
everyone can get 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes at a slice !
no mobile , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well@@ being , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
allow yourself to indul@@ ge in 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and I victories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to see more and more .
15 minutes on a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opened and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . she sp@@ ends me into new ideas . I use it in full gul@@ ps and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and so I am so grateful .
it is funny to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything in handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land that I run , the marathon , I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think things I think you &apos;ve got to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too less work and to play games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon is it very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability for self healing .
after severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions .
certainly , they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; underground @-@ brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; in this process , we im@@ planted a electro@@ de in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time , I was Senior Consult@@ ant and working day and night in the emergency intake .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in brain trau@@ mas , brain trau@@ mas and the skull pressure is incl@@ ined .
in order to save life , one must decrease the skull of skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what can I do with it ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue paper , comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family .
you have to find the right food , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve it .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François abol@@ ished .
and he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with great green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the biolog@@ ist classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small denom@@ inations of the brain .
it is surprising that this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slowly but even after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but was different .
we needed a long time to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um cells .
they play an important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why will they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear , however -- by these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it was Jean @-@ François did
and they then mark their colour@@ fully , in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the final step , we revi@@ ved them at the entrance examination of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- car transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in cereb@@ ral brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ters , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken from after some weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we add an injury and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill .
they had to take a tablet from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they achieved a stable skill level , in the motor @-@ mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex we had reached the motor @-@ mot@@ ic area .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hands more .
just as it would happen to people , they re@@ covering spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate with the help of pl@@ asti@@ ci@@ ph@@ er mechanisms . they are re@@ covering to a certain degree , just like the ap@@ es .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degrees of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys , who spont@@ aneously re@@ covering .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ri@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use later .
we can use it in other neurop@@ ath@@ ologic models , for example , in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still in im@@ pl@@ ating people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely need .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this type of treatment .
this must be applied to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first understand that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West , we make a big mistake to look at them as of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changeable ge@@ op@@ enness .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have doub@@ ted that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity schemes that were achieved in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me again , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group had to believe in a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy .
without democracy , our companies are ma@@ stered , our future no@@ ble@@ t , and our great , new technologies .
regarding a w@@ asting , I want to point out on an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt of debt , which raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt of the debt ,
but only a few see his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which , however , is too anxi@@ ous to invest , however , to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt relief and also all the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound according to a lot of money until they were around with the equivalent of 5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and ex@@ chan@@ ted the property prices .
so , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twins summit , which are not equal through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating sal@@ aries , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , which will not invest a low demand that could not invest in which they do not invest in which they will not invest , that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ wanted the circumstances that causes that o@@ i@@ pus kills him .
this is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
its extremely extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has , of course , too many .
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to minim@@ ize the priority of ath@@ etic democracy due to these as@@ cen@@ sions .
the decisive part of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has been and is that she gave the working arms , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and crucial , that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of the state department .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long .
like a candle that lights very bright , it is also burned down quickly .
however , our present liberal democra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy strengthened himself on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling .
because the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics , while the economy -- that was the world of the corporations -- a democratic re@@ ie zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present democra@@ cies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the date of which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead , taking the economy gradually the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are not so much as before ?
it is not part of its DNA de@@ generation .
it is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics into the economy is different and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ory animals , which is so sustainable the animals , of which she feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that she is hungry at the end .
it is similar to the economy that explains politics so far , that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political goods is increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ day summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the wealth of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the fore@@ ig@@ ner .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low glo@@ om employed by automation and robot .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate entities , the automation will be higher , the waste disposal , and the social conflicts below , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
thus , we must re@@ united the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we should democra@@ t the re@@ unified field , otherwise we can appear in a path@@ ological monitoring of hyper@@ drive that will appear in the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether the capitalism resem@@ bles in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; or something that the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; is being resem@@ bled in the machines and put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , &quot; in long talks the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what &apos;s it like , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you , in all short , some examples .
in the company &apos;s area : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is ownership of those who work currently in the company .
then all income from capital and income from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they are not working in it , and employees who work there , to whom the company does not belong . no diving more between capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and spending , and ultimately no empi@@ rical twin summit .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 key emerging countries &#93; .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum to equal to trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a joint fund .
imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where the investment is rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that , at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , in particular , we found them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe you is more liber@@ ate in which they pre@@ fers to have privileged people , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we drop into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we are doing it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography himself as a liberal mar@@ xi@@ sten .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do not work , technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation - Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinners of the speakers have you very clearly said what you keep from the point of view to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of the economy is , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say that such pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically viewed .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical , affecting the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now cast out what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge and hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I heard that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the sustained den@@ ial that a massive crossing @-@ line through the euro@@ zone went well , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way it was the first proposal to revealed this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , we have chosen the power within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , to continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain a economic system that is not survi@@ ving , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may be delayed even a while , but if then the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what are you predic@@ ting ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone doesn &apos;t have a future when we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not make mistakes , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of financial investors to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
they only wanted to take our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the di@@ stortion caused by the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who has imposed this policy , conf@@ essed us : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my critic@@ isms of the European Union and the Eurozone came to someone who lives and love Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the freed forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to suggest the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you lie wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were with T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
Roy Price has never heard the majority , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for a lot of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company at Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sle@@ ek , has a refresh@@ ment and describes on Twitter as a &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any any .
he needs to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right at this corner .
this curve is the valuation distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows such as &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where , after you saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more episodes ? &quot;
that kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- you should tell you what at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ take &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle endurance , the average television - the shows that are not good nor bad , they just inspire them .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something like that . so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create achievements .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can look at each of them .
and if Amazon is free for nothing , you &apos;re attacking too , right ?
millions of spectators watching these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are watched by watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the Show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you ski@@ pping or check once again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this gives the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- therefore something over the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
around the same time at another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ated a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team comp@@ eted the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a w@@ agon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 evaluation at this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data reversible companies .
they connect these many data together and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because the logic says somehow , that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years on statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good television , right ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is something horri@@ fying because we are living in a time , in which we find more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if anyone asks in the US in prison and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always created the best results . this is not because a company does not know how multi @-@ health systems do not know how to use data .
the data v@@ ested firms are even wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can say , through data analysis of flu , the worse form , can be predicted -- through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news statement . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around the year , until it suddenly did not work ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , it was again a sensation when the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are diversi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data improve in decisions of life -- at work , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people may use in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some pattern over the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and un@@ successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a result , put this problem into its components , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , you put the items together to obtain a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ locate the parts , and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that &apos;s good in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces together again , even if the information is in@@ complete to receive a good resolution -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better , for what they were otherwise unable to have been able . but the decision , how to put all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were w@@ ett@@ led by TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong if data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not for@@ getting that , this device is rather useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I &apos;ll find it later with a technical demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball in afterwards .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace these by something much smar@@ ter , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it lies on us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very hear@@ tening message that despite the great amount of data still paid out , decisions to make , a expert in that which one does , and risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
