<seg id="1">That's James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA lost illegally by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service operation where the CIA had literally sorely on Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not feel at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol of the government's pattern to condemn Whistleblower and repelling journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the sample they provide.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked out in Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and railways to get statements, we could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus, investigators, without his consent, is worried about his phone conversation,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crawling source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, it is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower at his instigate, but instead, justice has condemned to more than all U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government constituted too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security provided that a whistleblowers had to be a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional proposition, because the government has more possibilities to pionage all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology of the government admitted to circumvent reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And even though they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact, instead of entering, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that had not been written as Risen had written a book, and it is considerably safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source release system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the author of the author, which was developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news web site, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents, or send documents, just like any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the corresponding news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot create more information in secret, and many of the information they would like, would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments will always develop new spy technologies all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is in us to ensure that not only technology data like Edward Snowden have a possibility of misuse iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of disputes in the supply of soldiers is modest and overcrowded in the hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the Alarm proposes to contaminate the water of Flint. or an Wallst-Insider, that warn us from the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to discover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the largest data leck of history has been revealed.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that Reiche and Mighty] [enormous money] have been hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to a statement.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's based law firm Mosseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We receive an impression of how customers, banks and attorneys are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally owned by the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad wrote trailers in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend from kindergages, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others to wait for the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cry out of you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and contribute to their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a sailor.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans so far, which came in these revelations, scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle, after which these tax havases work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need fewer information in some US states to order less information to start a company as to get a library fee.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States has admitted to school children, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheers to pick up, especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a secret investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers to bring suspicious money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer from our investigator might make suggestions for transferring his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all premonitions. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course there was no harm of this system. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who underlined his secret investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top-leading politicians, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change rules to make this type of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything against it, as if anything is ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen priority to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has entered at national registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have entered into two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as means used to ensure in the US and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headships.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency, which has now made this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Macedonian.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my gear.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in town and made straight road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse," "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land the trunk for a Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I spelt down?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, on Zehentips to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, is now on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattresses has been normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, to attract my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I heard that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay on a designer Bed and Bed-Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air floor at 20 dollars on the air floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham and omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and shut the door into the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website, on which people share publicly images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited, that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learnt to children that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you know about things that can be good. we were designed to layout.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be done so?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a cost sample, which degree can we penetrate.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This softly flight of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you'll see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of the people feel responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So who's actually Al Gores handy?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is decomposed for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined with his name, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 evaluations, which all say: "he can really hold off very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you have to deliver your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to pick negative evidence.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their pasties before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pressures.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three convictions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is composed of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we discovered that trust depend on how much you get from rate.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tell too much, as for example, "I have problems with my mother. -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great masterpieces in your apartment! I'll do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, creating these degrees in openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices opposite strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to cover these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need, which had previously been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Business is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been allowed to have partying parties, or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is hurt when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which you hear in the voice of caller, was and will always be our motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction had a problem of 123 million in the 123-million overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided right to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, the wonder can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who are inclined to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who can save life even though they don't know quite correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay starts.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of part with money transactions work together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economical trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now just call "rental industry" will not be fair.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People have a part of itself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would, however, if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place that one would have visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a lot in a pub pentour neighborhood, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments of reason for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of a shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities, which enable us to society and relations, instead of loneliness and destruction.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Have now been offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, over our platform, night 785 000 people will be resident in 191 countries with a stranger or even hosting.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We haven't invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from Happiness and Timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, subjected to a brain wear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay at the airport's security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus, the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their uber-drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker - double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seegrowing fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have delays with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought in question, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion, deepened at each of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes for weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feel that someone receives you, you fully understand, and somehow loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptian, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had dinner at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Express announcement."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people spout from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned itself quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"...,... "... in the name of Islam..."... "Eastern descent..."... "...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it was not only my country attacked, but in the Nu transformed me the acts of others by one citizen in a suspects." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the U.S. west of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deeply it went in my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be alert," "be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "rebuke you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably ridiculed, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims to become free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country, attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have picked the rage of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain permanently.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and join mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question is: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, arousal and Olympionic risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques of America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will perhaps be some parking freihon, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people other faith tolerant, and show greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a director of the police in the Washington D.C. area recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radicalization process, it has found that it begins online. as a result, the person can make a brain laundering, even from their family, so that the person thinks that the terrorists are abhor the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group is justified with the Koran as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add us into their precursor, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you cast a look at her, she does not drive what they are in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A remarkable imam told me a amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they are bright, to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, their sense for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspires and something that had been given to their anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real shift in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept back to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, like the Islamophobia and my family concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear of fear of our democracy affect our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientists studies -- show: when we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian governance system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if you report test subjects news in which negative more than Muslims were reported, they voted more than military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims pushed forward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to a Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to elevate the foundation of a free society, rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel it perhaps the first but the toxic air of fear vanes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the signing of collective innocence it is not just about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was very promising at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say that he was the sweetest, the most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a wasted young man from my breasts?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon, as with an execution after he posted utterances against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We felt it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was about to let America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely choose our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to choose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We set up with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, and went into the building hall, and what I saw was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a announcement, he thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came to attack us, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatismus?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go safe at number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what do you say that you think that you are holding a TEDTalk, a memorandum with depth, in a nostalgic thought factory, an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogadied: I would say you don't fool. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually how it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever-headed study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in any way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If humans appear as a rule, the rule is often broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogadied.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a hobby for Bastler, stands shortly before, to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drinkers. possible, it is possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pact enters our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a couple of years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting boxes, air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-tensioned structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and react in general to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to have an autonomous system, it must know collectively know where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic new tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offspin of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, computting calculations on what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are at the highest ebe. g." "" "and" "" "landing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying unit tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starting flights it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and thus has great benefits for starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgevity is that they react sensitively to turbulence as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new control and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered, and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask the basic abstract issues related to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts, which accumulate in order to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and querruders, no further actuators or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the indoor life happens very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-rigid. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it exactly if all of you look on is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monbugger is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is more ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he gets the greatest ability to receive,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things happen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propellers-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that, making a half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of esthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took retail micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate this demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine there would like to grow on the Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart sips to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential, the dot is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Over a 3 billion years ago in a very far distant Galaxy, two black holes are getting faster and they turned the mass three things in one tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit up brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy they were not set free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time-weight itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Over 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has brought a lot more: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God arise - even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group especially muted -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector, to look for gravitational waves, which arise through collidizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a mad genies that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely much hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer, gravity Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was greatly increased, which improved the detection performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we called it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start of the detectors, the gravitation waves of the two collidizing black holes passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied Gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories such as Ligo measurable signals. what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crap in the weight of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, space and whole content are stretched to one direction and perched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate them, lecturers lead to the relativity-theory often a real albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us stretched the waves and gestures. the elongation of an average human average was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">The name of 20 zeros after Komma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometers long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length must be measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear point. that is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finderisch and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo be more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking out of several points next light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case that's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that means particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">To the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to specific properties like sound position and pitch, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just talk Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by taking changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, for Ligo the measured frequency is in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So, if we convert the pattern to sound pattern, we can hear all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott are already busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, no rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, you can hear the same cirpen with an additional sound change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - Ligo said the following: [Surrender the noise] that he knows what he must hear, this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as quickly as the rod of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider ourselves what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 probes, orbit a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine the forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know, because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a whole new way to explore the Alls, as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or in principle -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mass-birds explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about that.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes happen, however, in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is hidden by its own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitation waves, it should be possible to back up until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found just like the first run of things we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague, MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars, the black holes emerged as Ligo is observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour cherries for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different view of the events in all, towards the emergence of the stars, and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the space and circling the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year, I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "in front of whom I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, when I was afraid, did my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fears, to keep speaking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life on an unexpected species. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all unexplainable reasons all "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "cookies, I need milk for my grab." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her, when I was just on the leap. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This is the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I fainted to play with them as soon as you do. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently, I understood that the "Yes" Sagen to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things out, consider your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70-hour television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show gives hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days to four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV channels, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, time four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hours are programmes that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70-hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you're using a company, a country or a classroom, allow me to take a business or a classroom, so that I am not just about the computer, and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that at a dream job do not dream of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "it is, when I set up troops, I painted on a screen." ""</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, there's a high tone, delivered a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and steadorable, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, and the best thing is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There's such a change in me if the job works well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could go to her forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I tell them the sums that I speak about writing that writing to me is joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work in television as I began to work and work, build up, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sum, then you can not strive to strive to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that can not be different to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it means ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for the failure, and I just know that I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear question: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more excessive limits, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more things I write story, the more expectations exist.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, overdone, burned, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mommy is a single working law.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper told people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what to do if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some might think: "crite you, stemmed the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you do, you are working to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives a sum when you know the sums when the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States-Kellner" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't called me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no one "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I leave it, if I am on Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special to this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters stumbled, we laugh a lot and I'm reading quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the Summens, I cannot do anything but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wavering corals, and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" is releasing.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel, I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working men, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I'm telling you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream, which comes from life's desire.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real summs is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of the story, which to experience tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a fixed rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice when I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good at play, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not based on how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at home as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a human being better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are in the garden around, and back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me as you live, and the sums of the universe meets me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever quit with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! if you want to play Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naive, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have it right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones are going to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I speak my teens-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at a slice!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. you don't have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play the" "" "games" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself to indulge in 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm leaving and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to see more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opened and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. she spends me into new ideas. I use it in full gulps and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and so I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is funny to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon is it very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability for self healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the most well known, the "underground-brain stimulation." in this process, we implanted a electrode in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was Senior Consultant and working day and night in the emergency intake.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in brain traumas, brain traumas and the skull pressure is inclined.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one must decrease the skull of skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What can I do with it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue paper, comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right food, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François abolished.</seg>
<seg id="825">And he saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with great green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biologist classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small denominations of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly but even after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play an important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why will they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- by these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark their colourfully, in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step, we revived them at the entrance examination of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- car transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in cerebral brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Routers, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken from after some weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we add an injury and reimplanted the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take a tablet from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, in the motor-motic Cortex we had reached the motor-motic area.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hands more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovering spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recuperate with the help of plasticipher mechanisms. they are recovering to a certain degree, just like the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degrees of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys, who spontaneously recovering.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the matriation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we found very much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathologic models, for example, in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still in implating people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely need.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">This must be applied to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first understand that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a big mistake to look at them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable geopenness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large imitators in Beijing have doubted that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is waning with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity schemes that were achieved in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me again, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup had to believe in a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our companies are mastered, our future noblet, and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding a wasting, I want to point out on an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt of debt, which raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt of the debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few see his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which, however, is too anxious to invest, however, to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt relief and also all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound according to a lot of money until they were around with the equivalent of 5.1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and exchanted the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debt and unproductive capital form the twins summit, which are not equal through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating salaries, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, which will not invest a low demand that could not invest in which they do not invest in which they will not invest, that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances that causes that oipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy has, of course, too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to minimize the priority of athetic democracy due to these ascensions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive part of the Athenian democracy has been and is that she gave the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial, that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in questions of the state department.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very bright, it is also burned down quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy strengthened himself on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy -- that was the world of the corporations -- a democratic reie zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our present democracies" "" "since the date of which this separation of politics and economy began, an unrelentless struggle between the two instead, taking the economy gradually the policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are not so much as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of its DNA degeneration.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics into the economy is different and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predatory animals, which is so sustainable the animals, of which she feeds, decimated that she is hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that explains politics so far, that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political goods is increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin-day summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low gloom employed by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate entities, the automation will be higher, the waste disposal, and the social conflicts below, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus, we must reunited the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we should democrat the reunified field, otherwise we can appear in a pathological monitoring of hyperdrive that will appear in the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">Therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether the capitalism resembles in "Star Trek" or something that the society in "Star Trek" is being resembled in the machines and put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, "in long talks the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what's it like, how could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you, in all short, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is ownership of those who work currently in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not working in it, and employees who work there, to whom the company does not belong. no diving more between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and spending, and ultimately no empirical twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 key emerging countries].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum to equal to trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country in a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where the investment is rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that, at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, in particular, we found them, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is more liberate in which they prefers to have privileged people, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop into a "Matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography himself as a liberal marxisten.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do not work, technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand, which Larry Summers described as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation - YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinners of the speakers have you very clearly said what you keep from the point of view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of the economy is, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I may say that such provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- that's an error, historically viewed.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, affecting the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China now cast out what the West has done in the 19th century, smells huge and hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I heard that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the sustained denial that a massive crossing-line through the eurozone went well, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way it was the first proposal to revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, we have chosen the power within the eurozone, within the European group, to continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain a economic system that is not surviving, through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed even a while, but if then the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what are you predicting?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone doesn't have a future when we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of financial investors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to take our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the distortion caused by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika's troika, who has imposed this policy, confessed us: "this was a colosynchronous mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticisms of the European Union and the Eurozone came to someone who lives and love Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if it does not survive, the freed forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>

<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard the majority, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for a lot of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, sleek, has a refreshment and describes on Twitter as a "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right at this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows such as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted, where, after you saw a season, your brain asks: "where are there any more episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">That kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- you should tell you what at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undertake "Toddler and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle endurance, the average television - the shows that are not good nor bad, they just inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something like that. so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can look at each of them.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free for nothing, you're attacking too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are watched by watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the Show when you paused, which parts you skipping or check once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this gives the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- therefore something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Around the same time at another company, another manager has plazated a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team competed the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 evaluation at this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data reversible companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic says somehow, that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years on statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work, then this is something horrifying because we are living in a time, in which we find more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks in the US in prison and asks for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always created the best results. this is not because a company does not know how multi-health systems do not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data vested firms are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can say, through data analysis of flu, the worse form, can be predicted -- through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news statement. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around the year, until it suddenly did not work,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, it was again a sensation when the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are diversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data improve in decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people may use inconceivable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern over the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, put this problem into its components, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, you put the items together to obtain a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to relocate the parts, and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that's good in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to receive a good resolution -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better, for what they were otherwise unable to have been able. but the decision, how to put all these parts, put together again and make a show like "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were wettled by TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not forgetting that, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll find it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these by something much smarter, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser. finally, it lies on us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very heartening message that despite the great amount of data still paid out, decisions to make, a expert in that which one does, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
