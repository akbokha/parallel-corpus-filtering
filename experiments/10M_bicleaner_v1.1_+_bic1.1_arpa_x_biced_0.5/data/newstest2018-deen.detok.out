Munich, 1856: four maps that change your view to the city
An Irish institution, where young people are meeting today.
A seftkapelle, where the S-Bahn tunnel will be dug.
Small farmers work the rusty reason of farmers.
The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.
It is annoying when maps are not currently current.
This knows everyone who had to be exciting already because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a rectiring road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offering of the geoportals in Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but therefore very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the broader area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickentepatic, which one can not recognize as such.
The great coverage map were set up for cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called pristings.
These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration, between 1810 and 1864, and of the first surveying Bayerns.
Your client: Napoleon.
Since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second World War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally pulled off the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a wide-wide Bavaria card.
KurfürstMax IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The Urgency Award for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the others found on the Bavarian State Library's website.
The comparison morning / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has extended itself into all directions and has grown together.
One example is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.
Sendling was granted 21 years after drawing up the map, in 1877, as the district of Munich.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of the houses are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in 1705.
Where today the West park is, you can see nothing but fields - at the first sight: in the Hineinzooming, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called 'Urbino, "which was derived from the basic tax.
Small parcels do not prove to farmers more - but small gardeners of the complex "land in the sun."
A large green space is characterised by the north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
On the contrary, in the area of the present district, Au-Haidhausen can not only read the street names "at the" Gasteig "or by the front" on the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one has once locked people with madments.
There was the Munich Circle-Irpension at the Auer Lübeck in 1858 / 59.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder, headed by the establishment of the psychiatrist, led by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"" "" "" "he was advanced to his time and ended for example the Chains of the so-called Irren." ""
In addition, he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients had been first place, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for building the Kreisky penitentiary in the hair of 1905.
There is the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.
Youngsters on the former Auer Ward is now going to meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with a training course.
To the west is the soccer field of TSV Munich East, east residential houses of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - built in a architectonic way to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during WWII during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was named "Head Square," the Kaufingerway was named "Kaufinger lane."
The Second World War led to the heart of the Second World War.
The allies of the Allies broke out many holes in December 1944.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days work on and on 5 April 2017 on the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station.
With the shooting gallery, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Published Travel Guide for Missouri
The National Association for the promotion of farms has issued a warning for colored human beings who are travelling due to discriminating policy and racist attacks by the state of Missouri.
"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal state of Missouri, which is alleged until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourced, as a number of fragility, racial presence in the whole state can be noticed and stated here," "" "says the Group's opinion." ""
A recent adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as prosecuting minorities of the state, which cause disproportionate the group to publish the journey, said the NAACP.
"" "" "" "they have violations of the citizens of citizenship that happen to humans." ""
They will be stopped because of their skin color, they are put together or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard." "" "" ""
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group of events such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and Death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state of Missouri, and was accused of accused of crimes of crime.
The Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri, which showed that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.
"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff of what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""
"" "" "" "people have to be willing to bring along the money money or the relatives, that they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes according to the latest numbers from the FBI, the FBI, which ranks the state in regards to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had adopted itineraries for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed, the local prosecuting authorities were committed to repaid people because of immigration defects, which will contribute to the further expansion of the ACLU.
Travel maintenance are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.
Electric fence project is elementary
The fishing bacher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the rectory court of the Schwendemann family met representatives of the fishing bacher CDU-suburban together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into its operation, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young are accommodated and accommodated in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, so swivel.
On the table of the most beautiful, it is entirely regional.
Since he also described the BLHV-Chairman of Fishbach, it also described the fence project as "elementar."
I can't generate so steep surfaces on derart.
The green space for a lot of work, must be processed using the brushcutter.
"" "" "" "we have been struggling with the terms and the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""
In 2003, he took over the elteristic operation and use this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leaders promotion."
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers should be supported.
One hope that the capacity of the surface could still be pulled out for a while.
"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and to make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "says the mayor." ""
Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 on the electric fence.
The open space area amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be choosen up to at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was funded by leader, a quarter brought the village of Fishbach.
Consequently, the farmers had to invest 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of consecrated.
"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and virgins."
"" "also for Peter Weiß:" "" "there are best foods produced here." "" "" ""
The state-level of agriculture (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of fences.
The finish is the disclosure of the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is a prone by the lpr.
In addition, the fence does not have to be volatile (Hanging above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the disarmament.
For the fishing bacher electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.
The open space is equivalent to 35 hectares, with a total cost of more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest mark of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.
The Americans like each other - as well as each other - the sorrowed fall of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologist of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hot quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president to drastic limitations of the legal migration of the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.
A horde by boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have had it, if he had done it.
But he attacked her importance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to, as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his basis was added.
"" "when Miller Acosta complain," "" "I don't want to go on a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American liberty which lights the world." ""
The poem, which you refer to, was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "
Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about contemporary resonance on the changing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your waste, your poor, and your necessary masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the elight waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time in which the "eleventh trash" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.
This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who started to place their words after their death at the base - was very good that they did a high political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.
And there is a very different name: mother of the exiles.
The compound of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change it long from right wing.
The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty has no one invite, but rather an early neo-conservative, who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.
It is said to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The torch is not to shine the way into the United States. "
Quite unusual, Limbaugh is encountered here.
The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the perception of the perception.
The great phantastic act of Lazarus was to see them as they see from the exhausted, elly, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, to see the world from perspective of people, seek refuge and give a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.
And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever wanted to recognize.
Her torch shall not shine on the way, but hatred that is the only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schotts belonged to the UK team.
"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship title" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special was developed in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it.
"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue to continue until we find it," "" "said Black." ""
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think that something has to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy in the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butten, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance while Eiliie Doyle was chosen by the team captain.
"Eiliie is quite modest.
Her captain word was incredible, "says Black.
"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie brought all of course were magnificent. "
The Commonwealth Silbermedaillenev, who will compete in its fifth world championships for the 400-m hurdles, says it "incredible" that 16 Schotts are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, who were met in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance of Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell was.
The capitalist capital says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only belonging to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals.
"" "" "" "the special feature of team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, making it something special for me," "" "she added." ""
"obviously I am very proud of all the gravel who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to poets.
What my speech as captain affects?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion.
I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere there outside. "
Block Critics via Facebook: do not work for a public office, if you cannot bear the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something from bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the Domestic Policy to his political principles.
He stumbled upon criticism, certainly.
But he didn't make his critics silence.
"" "because in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, as sheep are led to the slaughter." "" "" ""
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it, to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sent him so early this week.
The governor of the Governor, dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?"
"" "" "" "it is only Facebook" "", "many people said." ""
But it is important.
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a strong hand at the leadership of its state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary resources to connect with his voters and playing his haunless head to chemotherapy on its side.
Therefore, blocking of persons who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially, and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Spreader Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor, arguing that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of cast or spammers or water filled people who swaying the whip online.
The Post talked with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and unprofane.
The priest renounced the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD, was not satisfied, but she asked to hate them.
"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on hate and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news statement" The Post. "" ""
"" "" "" "I really appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same subject takes place, then it will be recognized by some more than a collective collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""
What the Governors of the Governor referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "interceticism."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment.
It's a lot more cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conductors to burn, or to silence demonstrators, or to silence demonstrators.
But exactly what is happening in digital.
Hogan is not the first public officials to criticised that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the first asparment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voters from their Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the period of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers contributed between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous letter proposed to its leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who use pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters of newspapers, Washington's decisions.
Petitions which have criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents published by the George Washington Project.
But he didn't make her silence.
Freedom of expression, opinion of opinion and discourses belong to our nation's foundation.
And true guidance, that means to accept this.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, they don't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai rule, the housewife usually denotes a sweet potato - locally called "Nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour the stolen crisy is taken from eagerly, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries their daily work, Z. B. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless area serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, you were not assigned to fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late at work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers.
"" "" "" "no one finds it, after 17 o'clock in the village," "" "she says." ""
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua New Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, as only 1,026 elders have to vote in front of the occupying troops.
An existing movement used for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, who maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea's eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as dislocation as it is desolate. the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the province Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the car rental.
There are no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs, which were transformed by groost in different gelbbrown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, except journalists and practically no foreigner.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans identified a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"" "" "" "we were not used to wear these clothes," "" "says Degei and points to her lively, handwoven turban, their dark shirt and bright rock." ""
"we only had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua New province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children's death and literacy rates in Asia.
But Indonesia is also Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, lies only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland provincial in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport was mined by 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua New electricity resources has an estimated $78 billion worth in excess of $78 billion.
These wealth, however, are a source of misery for the Papua New, ensuring that Indonesia's mighty military preserves a suffocative presence.
An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport had paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer.
Papal receivables according to larger autonomy threaten the golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua New Guinea were killed and thousands have been raped by the Indonesian military since 1969, tortured and imprisoned.
Investigations in Papuas tribe-high land in the 1970-s were charged with genocide according to the Asia-Convention Commission for genocide.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"" "" "" "we Werden Everything" "" "is called the Archdiocese Brisbane from 2016, in which reports about atrocities of the previous year are, such as illegal execution and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations." ""
"it is difficult to count the number of victims, since every week incidents," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Screws have intensified, since Papuas resources bring resources from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% of Christian, but the demographic development is changing since Muslim business migrant from the most populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese wary cantons sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables with peanut sauce served.
Local people fight to stay here.
"" "" "" "migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea," "" "Abeth You, a 24 year old Paniai-native, who moved to the province of Jayapura." ""

The Indonesian president Joko Widodo, known in the Volksmund than Jokowi, promised the inequalities and legal injuries in Papua New campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter, 27 of the 29 districts of Papua New Guinea, including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua New Zealand changed little, and today the locals feel cheated.
"our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jokowi for 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a depth of two months after Jokowis's inauguration in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas carols in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness.
The rocking children told them that they should turn off their headlights.
One of the soldiers came back to their tone, and later came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had drunk, pursued and struck the group with their rifle, said victims and witnesses.
Then he fired one of the soldiers into the children's group.
A child who was 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten, that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua New men, women and children gathered for a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to call justice.
They wore crushed hunting grounds and carried the Waita dance - in circles continuously and a bird-singing - from Papuas Mee Pago-tribe.
Some demonstrators began to drag stones to police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent to an internal radio command: "if the masses have more than three times, they shoot them dead," says it in an official document of TIME, which was not released the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
Nobody was to listen in the mood.
"when I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left hand," he said Timo E on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who has fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"it was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native guy Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shooting was.

"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The cheekeepers of the Papua New Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they will be attacked.
"" "" "" "we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," "" "said spokesperson for the Papua New Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015." ""
"it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings came first 'to Jakarta in the following day.
In Jayapura's three weeks, Jokowi kept a passionate speech in which he had uttered sympathies for the families of the victims and weakens the historical misfortune in Papua New Guinea.
"" "" "" "I would like that this case will be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," "" "he said." ""
In October 2016, the Wiranto Security Minister, said that he set out an extrajudicial mechanism for settlement of historic human rights violations.
But the pronunciation began almost immediately.
"most injuries have occurred before a long time.
Some were in the 90 "s and early 2000 years.
The point is that we have committed to address these violations, but there are processes that need to pass through, "he said.
Then, Wiranto did a retreat when he spoke at Jakarta with TIME at the 5th of June in Jakarta with TIME and said he did not establish any plans in Papua New Complaint mechanism.
Instead, all is regulated by law, "he said.
Wiranto, which demanded the UN for crimes against humanity, called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence of independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights abuses were settled in Papua New Guinea, including the Paniai stock.
Families of the Paniai victims were contrary to those claims with grimmers unbeliever.
"I interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I am afraid," he says.
"" "" "" "I am afraid to be arrested by the military, I am afraid to be shot." "" "" ""
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military, after he helped four of the victims to bury.
"" "" "" "after I was buried the corpses, the military searched for me," "" "he says." ""
The shooters have not ceased.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police set on the villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a farmer who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others died, including children.
The man, born 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fisher in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The villagers protested the company's site office.
The police said that the villagers cast their officers on officers, which reacted by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting down and slew a slew.
"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be vengeance," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured one has been delivered quickly, so the TIME.
"I have hidden me two days in my house."
"" "" "" "the Deiyai Parliament called on to withdraw the involved officers to take account and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police." ""
Paniai was always an unrude for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua New Guinea.
Many joined the "Free Papua New Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of the Papua New Guinea by pushing sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people arrested in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken in custody under the pretext of "securing the national sovereignty."
Some diving never again.
Among the people in Papua New Zealand is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.
The little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of range.
The people here build everything they eat: above all emergencies and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato-potatoes each.
Keep the bulk of the harvest for the family, while the rest on the local market is sold.
Ten pieces of Nota were only 10.000 indonese rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua New and the new migrants who have arrived on the Nabire airport in a larger number since the opening of new flights.
The few jobs, which are in the region, usually go to the better trained and wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely, the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive.
"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairwoman of Paniai.
Isolation holds the eyes of the world from Papua New Guinea.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media are eagerly anticipating.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Guinea, although the rare permission was given to films.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development.
"" "" "" "there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unrest eastern provinces of Papua New and Western papua: Visa Sponsor and a black list," "" "he said in an explanation." ""
The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours Papuas.
In March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshallele and the Salomons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council, to examine the "various and widely spread injuries" in Papua New and the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically been supported by OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir spokesman back to the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to have the evidence for human rights violations."
People in front of the place want more foreign governments take this to know.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura broke their silence and urged him, "We want freedom," according to a source that would also participate in the meeting, but anonymous.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the Papua New adaptation that they will probably not be able to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribe.
He wants to know that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a common military, is living in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua New Papua New Guinea, consider her voice for Jokowi as a "guilt," he must pay back.
"they don't need money, they only want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai-firearm received a last symbolic act of spite: the body of a victim was buried in an grounds opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they might never return to justice, but at least, they don't forget their crimes.
"a member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with special head.
"what else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world's highest residential doors in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents, from the 337 m high, 79-story buildings to flee.
It is the second fire that sweeps in just two years by the high-house, which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower (torch Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom, "said a resident who told his name as George angab, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) took place the fire and cooled down the building.
The government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages from the cladding, the outdoor clothing to decoration or insulation, came.
In Great Britain, the police said they believe that the system could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire on the London Grenfell tower in June, where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: continue Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has fallen by his big Davis Cup-coup at the general meeting.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, this Sport-revolutionary proposal, Davis Cup single was only allowed to play two paragraphs, skin-thin not supported by the required two-third majority.
The fact that is often very long, but also very estimated five-rate classic stay the traditional score.
63.54% of member countries voted for reform, the purpose of ITF-President David Hagelty, therefore only scarcely missed.
"we respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
"" "we need a change to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historical contests," "" "said Hagelty." ""
I will continue to work to improve the values.
Not only for the vote, after many inconsistencies before the proposal reached the final in a neutral place.
Only comparatively smaller details will be comparatively smaller details: so the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will be the host right in the following round.
To reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements in training plans etc. will be relieved and the players will need to complete less unofficial media schedules prior to the Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US travellers Expected items into the plane, finding a survey
An inquiry under air passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent consciously or unconsciously forbidden objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration repented, including at least 6 per cent, who guess the plane while they accidentally forbidden knife or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had already discovered that it was wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey conducted by more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet-charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather despise the rules.
Of the respondents agreed that they have tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials were compared with less than 15 percent, which were members of the Generation X.
The most common items that have been deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent said to have beneficially carried out objects by security check, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were also confirmed that they were deliberately banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it has asked travellers in all the country to figure out how many accidentally smuggled sware by the airport security and how many things had been deliberately done.
It is no surprise that people who wear most smuggelware - knowingly or unwittingly - by security, those were the most frequently flying.
However, the company refers to that the TSA guidelines are a little complicated and confusing.
People often are uncertain which liquids can carry them away, or how much of it.
So no surprise there is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the TSA confiscated items are forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA could view books as smugadware.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is no matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customer cancers order
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk are pleased with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
So far, he has underestimated that part of the client has withdrawn their unbinding reservations again.
In addition to the always-triumphant numbers, Tesla's boss Elon Musk showed another, less glamorous figure for the first time, that the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 for the first time.
Musk was often advertised with more than 500.000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months.
Now Musk is a: of the 518,000 pre-orders were withdrawn from 63,000 years.
Critics have always pointed out, that it is only a non-committal reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1,000 and in Britain 1000 pounds) "form of reservation" is completely back.
There are currently 45,000 of such non-committal reservations made in a telephone conference with analysts at that time.
If the cancellation of so far, around twelve percent of all orders could be encountered, the Tesla boss believes not.
His argument: the challenge to the ambitious growth target is not in demand, but on the production site.
Last year Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it is supposed to be combined all models - 500,000 to be a million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you can order a "Model 3" at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never in practice tested production lines without larger breaks with maximum occupancy.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if it comes to greater delays, then the disclosure of the reservations might be a problem for Tesla.
For then, the company can't hinder customers, not hinder in droves.
EPA Group CEO Pruitt withdraws for execution of the Obama-Era rules for reducing emissions
A day after he had been complained of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took its former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of state government agencies compared to transition faster than previous administration.
He did not mention the complaint against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeals.
It comes to a time period, which went off on 1 October for States to hold the standards from 2015 to bottomless ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year to study more time to study the plan, and to avoid dealing with local decisions in local decisions or economic growth. "
Pruitt, who was in Oklahoma, before his appointment by President Donald Trump, who had been a great time for a dependable adversary for environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been redesigned to block regulators or delaying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden change from Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruge regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce methane lecks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turn-turn at ozone standards simply put the readiness of EPA for cooperation with the states due to the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.
"under earlier administration, the EPA often has not kept the deadlines for carrying out and then waited, and waited in an agreement for the implementation," said Pruitt, who appealed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"we do not believe in Regulation by judicial procedures, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that gives us seriously. "
"" "nevertheless the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt eventually will use his" "" "power to delay and all other legally available completes" "" "to ensure that the regulations" "" "on a solid politics and the best available information is based." "" "" ""
The Republicans in Congress insists to a broader implementation of the ozone rules.
"" "" "" "one last month approval draft law will delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years." ""
The measure was not yet placed in the Senate.
The New York-General Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of the States, announced the EPA in this week, said the Group intend to maintain the statutory pressure.
"" "" "" "the return of EPA - after our lawsuits - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities." ""
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Penny, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil deozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere on sunlight.
The detestable smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups, and cause thousands of premature fatalities each year.
Representatives of public health and environment proclaims about Pruly surprising course of course.
"" "" "" "it is worrying, how much pressure does it need to get this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe" "", "said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity." ""
"" "" "" "we must fight against the ideological cloister of the Trump Government, to join the pollution and its special interests." "" "" ""
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius-Church
750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Church of the Church, on Sunday 16th July, at 16.30 o'clock, a Serenade is invited to a Serenade.
Whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius site a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the resort have made friends and conveyors of tumors to their concerns.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique petty petod."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer. "count Hermann von Sulz sold" the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen with the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and on his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the certificate according to the certificate, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the lonely parish church, a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church or patron of the church, was not vice versa.
People also lived there.
As described in the description of the Upper Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the underground village and the Oberdorf, which is now still visible in the village of Tumors, is the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlements of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 walls of this historical circumstances.
The Patronatsright arose from the early medieval yolfactory law.
A Lord who built a church, stayed in and occupied with a parish, remained the owner of this church and could also forgive them.
Thus, the right to use a parish priest, or the Bishop a new parish priest.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two ends on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell was then found in 1692, but later in the Second World War had to be released in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windowsies were stolen and the bells were stolen.
The roof was undense.
In 1796, French troops pitched near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariusean church has broken off.
Only the cherries can be stopped.
In 1834, a storm split the steeple storm and the half collapsed.
To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower still existing Turmzwerg remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem works from the "creative professionals" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organizer, the friends and promoter tumours on Sunday, July 16, at the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery for the St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The village officer Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 a.m.
Admission is from 15.30 a.m.
To appeal the Serenade takes place a trunk before the cemetery.
"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers provide a fantastic view." ""
The Serenade takes place only with dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters of the historical St. Hilaire plant, which is important for Tumour and auditors.
The friends and promoter tumours feel particularly committed to the home care how Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirmed.
Association wants to check approval of wind turbines
"" "" "" "Boisheim do not honor" "" "does not see the legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Council." ""
"" "the" "" "Boisheim" "" "is worshipped," "" "the Council of Andreas Coenen (CDU) is prompted to take permission to build the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette." ""
It is unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could not have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only exists at the border border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible, but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are supposed to prevent a "savings" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a few days before due to a change of flood control zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the District government in Düsseldorf hasn't approved, because of a formula.
"" "" "" "due to the missing regulatory requirement is the granted authorization to be unlawful and therefore also back," "" "said Christopher Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""
Current state of things: the Stadthalle once again decided the windconcentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; an authorization of the District government is still standing.
Erkens: "this is the issuance of authorization of a approval for the creation of wind energy investments."
The circle confirms receipt of the entry.
"" "" "" "the corresponding letter has been received since last week in the district of Viersen," "" "said a speaker." ""
The circle takes it to the occasion to reprove the matter.
But they are likely to do, however, that the procedure will be stopped.
With a view on ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district was not aimed at the reasoning of the association "Boisheim" itself.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four kilometres of wind turbines at a surface area of the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, involved in which the city of Viersen is centralised, were closed to the owners of approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be met - this corresponds to approximately one-fifth of all four-four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.
In the last summer, Fortress City Council issued green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich in Aachen and a part in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg, with Heinsberg.

City and retailer plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalaer and people from the region will discover shopping in the city center in September.
The commercial club and city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8-9 September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping spree in the city center.

Urban administration and commercial club cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
So the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown."
These include new offers as the first "active day" for Brunnenfest and selling Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
The attractive offers for Saturday and the reference to the parking fees this day are part of the concept.
Customers will also be reopened to customer potential or again.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost the city downtown shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to contribute to bellow the city center - to landlords, the factories throughout the city and associations.
It was done to overcome the lethargy on a network that partly spread in the spring.
S & D MEP Birgit Streich, Head of the IHK Centers in Mühlhausen, said that the nationwide third "home-shoppen" day, five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
"" "the day should be paid for the appreciation of the local trade and its significance for the commonest of our cities." "" "" ""
The action under spring leadership of the IHK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment itself.

Moores Ford massacre: activists lead racist Lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948-spec Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia and shrinks to the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mobs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train at its cigar, looking through the windshield.
Inside swish the occupants in fear.
"we want this n ---- r Roger!" roared the man.
"get it out of the car!"
Screams the silence, when a young black man was distorted from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this awful scene, which was played on 22nd July, is only one reproduction.
But if a loop is thrown around the neck of "Roger" almost all in the audience there were very real sighs.
Since 2005, Citizers come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were replaced by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody ever was charged because of the murders.
"" "" "" "it's really inconceivable, that in all these years no one person was arrested, although we know who they are," "" "said Tyrone Brooks who helps with the organization of reproduction." ""
"it's a dirt spot on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congress of Congress of Georgia and a Life of Citizens.
For him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected.
"we want prosecution, we want to end, we want cure, we want reconciliation, but first we have to receive justice," he said.
"" "" "" "we can't get to heal and reconciliation until we receive justice." "" "" ""
A beggar gave a towel about the body of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Lynn on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI agents registered by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding Counties were suspected of the LynchProcess.
But none were ever charged.
Although the suspects has been on open-foot for decades, Citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court rendered a decision by the Supreme Court of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their voice in the summer.
About the same time as the election stach according to the FBI of the black Farmpter Roger Malcom a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman.
Brooks said that rumour was in the city that Hester slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy, and that the baby she had, not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white farm owner, 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, thus the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when she went away from prison and the Moore's Ford Bridge approached, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"as it turns out, it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the murders," includes an FBI report.
"" "" "" "it is obvious that there was a plot between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not just involved in the killings, prolonged evidence and the identity of witnesses." "" "" ""
Brooks was formable to formulate it still.
"it was an electoral law," he said.
"" "" "" "they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" "" "if you register, and if you vote, then you will happen here." "" "" ""
Cassandra Greene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde for almost a decade.
Their depiction is illustrative, dramatic and is justified in a kind of profound racism, which many believed that he does not exist in America anymore.
It's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look, but Greene said that this is the point.
"" "" "" "we don't want to talk about Lynchen, because we will be confronted with his hemility in us," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "but I cannot convert any relationship to you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to listen to what I have done." "" "" ""
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest Black - into a room and listening to a well-played overview of the piece started.
Wade Marbaugh is a co-director here.
He played the role of the boss Clanco for years, but he said, the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I am not so", "said Marbaugh.
"" "" "" "but I think it's very important to get this story about life, because we don't want to return to those times." "" "" ""
On the other side of the room the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester play their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, the Hester screams and ousted, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"" "" "" "I said," "" "I --- he wanders from my property!" "" "" ""
Rascona takes the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone breaks (at least of all black actors) into laughter.
Greene laughs at the louder.
"what?!," Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"no," he said Greene, still sizzling.
"I just don't think white people back then 'n ---' he 'said.
"yes," funny one of the other black actors.
"you only need to hit the hard 'R'.
And precisely there is the energy in space, a feeling of cinematship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy doing this properly, not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene will start again.
This time Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and with reprint.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends nonviolent and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a sackcloth, stands on the corpses of the actors and leads budget Holidays "Strange Fruit."
Their voice breaks out in every second word.
About a hundred metres behind it, a group of approximately four dozen people caught sweat, and tears off their eyes.
The audience is divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, traveled to see the performance, many come down only the road.
They have experienced hygias-pressing humidity for nearly eight hours, if Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the gravestone of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the Morde have remained an anecdote, but now when you place on the same country, where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels recompensated.
If the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the dead bodies.
Children sit in their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whispering each other.
"" "" "" "they are not really dead," "" "said a little boy, as if he wants to remember." ""
After a couple of minutes Greene the quantity - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynx wedge and wrenched their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in suit that the Clant played.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammers and breaks down in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him.
"" "" "" "it is okay," "" "whispers one of the women." ""
"we know that this is not in your heart.
"" "you have done this for a reason." "" "" ""
Later the audience joins the actors for dinner together.
A white couple from Atlanta radiates a table with a black pair, which they just met with a black pair.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words, which feeling the performance left.
"" "" "" "it's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... of people who look like you, and those that do what they look like," "" "she said." ""
"" "" "" "what is really doing with me is that Lynchen is still going on," "" "she added," "" "today it is called the Police shooting game." "" "" ""
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks farm holds his table, he is eating and reminiscent of the civil rights.
He said he began to plan the performance in the next year.
"the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"" "" "" "it is so if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again." ""
Whoever does not study his own story, he who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat them. "
"Götterdusk" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental works, director Frank Castorf has relied on a colourful-frivole staging of gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The rotation stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with a wall and a Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes vintage car, in which the Rhine funnel is posing as rock ergents, or as an alternative, Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorfs ladders - money, power and greed - that attracts attention by his "ring" production.
The three Rheingold ders - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold" wonderful.
She seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood Manier a body in the trunk and give the Tie-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderful giant Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxers.
Brutal the scene when he suggests Siegfried.
Later you need to believe in Gunther (Markus oak).
The audience expresses its ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy, Foster, Milling, Vinke and Conductor Janowski, who was modest and hands to the Merkel-smokers' hands formal.
There is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat back in lever leisure wear.
The performance by Frank Castorf and his Regieteam was expected with tension.
"" "in 2013 he had to be another great scoring concert in 2013, five years later, there were five years later, in which the" "" "Buh" "" "was signed." ""
Festspielhaus Katharina Wagner should be pleased about this.
"" "" "" "you notice that the audience has grown together with the" "" "Ring" "" "in a certain way," "" "she had said before the performance of the dpa." ""
The audience did not only have a form of peace with Castorf but it was also an understanding of its view.
I draw a positive resume.
Max amount works as a volunteer
They work in their volunteering year at several places.
Where anywhere?
Quantity: usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help here in Greven, the furniture bridge.
And I have also worked in the open all day at school.
What are your experiences yet?
Quantity: it's a nice, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with youths, refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so late-employed volunteer.
How does this come from?
Quantity: I made high school.
And then a construction engineer, let's say successful.
I recognized it for me, that it is something wrong and I want to do something else with people.
And then I asked what do you do.
Make a social year, there is a glimpse there, as it can see, as it is on site, in the burning point maybe, really.
And was it like that?

For me this was exactly the right thing that provokes me.
I could see and see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.
Differently than in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: well clearly, here is not to calculate statiken.
One always has other people in front of them, each of which have another story behind him.

And they did not have a touch of contact?
Quantity: I'm not the guy.
It is a field that gives a lot.
Plenty of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's life just like that.

EPA returns to the delay of tug rule to clagen
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to condemn the government's government regulation, repeating what the states are obliged to ban the Smog-causing emissions. this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the pacemaker.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive so-called "ozone regulations" in 2015, and said they show the commitment to the agency to cooperate with states.
"" "" "" "we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partners," "" "said EPA boss Scott Pruitt in a statement." ""

Municipal law wants a common room
At the end, the decision was clear: in two respects, the municipal at Fluid Winked decides to set up a common room in the future senior facility.
Prior to the discussion there is an important information: the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece may be signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjades reports.
Although it is still ongoing, until the date of the church assembly is owned by the community, there is now no planning relief for that of a private investor to the project more.
There is a discussion concerning a common room.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat, offered to meet the church.

The decision was to indicate that in this regard, no Knüppel will throw away from the legs in this regard, that both saddle - what is leaning on the surrounding grounds - as well as Pultdach - which reduces the tear-height and the construction more economical - that would be possible.
Needless, not only Wilfried sole, be this addition.
If it helps: unanimously he passes the body.
It is not so easy in the common room.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings, with which one is not so wrong with them, and you can now rest in the common room of the window, says: "I'm so hard to do with it."
Yvonne Stader speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to the property's property or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface one should not give a supplement, but can get a true, in doubt, is the equivalent of the return.
Staigers proposal to plead the decision in accordance with the decision, finds three proponents.

Hiking in the Harz star
In Harz, the nationwide first "star path" should be created.
This is the name of the Club Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary way in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "starpath" come to meet the information needs of many hares, whose name was.
He Connects Nature, Science, Movement and Sporty Performance.
The members want to set up the route along the planned route and inform about stars and starters.
In a first phase to 2018 the association is planning "well available installations in five to six places" in the upper-harz.
Inquery to St. Andreasberg, Brauner, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
Information on the tablets are expected to be complemented by the Internet.
This is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the starpath should be extended by train.
"" "" "" "the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," "" "said the association." ""
In addition, they learned why stars would have different colors, or why a star is stronger than another, although it is much further away.
Also, in which constellation can be viewed a selected star and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andreasberg in 2014, the highest star-observatory in northern Germany since 2014.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is home to the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there come from the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye clearly visible.
In the university town there have been something similar to the Planetarium Foundation since 2003, something similar to the planned cluster - the planet route.
Starting from Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path leads up to Hainberg and observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stalls with the individual planets - including the dwarf planed Pluto at the end point - are exactly in the distance and a standard of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks thus on a sphere of 6.5 mm diameter, while the sun measures approximately 70 centimeters at the temperature.
The whole distance of the planet is just four kilometers.
While the light is needed in the sun up to the Pluto for about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the bar with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixation but would take a half year.

Fortunas Hoffmann: "rotating chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2: 2 season opener against Braunschweig, making the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue points.
With the first seasonal game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, as did not the two opponent at 2: 2 to Braunschweig.
"" "" "" "these were two opposites too much, and we have to fit even better in Aue," "" "says the defensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf." ""
The threshing chain should also be further optimized in the Erzgebirge.
And a gate after a crash, the Fortunas are no longer able to increase.
"" "" "" "for the future it will be so that no one turns into line with Michael (Rensing)." "" "" ""
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also gets better to experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the quette.
"I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is one of his cause, "because we are just able to build the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," said Hoffmann.
"" "" "" "it is a requirement for us to harmonize things even better and we do not afford such a lot of mistakes." "" "" ""
Of course, Hoffmann appears to Aue to win the game.
"" "" "" "whether you cannot speak after a misslated start, don't know." ""
The performance could certainly be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"" "" "" "if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will surely be able to talk about a regular season opener." "" "" ""
Of that, his coach would know nothing.
"" "" "" "the start to the season I took only after six to eight playing days," "" "said Friedhelm Funkel, who would not speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony had to be broken off in Heidenheim because of an accident." ""
"now they can begin the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that players from Aue might be even more fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna for an ascension favorite in the bones.
"" "" "" "but they don't know that 100 per cent where they currently stand," "" "says the inside of the Fortuna." ""
The guests out of the Rhineland as a slight favorite on Sunday at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"that we run them away, just because we are entitled to come under the first six, is stupidity," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"" "" "" "there are no crew in the 2nd division, which one must hit from the outset," "" "Fortunas Chef coach." ""
"" "" "" "such a statement would be arrogant and arrogance." "" "" ""
And so Funkel wants to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
The recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that over 80 per cent of the tested people are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Institute of Forensic Medicine (Regulations) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year.
During the asylum process, you should take more precise during the asylum process, after the Swedish migration authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for lack of the correct age of some refugees that were the age of age.
Until today, Migrationsverket has nozzles 6.880 and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency told that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 instances, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly less than 18 years old."
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constantly constant.
"" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly consistent," "" "he said the magazine" "" "The Local." ""
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the subject was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet comments the 581 published results, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, at x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee-joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska-Institute, whose work comprises the assessing the biological maturity of human beings to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed by puberty.
"" "" "" "I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." ""
To judge the biological age in this way, is very uncertain.
"" "if we can't be sure we should not do so as if we could," "" "he said the newspaper Metro." ""
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of developing a child as an adult is poor.
"" "" "" "the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18, this is about 10 percent." "" "" ""
Fully in plan
The work on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are doing well.
On Wednesday a seven tons of concrete concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lauterbach.
"" "" "" "we are very well in the time, it's super," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Road and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""

And then the pedestrian walkway shall fail.
The special thing is that there are components, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.

In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for them that the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Stork keep their speeches.

COE praises "honest" Russian apologies for doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday that he described as an obvious excuse of Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated, it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in sports.

Around 1000 people of the two women who were stared by a stroke helicopter in Mali with a funeral in the North hessischer Fritzlar.

Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), wants to be buried in his death after his death.
This divided the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for both of them.
The Queen didn't agree with the decision of her husband, so it was in the message.
Where Prince Henrik was buried, is still unclear.
But he is not the intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a Hehl that he was not happy with his title.
He would have become king to reign after the ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972.
In 2016 he retired and puts the title "Accept."
Since Henrik did not see the title and function that he wanted to see himself as opposed to his wife - also not after the death, Lene Balleby, the chief president of the Danish king house.
"" "" "" "where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be unclear." ""
But he is not the intention of being buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocracy, had met Margrethe 1965 in London.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
In his later wife the sympathies of the people always implied, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year old regression with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik was about the first years in Denmark: "a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis courts instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, and the call had given the call to be the brand-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for a view.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was just two mistakes! "

CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
However, the prime minister of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of red-green governance for a rapid re-election of the country, but he does not want to return.

Previously, the startling of a Green Party members from their country fraction in Lower Saxony, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) was overthrown into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official appointment of the regional election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-votes majority in Parliament to the Opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green-Euro MP Elke Tire justifies her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"" "" "" "I see my political future in the CDU," "" "said on Friday in Hannover." ""
S & D Group president Björn Thesis will encourage his group to record them.
Thus, CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the lower-Saxon country, SPD and Green 68 seats.
To date, the ratio was vice versa.
The new Parliament will be elected regular on January 14.
Thronler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to rule out in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, keeps it indispensable for the fact that the farm decides to decide its self-resolution.
The CDU faction is expected to decide on its Tuesday on Tuesday.
The state constitution also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, draws the trust and chooses a successor.
"our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities should be examined legally, "said Thronler.
"" "" "" "we ask all the questions, if they are legally aware of them." "" "" ""
Thronler named Twestens step "but something strange."
The politicians even stressed: "I am not a representative.
I feel very good. "
She described himself as a trailer of black-green.
The Green Party called on the backslid MPs to return their land daily.
"" "" "" "we are of course, of course, that they have received their country list, which has given them over the green state list, with immediate effect," "" "divided the national leaders meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner." ""
The Group's leader of the Green Anja PIEL said: "we regret the decision of Elke Tire extraordinarily."
They deliberately decided to lead any pronunciation in the faction.
"" "" "" "also in front of the background, there was no lasting differences, we cannot do this step." "" "" ""
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the State of the State Green MEPs Elke Tire to the CDU as a betrayal.
"" "" "" "the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only the betrayal of voters and voters, but also betrayal in red-green," "" "wrote the Bundeschef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook." ""
He will support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly choose the country's day.
The outlet Twestens costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.

Resignation of CDU Parliamentary Group Björn Thought wants to recommend his MPs to record Elke Tire to the CDU.
The German leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, threw the lifejackets, with a personal career giving up the result of the 2013 regional election.

Agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect us from toxins, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses over contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Home Affairs Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) works in an interview with the German editorial network Germany (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, How does the consumer protect from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage consumers who want to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure.
On the Consumer Protection portal www.grocery warnung.de make the federal states the latest information on the affected eggs batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all, what we know currently, is practically excluded from health hazards.
Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the purpose of the federal states.
"" "" "" "nevertheless, my house is immediately ascending and has since become acquainted with the affected area in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries." ""
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
Trading has the same way to worry about that the sold products are transport and health unthinkable.
If in eggs of the residual level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded, these are not traffic.
Unloaded eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.
This time not the farms to blame.
Are production plants and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production plants hits no immediate guilt.
Rather, they have to pay due to potentially illegal practices of services with economic damages.
As always there is too little checking in the harvest.
Is it only missing on the staff or even at the conclusive jurisdiction?
There were just the official controls which have revealed the process.
However, the truth also belongs to that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
For this reason, a consistent advent of such events and the handover to the government bar in the cases, in which offences may be present, of crucial importance.
I have already made several times that I expect from the responsible authorities an error-free statement.
Is the regular alarm system necessary for food scales?
Consumer consumers have the right to get safe and secure food.
If a non-approved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers and consumers are not outraged.
Producers, traders and consumers are advised in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Generally, it must be clear: the unlawful use of insecticide Fibrail in the attitude of life-breeding animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately.
It must be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact will be swiftly and distressed.
How the financial rules of football on Neymars move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing monstroked issues of European football matches will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will be made for Paris Saint-Germain on the UEFA, as the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to negotiate teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair Play rules, which were called by the UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG had to point out sometime that the transfer of Neymar was financed without a major loss.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian ans from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.
PSG can handle the money with safety, so Neymar supposes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich mastery family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to purchase a lot of money for acquiring players, but must act with legitimate income, which allow them to break the break-even point in her on the football-related business.
From Michel Platini, he was designed for the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that one who had received enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively fraudulent and risked to ruze, if banks or owners have returned their support.
In 2011, FFP surrendered to the concentration of the clubs on the surveillance of their losses.
The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in the Chelsea in 2003, and then invested a club with potential, and then invested heavily in order to build the team and build a global brand.
While the current three-year-old FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of up to 30 million euros.
And even though Platini has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to make it a bit of excessive expenditures.
"surely, FFP is not dead, and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso who is responsible for the UEFA Cup in the previous week, compared to The Associated Press.
Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for billing on the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, allowing for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG together with Abu Dhabi, is located in the possession of Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (82 million dollars), which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members of the 2014-15 European Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to exceed their financial supervision by providing their income by companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could transponders the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA Cup would not apply as legitimate income.
Exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the Pact of PSA of the Qatar Tourism Authority is puffed up.
It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments from the 2022 World Cup committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar have fought that Neymar WM ambassadors will be simply to be able to find out a such manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA is still more attentive, trying to observe the rules.
The UEFA has no pre-preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated sales of €542.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year have to be published.
PSG expects that Neymars arrive a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, Merchandising and Trikotadsales.
The Association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football player, and she tried to prevent Neymars. by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"it is a clear case of" financially doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katars the official owner of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by American sports tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed a club.
"" "" "" "it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "Wenger said on Thursday." ""
"once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because you have different ways or have different interests, if a country has such a great actor to represent a country. "

Industry insider estimate the order volume according to "Northwestschweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs.

Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 years, for the 90-year period (the State "for MTV rotten), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger matters.
As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"first Day of Camp" surprisingly good, not just because of its absurd lobster (it contained a original story for an attractive box vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By touching the core of the Gags - actors in middle ages play gropes children who grow up - nonetheless, they create the possibility to gain the last part of the weather.
"ten Years Later," with its adults, who now play adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody goes out after the cast principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90-th anniversary like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand which crackles the cradle").
On a point, a character is split by an Apple Powerbook, some inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Show old), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost its virginity yet.
And there is still another crazy-evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the exit rates are the best part of the franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dalistache of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on Camp Andy feels like an old boy.
It's the moments of accidental madness that could bring this franchise as a sort of repeated "Seven Years!" until he reaches what I see as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene is showing the gang of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"" "" "" "comrade Detective" "" "on Amazon now remembers another kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of" "" "The Americans" "", "on the film" "" "Atomic Blonde" "" "and even at" "" "Glow" "" "with its east-west ring road iconography." ""
The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director to be a greased TV series: an Romanian drama of the eighties, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main cast - a hart Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized English.
It's a genius idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police forgets the time to watch chess in television as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous spokesman - Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Finde the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer that carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays as one.
At six long episodes, it turns away, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.
"" "" "" "comrade Detective," "" "that was redigged on a lesser length, because Gregor and Iosef will always return to the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a heap of hamburgers." ""
The message for the imagined communist audience is that western culture can make everything for the age.
The fictive Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with her own younger ones.
Impact against drug mafia in the country
The police has a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in the Schwarzwald-Baar County, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched for, as the public prosecutor's office took place on Friday.
At the age of 25, 15 accusations were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already arrest warrants issued against this.
In addition, the officers produced larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand Euros certainly.
Two people were arrested at the same Razcia in Italy.
On the two suspects Italian, there were German arrest warrants.
The two are probably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 policemen were in use.
The members of the Mafia was accused of drug criminality, severe violence, attempted murder, and robbery.
Already in summer 2016 the public prosecutor's office constance against organised drug dealers in the South German room.
Between the Heads of State in Constance and Palermo, a reactive exchange and investigators of the Crimean Rottweil had virtually daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore the deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
In particular, the examination of the investigations were primarily Italian nationals with respect to the Italian mafia.
A incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired up in the morning in the morning, is likely to go to the gang of bonds.
Manner denounces large gaps in foreigner register
"" "" "" "data from citizens who should not appear" "" ": a report indicates the foreigner registrations in Germany." ""
Lead to partly serious misdecisions at asylum procedures.
"" "the commissioner management of the federal government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has said a media report to great gaps in the country's central register." ""
Shortcomings of the registered data can be found in asylum procedures and deportations "in partly serious misdecisions," in an analysis called the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the registers, according to the register, ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality, some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore administered by some 600 exclusion authorities in Germany.
Because the data have not been adequately maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts so far.
"" "in individual cases, data from 1921 were found," "" "of people who have long been no longer alive, or citizens who are German citizens and should not appear in the register." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "incorrect data input can significantly slow down processes," "" "says the report." ""
"" "" "" "statistics of statistics of travellers" "" "over EU citizens" "" "registers over EU citizens who would not have to travel." ""
However, such misdirectives led "to a distorted debate on dealing with travel agents," says the analysis in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has clearly begun to return refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy, when they arrived from there.
It covers an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabsticker Newspaper."
In the paper, the BAMF welcomes such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017. "
Since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site.
After the Dublin agreement, it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to achieve them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state may send him back to the country.
"" "for the reason the office has now been writing:" "" "now the admission capacity for families with underage children in Italy increased significantly." "" "" ""
Italy have left for the recording and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) put these commitments for sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement.
The internal policy spokeswoman in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "families with children are threatening because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a companion of childhood."
Second best result achieved
There are a total of 220 liters of blood of the people living in Oberreichenbach are already available for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday.
Together with his 100 donations, Jürgen Greule, who has now distributed 50 litres of blood in the meantime.
Traditionally, the church was buried in the meeting of the Municipal Council which donates multiple readiness to donate blood.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have caused speculation over a rise.
"" "the Bank of England warned that economic growth" "" "will remain, while interest rates on family income lies in the middle of a intensifying print." ""
The policy-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for providing interest rates to 0.25%, with less members this month, as the weak economic growth has the support for an increase.
In its quarterly annual sales report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue, whereas inflation in the fall is likely to rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But it claims that in the coming years, interest rate would be necessary to brewing those of the Brexit, and they said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected to finance the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw a part of Mammut's economy, which was issued a year after the Brexit.
It will challenge time for the financial plan to provide cheap financial resources for banks even though it was predicted that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.
"" "minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said:" "" "in the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak, as the pressure on the reside of households continues to consume consumption." "" "" ""
At interest rates, it repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy is needed for the cooling of inflation and a" slightly larger "extent, than the markets expect.
Markets also forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
The Bank has however stressed that increases "gradually" and "limited" would be made.
The Bank forecast downwards growth forecast for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
It maintained its growth forecast for 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to no change occurred, after the recent disappointing growth numbers have fought rising expectations for interest rate and increase GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to recover at 0.3% in the third quarter although it will be easily recovering after the Bank at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor salaries, as the tighten is getting worse before they become better.
"" "she added that monetary policy will not" "" "prevent your income before the next few years," "" "but she added that wages can recover" "" "at the end of their three-year reaction." ""
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to weak Pounds which is a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
A year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pelvic.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment, the reputation had increased after an interest rate, since inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision makers in July increased an increase to 0.5%.
Inflation has fallen down to 2.6% in June last month, although the Bank has said that this was expected to come again in the coming months.
The Bank said that in relation to their goal of 2% be "entirely" to weak pounds.
Andrew Montt, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the recent decision of the swap rate the mortgage market should be more competitive again, as the lenders are looking forward to shops and want to end in a positive way.
The market is especially good for those who run the existing Deals and exclude the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (National Health Service) shall drive the controversial of HIV-drug 10,000 people
"" "patients will receive access to a" "" "transforming" HIV preventional treatment "" "" from September after a battle against financing the drug in the NHS. "" "
NHS England announced that one of the risk of infection with high risk reduction in high risk patients can decrease around 86 percent prior to sexual intercourse, now from health service to a first three-year study of estimated 10,000 people.
He declared to finance the trial, after the Court of Appeal confirmed the Supreme Court in the last year, confirming the NHS, despite the assertion that local authorities should finance him.
The Chess Federation announced on Thursday announced by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention" while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first who will enable the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018.
Prepositionist trophylaxes (PrEP) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that prEP has significantly reduced the HIV transmission to Infection.
PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications in the body are present to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken any day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
To those who come to the treatment, gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV-positive partners who were not successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified to study the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to have antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and registered with a domestic doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by using clinical evidence, as it is used in large scale targeted and implemented.
Stevens said: "this great new intervention should be the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to complement and overtake HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in preserving one of humanity's largest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted specifically for needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV-risk access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner to improve many of many lives.
We welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority has to be done so that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV.
"" "now that the PrEP test medicine was designed, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people." "" "" ""
Sharon Hodgson, shadow Health Minister, said: "the beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitating implementation.
The evidence show how transformed this drug may be part of our approach to HIV-prevention and end the transfer of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people that are HIV-infected, and that we contribute to contribute that we will come closer to the dissemination of HIV in society. "
Life Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their pockets and sold their bags.
"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something similar to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
"" "I have made me in love with her and made an offer to this day." "" "" ""
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room manor with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yoghurt storage space and a mezzanine to optimise the generous appearance height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she instructed the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home not just a development but also a place to life for Joanne.
The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which one could stand.
Erfan was needed to be creative in order to solve the award.
"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overstacked, without letting us gaps." ""
It was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height above or below the right height. "
This arrangement enabled Erfan, to place two rooms at full height - with much an additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper window of retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.
The embossed gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirror plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a small corridor mirrored to leave him longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the taxing and glasses of Joanne.
By perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"a bit of engineer went inside," explains Erfan from steel-reinforced, furnified MDF-door.
"" "" "" "it's opposite, so that when you push the door, very easily glides." "" "" ""
Thanks to the cleverable use of space and storage space Joanne could win an extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," Erfan says.
"a real estate agents will enter a real estate agents and perform a calculation based on soil size."
Here they managed to enlarge the floor space, and at the same time, to use high-quality materials that provides space to the space.
"" "" "" "the materials are things which you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home" "", "Erfan says." ""
"" "" "" "you don't love yourself in electrical outlets in walls." ""
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can be turned through a good design and increased square size of something standard in something very astonishing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave this one.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family since 2014, but a sharp discussion on the separation is held in the Supreme Court.
Along with her mother Anna, the brothers 38 real estate has accumulated a value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.
The family Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis includes offices in town-rum, the area areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul referred to as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the family of De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul is about one-third.
A judicial field indicates that Colin owned its property worth $316 million and Paul in value of 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"" "" "" "the proposed divisions have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in an first affidavit." ""
Last Friday, after several failed attempts, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Brothers now also fight to control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims to have cast it out.
Colin argued that this is not true, but throws Paul before, administer some owners incompetent.
In an early affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says, he hope to join the dispute.
"" "" "" "my Italian heritage writing that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""
The costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails, and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her husband Luigi Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacessences from the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used safety to buy the Collingwood property, in Colin opened the first jeansing family.
Colin says he began to see Westco, when he was "in my last years of high school, Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their children.
"" "" "" "Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land" "" "brothers" "", "she wrote." ""
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company Group, whereby Colin claims that Mark had paid $10 million while leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "says Paul" about the conditions of their financial separation. "
Colin made himself very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media took care of Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I can really not say much," "" "because the case is before the courts." ""
"" "" "" "it's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and to complain about our family names," "" "he wrote." ""
In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.
"" "" "" "our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute," "" "he said, and added that he was still looking forward to a solution." "" "" ""
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"" "" "" "our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts," "" "wrote Colin." ""
Trumps has plans to limit new Chief of Staff to limit the Presidency of the President.
Others have tried and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, at his first working day with senior employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that have entered the president's hands.
Kelly said that information about him should flow through - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would take better decisions when he would get good information. "
Kellys Diagnosis makes sense but others have attempted to tame Trump, by monitoring its medical device.
President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now where he is at the White House, his TV advertisement is still strong.
"when the candidate was offended, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince him," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February versus POLITICO.
Policos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit is taking control, according to six former campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a priceless praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever 'was under control, is ridiculous.
Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets have no more spark plug without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't broadcast.
If his staff had made it a few times, trouble away from it, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Materials, which may promote their views from the world.
POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported on the preference of advising the preference for the preference for strategic reasons.
This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"current and former Trump officials said that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press prints, especially those with shameful lung cheques, and that it turns out to figure out where these come from.
Just that happened at the end of February, when someone sent a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of being" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been banned from Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence or that he expressed incorrect preaches in the past and revoke it.
Trump read the article and began to ask staff over Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the trump."
How did that work?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive to influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Meistablished criminals get mail from Europol
As the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
The police in all Europe sends back to dangerous criminals in this summer (virtual) postcards.
As the addresses of selected heavy criminals are not known, indications from the population will be hoping and to pray.

Travellers take action on a ditch and return back to 'Millionaire series'
Some of the wealthiest owners of West Midlands are back with some tough travellers on the foot of war, who have traded one from the church drawn grabs to withstand a field in front of their men's houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, which is called "millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies, and a army of transports, after they were cast out in May, but had been deported from the grave, but had been deported from the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Raging inhabitants have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous inhabitants said, "They are moved on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley Heath, where they were thrown onto the passers.
The Council must be forced through shame to implement in fact, as he was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travellers in May there were further moved and are now back again.
More came yesterday evening, and probably more. "
She added: "the Council of Birmingham knows how to circumvent how you keep long breaks to protect their parks.
I'm not happy at the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to keep my shared share when the Council can't stop it once. "
A resident who could not be called, said: "it is ridiculous, we just have seen the last round of those travelers to be looted only by another round.
The figures have increased this time and we even saw a horse in the parking area. "
A spokeswoman of Solihull said: "we are aware of an unscrew camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road, and work with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps to make it fast as possible.
To support our support collection, it is very important that as many people have reported a anti-social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we propose our case. "
From Birkenhof at Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is located.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with closure of the hotel Birkenhof through the then ambience of the hotel Birkenhof during the 13th of April 2014, some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also paid revenues by the local tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, given a dramatic increase in figures of refugees that came to the county, the hotel's office building offered as a collective accommodation offered for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by placing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not controversial at that time.
But above all Freudenstadts Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defending the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interested parties at the house.
He should keep right.
The group Luisenhotels with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will return it to a house of three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The Group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenchib.
You will be called Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise, and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former hotel Birkenhof there have been a container container in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made.
Floors were demolished, blankets are partly dismantled, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building site.
There is much to be done until March.
"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest.
The rooms are equipped with large furnished showers, the input area is designed, new windows are installed.
Everything should become "beautiful bourgeois close" as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"we want to make a jewel."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
It is not to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbath, but already on a higher city center level, highlights Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, looks broad, explains Scherer further.
Both single holidaymakers, groups or businessmen are to feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause he already led to the Scherer.
The performances of the city be covered with the hotel group.
"we are on the same line."
According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.
Just under a million Euro, he reckons.
The external services are also brought to front of front, this is clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace which is open from the restaurant that is open to public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia Affair: U.S. special agent sets a Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is alleged to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.
The panel has taken up work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under vocation of the people familiar.
The newspaper recorded the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there is already the first precharging of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin to have been engaged in the presidential election in 2016.
Mueller examines if there were agreements between Trumps electrophy and Moscow.
The investigations are aimed at investigating several men who acted in the election campaign as advisor of the Republicans.
According to reports, Mueller also adopted more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope.
The Washington Post wrote a couple of weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally got into the centre and check the accusation if the president possibly has hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys, to examine and decide, to examine and decide whether he should be charged.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecutor.
They are mostly switched on, if there are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to turn persons to the interrogation under oath.
According to the broadcaster, CNN were already shown to meet the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons who were involved in the meeting were prompted by a statement, named it in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps consultants and law-law Jared Kushner and his damaging campaign manager Paul Manafort were involved in conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the insertion show that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he should be needed to act quickly.
However, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end in order to decide about the arrest of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the enforcement of the Gremium of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president took an address in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""
The subject give the Democrats a way to feel "good, because they have nothing else to talk about that."
His special advisors Ty Cobb declared in an opinion that he does not know anything about the creation of a Grand Jury.
This, however, usually work in the obedience, he emphasised.
"" "the White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent" "" "faire" "". "" ""
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times, that not against the President.
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in it, its name was further explained in the declaration.
Mueller was not first used after Trump had fired comey.
Because of this ramp, accusations against Trump had become noisy, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June prior to a Senate committee, Trump asked him to have asked for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under large pressure because of the investigation.
After representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.
This led speculation about whether Trump Mueller would be dismissed.
Unlike an independent special agent of the congress, such as in the Watergate affair with Richard Nixon, Mueller has received a position in which he could be fired at the presidency of the President of Justice of Justice in theory.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators were ordered by the legislative elections on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be released.
Antarctica: gigantic iceberg casts in Antarctica
In the west-Antarctica a gigantic iceberg has replaced the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelleis.
This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The weighing over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 sq km big coloss are now moved to the north and will probably take two or three years until he is melted.
It is equipped with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest iccaries who have registered researchers over the past three decades.
There is no danger for people.
When climate change played a role during the crash of the iron, research is unclear according to research.
However, the US research center for snow and ice cream has been held in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.
According to many researchers, it can be related to global warming.
The coloss was now a part of the Larsen-C-Schelcows.
The bowls swim on the sea and is peaked by large glaciers.
It always grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelcows is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this Schelfeises was the balance of waxes and disruptions several years ago.
AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes in a complete shame, writes AWI.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shrinking is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.
In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and could fall, if at a key point a piece of breaking.
The melting of Schelcows and Eisberg increases the sea level, because they swim in the water and pushes the ice so much water as it gives the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shrine is that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in small measures, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelcows is the fourth largest in the Antarctica for almost 50 000 square kilometres.
The front of the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"" "" "" "although it is a natural creature and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the ice plate is now in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""
"this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed.
Among scientists is controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelcows will come back again, and possibly close together, his colleague Adrian Luckman, added, added: "our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though this researcher will not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not to climate change, so in the past decades, many ice caps of the Antarctic peninsula are torn apart.
This long skirts of Antarctica is located towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and counter to the areas where the temperature is fastest.
CDU wants hoists at the personnel
Because it is increasingly difficult to occupy vacancies, the CDU calls out from the employer association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break the chalk went through 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind him.
The teachers in circles are obviously very desired.
Some 620 applications for this year were to be recorded in this year.
Nevertheless, the circle is still missing, in order to overcome the increasing requirements and tasks.
Currently there are in the circle Mettmann according to the 50-occupied places.
Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought.
The CDU would like to take the initiative in the CDP and the UWG initiative and join the field of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties of the parties, "a concept of recruiting and personnel development is expected to work."
It is, not only short-term demand to cover specialists, but future-oriented application to apply, it is called.
The overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside, demonstrating concrete action for cross-starting instruments and include an educational offensive, challenge CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems, which one would not know earlier.
Other cities recruits good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
"" "speech is from a regular" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""
For this purpose, there is a high number of employees, the disease or age caused by the service.
So the greatest time to act, so that not even more places remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, leader of the CDU, continues with his party yet through the joint application.
He had long ago already in the chalk for a frank surprise when he asked the recruitment of personnel in public and the other parties ocked.
People want to check all possibilities that allow for an exit from the municipal employers association.

Thus, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials to pay better than it actually sees the tariff for public service.
The salaries are currently pre-written, increases or more money, only if one changes in a higher level, which is orientated to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle are growing steadily over the past years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least by the rising number of asylum seekers, Council Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirector Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the sound to NGO's migrant lifejackets
Italy has committed NGOs working for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, warned that they may not continue to continue their new rules for their operations.
"if NGOs do not sign a new code of code, it is difficult to see how they can work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Reset', because their crew collaborated effectively with trafficking in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The relief organisation, which has only been operating since one year, refused to express itself to a comprehensive pronouncement of the Italian citizen Ambrogio Cartosio.
"for us and remains the rescue of human life our top priority. so we are very sorry that we can't operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organisation in an opinion on social media.
"" "" "" "we can only judge all the claims that are currently collected, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""
The Italian authorities have supervised the boat of 'Youth Reset', the Iuventa, and since October.
It is assumed that its crew accumulates on board ships that are delivered directly from human hands, and that the smugglers can drive, so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acquisition of the nationality, whose contents of Italian media was published.
The occupation is suspects, on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.
Under the code of code you need to have boats such as Iuventa, especially an Italian police officers, who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, have previously declared to hold on the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential amendments or disability" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who came after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guard and co-operation with the local civil servants.
"" "" "" "in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali concerning measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.
Anstiege and Trials
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outposts" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region, for four days to enjoy trials and landmarks.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation at the Wachenheimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burgund- and Weinfall from Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.
The first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Michaelepielle above Deidesheim.
It followed Viewpoints, partly on doormen, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the fore-bearing levels.
In between the long time there were longer breaks, for the long trials.
On the second day there went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the People's Festival.
The lookout spot to the lookout spot, connected by "flowige" Trials and moderate Anstiege.
On the last two days, many altimeter were told again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers started in the open-air content of healing Sole.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
What are the sport stars in future in front of computer kones, rather than sweating at wind and weather through the stadium to fight?
Fact: e-sport has long been become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - great stars, millions fans and huge tournaments with high gages inclusive.
This also recognized the first federal government, increasingly to engage in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg later followed the VfB Stuttgart, the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says President Jochen Röttgermann.
"" "he is sure" "" "there are some failure to rise on this train." "" "" ""
"" "on the next weekend the FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first" "" "Interactive Club World Cup" "" "in which the Gamer of various clubs will compete against each other." ""
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.
The Ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has since become an agency for virtual football players.
"" "" "" "the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people still go into the stadium," "" "says the 52 year old." ""
And: the clubs attempted to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian.
With celebrity e-sportsmen under contract, you could be more often present in these markets than once in the year the Bundesligamannum to Asia.
Why is it exactly?
In the e-sport computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA at competitive level.
They have long ago, as in the normal sport, lights established, in which the pros will compete against each other.
And in Asia, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it all about a real sports?
For many is the performance of ordinary needs.
Ingo Frobo has long been dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and many biological and physical responses show, which you can also find in classic sport, for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
Besides, it need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability.
Professional gamers should not only train the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.
"the fitte player is a good player."
But Frobo also sees problems: "doping is getting more a theme."
Controls are hard-screened at online-games, and in the scene failed the structures of classical Sports.
The scientists emphasise the high-inclusive effect of the E-Sports.
The players are international on the road, that's like a great global family, there is no intercultural shirt.
A study by the management consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth ahead of the E-sport.
Thus, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsorship, and big tournaments.
In three years the turnover is expected to lie at 130 million.
The football Bundesliga was almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice-hockey," writing the Deloitte advisor.
International are many countries.
Great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invested in the eSport competition in Unikrn.
There is also a lot in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as lessons, he says Frobber.
In the Netherlands and in France the soccer-first League-associations have been committed to the bris, an e-sport department.
"" "" "" "in the European comparison Germany," "" "VfB-Managing Director Röttgermann explains." ""
But only in nostalgia to fall, and the old times are to clarify, it is no longer enough.
It is therefore to maintain the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time.
"we live in an digitised world," also debris.
"" "" "" "there you can't hold on it, that only when football remains so, as it always was." "" "" ""
Venom-eggs ade - The egg-alternatives to cooking and baking

In the shelves, only eggs are not taken, which are demonstrably no fidelil.
Michelle Carter, because of the lyrics, insisted Conrad Roy to commit suicide,
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she has encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their imprisonment behind bars and spending five years on parole.
Carter was condemned in June for moving murder of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
"" "the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing:" "" "my family is uncomforting." ""
My son was my best friend. "
Carter allowed to stay free until calling.
She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both they had suffered a psychotic disease as well as Mr Roy.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream colourfully, Carter stood with tears in eyes, folded hands and down-facing eyes when she was condemned.
"" "" "" "their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "" "said the lawyer to the judgment." ""
"she finished his life to make their own better.
She has no responsibility, "she said.
"she has no remorse."
But Carters attorney said it was a terrible circumstance, which they utterly regret. "
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, did not find out that their age or Reifegrad was a significant impact on their actions. "
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who said it was "no day, in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me, and as I go with everything. I try, despite all my pain, which we will carry with us for eternity with us, for his sisters to be there.
Roys Sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted by the realization" that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or would be a aunt for his children.
"" "" "" "no more to have this only person I've been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life," "" "she said." ""
The case seems to be a legitimate precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal-oxidant poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case also drew national attention, after Carters pronunciation claims that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"" "" "" "go on, spring from a building, start yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "" "she said in several news that she sent in two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family." ""
"" "in the eyes of his suicide they wrote," "" "You must do it, Conrad" "" "and" "" "Whatever you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy." "" "" ""
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by Roy's death and ordered that they would benefit from any press of the case.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
To the few who have defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 because of murder on their British fellow countrymen in Italy, was acquitted of two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 Years old, published a comment by the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimme: learn from the new Mini-Lame of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimme allowed me to run as captain in the Audi Cup, is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern wins the Confed Cup winner for a great season - extra motivation was not available.
Anything else was there in his place in the cabin, which looked at Joshua Kimme immediately, even if the additional clothes was very small, very small.
But as far and broad on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, there was no Philipp Lending and no Manuel New Year, he made his bark to his arm.
"" "" "" "the coach didn't announced," "" "said the Confed Cup winner after his first deployment to Bavaria-Captain." ""
Well, the one would have better run than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the character of the coach was Kimme.
Not the eight-year older Arturo Vidal was born in the youth game, debutants and especially from the holiday home professionals existing C-elf as a game leader, but he.
Sugar is distributed as a gift to those, to which one will give much to them that you want to keep in a mood.
Who, therefore, became selected to compete for the inheritance of Lame, can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimme confirmed: "this is what one would like to take on responsibility."
On Wednesday the 22-year-old died as mini-lame on the field.
Right behind, this is now its position, the white Bind on the arm did its rest.
And even at all, Kimme worked in this position as the one that can take the rod the best in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troupe.
He had a look for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal wants to override his missing fitness (folks hard); Renato Sanches thus, to get out to the performance of the Asia-trip (folks also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süver joins in their first appearance at the Bavaria-Trikot in their first appearance.
It worked out quite well.
Süver next to Kimme, Rudy before the defense of the army, ran in supremingly confident.
The well-occupied Napoli storm was very difficult, moreover, Süver tried to make a couple of times in the play-building.
His colleague Rudy said that the result "was not the way we hoped it was."
But he also showed a decent achievement in the debut.
Playing time, tempo changes: "I was also picked up for this style."
As unused to Bavaria-Welt in addition to the newcomings, you saw it in connection to the game.
Rudy, for example, was not one or two, but determines six or seven interviews.
Kimme retired after some crisp statement in his back of his new players.
There he heard of Süver a interesting phrase: "what is going on here I have noticed now.
"" "in Bavaria you have to win every game." "" "" ""
After all, he must not teach the new one more.

Company content with Rhineland-pfalz Minister: Economics, Responing Tempo
It often proved inconciliatory, the relationship between the country and regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) still was an economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This shows itself after more than one year in which the new business minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak to T V-inquiry by a change in the economic policy - and add the old minister at the same time.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association Trierer company (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked forever."
Natus's biggest turnaround sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the direction of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is in the priority list of the country now above.
Even this year, the Ministry for a planning procedure, until 2021 is expected to be the construction law.
Trier, too, plays a role in the plans of the country, also in the preobtrusive need of the Federal Constitutional Court.
The aim is to take the route in December 2020, says Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus looks at a sign for regional, but internationally competing companies.
The industrial and industry (IHK) of Trier is as a Rhineland-Palatinate label, at the wine a Rhineland-Palatinate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years.
Moreover, I have an open ear for people who want to establish a own company, praise IHK.
The craft of Trier, in the new Master-Bonus, sees an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
Planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the completed master examination and 2500 Euros, when graduates now made self-employment within ten years.
The homework list for the country remains long.
The proposed road construction will quickly create facts at the same time, at the same time, there is the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive director of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to take the Wissing at the state operation, so far 29 places are occupied.
The IHK demands to give more orders to external offices.
CDU faction vize Christian Baldauf dispoints on calculations of the host of host, the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the order of national roads as proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the lack of skilled workers in the region.
Sobering is also the previous broadband construction in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had been rated the grid supply in an IHK-survey with a score of 3.4.
They complained about stockpiling Internet connections and breaks.
The Eveline Lemke's ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe, where they already cleared out the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi will change 850,000 diesel vehicles - auto producer confronts itself with a counterreal reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
"" "the BMW-Chair" "" "said the company that" "" "there are more intelligent options as driving limits," "" "and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based, to prohibit or limit the diesel vehicles." ""
Daimler announced on Tuesday to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides, which emits diesel engines, are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install the neutralisation of vehicles of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases, also take too what makes it difficult to competitive the price of cars.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to discovers the mighty auto companies and ignore the signs of the problem.
The companies attempt to avoid the failure of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so-called off-age devices that regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged by Volkswagen, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Thermodynamics was arrested in Germany's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be made in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen, after the authorities were accused of being a system installed to deal with the emission provisions in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded.
The inclusion of Audi into the study could make Volkswagen heavy loads: the luxury car manufacturer has disproportionately proportionally to the profit of Volkswagen.

Morillless Knollennasen and the laughter of the suffering
Mordillo was at the time of one of the most widely published Cartoon-Draftsman, the Knollennines of his figures are his trademark.
Even with 85 the Argentinists still records and works on a film.
"" "his message:" "" "laugh," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he proposed himself among others as a sign for congratulatory cards - which was frustrated by him.
"the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris led him the end of the '60s breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match "and then in the" Stern "and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again, the artists were inspired by cities.
Large, roundish mordillo figures were cavorting in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is also sitting still at the drawing, working daily for nearly ten hours.
About calendars, puzzles, books for Gross and Klein, T-Shirts, plush animals and watches find his threatening figures show much spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - a dillos of any animal in his drawings - which has a millennium as a counter-player.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie which should come to the kinoleinwall.
"I don't know what they're saying, it is strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore he sets rather onto the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is powerless produced.
Lavendel: threatened by the climate of climate change
He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is due to the conditions transmitted to drought conditions and due to the illnesses that are transmitted to diseases, scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions, great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert of agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.
This has effects on the life of lavender.
There is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium, which wears the Zwergzipped, and with very dry weather there are very many of them. "
And there is much in the game.
Lavender oil looses not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "instead of having very long crop pipes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil. "
To the solutions that are considered, include a better water distribution and slowing of evaporation made out of the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 year existence.

The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and impending drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what safer to feel: they are supposed to take their children with the office that were the goal of a attack with grenades in 2009 or at home.
Safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: adversary, Neutrale, allies.
They ask the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings.
There are drug mugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no break of violence, while in all the country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto gave up his office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.
Among the latter you find the editor and its irirator of Riodoce, Co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs." ""
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows his Central finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smelling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.
The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Even though a special position was built in 2010, to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the committee, it has led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.
As with the most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug dealers and organic crimes each year, the murderers are only rarely issued by journalists.
At Riodoce, they still consist of treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, although the terrain is now still digitalized.
Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting has little benefits, says Ibarra.
"" "" "" "it is very stupid, my time to waste in this workshop," "" "he says." ""
"as long as we don't know why, we missed all."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce's office in Culiacan's capital.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was shot from two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "Tweld River."
The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to move freely around in Culiacan.
But on the topic Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as riveting fractions are fighting it to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of wounded, two-story Mausoleen for drug-trees that are larger than many homes for the living.
"" "remember for a minute that there is a state of" "" "tranquility" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""
Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.
First of all, there was the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rival antitrust in war with Guzmans's sons.
This publication may have offended the sons, presumed gait bought every copy of the output when it was delivered to newspaper kioske.
The second mistake was to force Valdez to force the same story after the seizure of a different newspaper, which had the same history to leave the country in its own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce's founding member and sold 50 U.S. dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without violating the racotta problem," said Bojorquez.
The newspaper has served as a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took part.
Reporters loved it, hard to publish studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Mary-Moors-Cabot Award" for its reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever they led them.
He gave himself up that he was afraid.
"" "" "" "I would like to live more," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""
Drug dealers in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"you must take the task of taking part in a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.
"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done before so many? why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""
The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird that could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always carry his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love for the routine his calamity?
His death also forced them to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.
"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home runways" "" "to move drugs." ""
"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-proof and self-maintenance.
His own instincts trust.
When it does wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be duped... and then the thing with Javier happens."
The old rules, such as he and others, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous blend of lucrative smugings, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is changing constantly.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were entrusted by the state government to protect the Riodoce's offices in a four-class building of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who called Governor themselves as not trusted.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain country, where drug bound de facto under control.
For the issue of this week Riodoce has captured on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition on the spending, focusing on the hometown of the Governor.
And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the State Office, a kidnapping.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped, or as it happened, so caution was enjoined when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI).
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of highly harvesting cases of corruption.
Villarreal bat the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escapes a military incident.
Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez, considered the best informed source about the kidnapping.
"" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with nickname" "" "El FLACO" "" "because of its slim body." ""
"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something that they never expected, activists in the name of the press.
Reporters Miriam Ramirez snap a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Office.
Salvador Adverge disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests that it is its own.
Journalists have become more loud in the country by organizing the SOS Press "protests in organised protests and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pionate journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth.
She has asked since then, that she is divided by the government because she is worried that her anger violated its objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists entertained in Mexico of organised crime, involved in government officials and a equality of equality. "
In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters did not only be killed by drug bound, but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were organised with organised crime under a ceiling.
Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.
"" "" "" "in Mexico you'll die because you want to keep the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody remembers the death of the Bloginist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas map: "here I am for my report."
A computer keyboard and earphones are adjacent to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in northern border State of Chihuahua after the assassination of the MIROSLAVA Breach in March.
Others keep on how to put El manana by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its directors in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled from their home States or even out of the country.
It is a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the roads and search for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted as it seems to be murdered by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escape from Veracruz.
For those who continue to stay and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, gives that drug dealers scares him.
"" "" "" "Mexico is going to hell, and therefore I became reporters," "" "he said." ""
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to summon.
A series of shooting-shooters with bandages and security forces near the beach Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated, as it was promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the Schodoce's website, they published the latest on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed next day.
Sirens are close to - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.
When they were afraid, they did not show it.
Under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"" "" "" "how can you just think to conclude," "" "said Bojorquez," "" "if the same day, at which Javier was murdered, the internship asked me to send them to the road." "" "" ""
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first sight it looks like a statue, if there is a terrifying.
Now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhinorns of a Canadian miners were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so good that they could even realize that his pinned skin was reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "unfruitful past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the preserved dinosaurs, ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well tolerant condition has explaining it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Radio when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
He met something that appeared from the surrounding rock failed on the place, and decided to look closely.
The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 Pounds (1,100 kg).
After all this hard work, the ready result is ready to be revealed.
"" "" "" "if you have just blind with eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "" "said the main gate Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible." ""
"" "" "" "it will go into history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs." "" "" ""
Researchers found out that this plant-eater, though it is covered with a armor, and resembles a wall, probably threatened by meat-eaters dinosaurs.
The strong mored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide in front of predatory, and used a parachuting technique that is known as a countercremation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better to interfere in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creation from the family of Nodosaurier came from the headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and Borealopelta markmitchelli is named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.
It enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armaments over his body.
They discovered the conspirators, a widespread defense method in animal life, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.
Although the convection is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta is far beyond the animals of today.
It indicates that the dinosaurs was chased out of sufficient pressure by the carnivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was favourable as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that deploy the consolation - think about deer, zebras, or girdles - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this nodosaurier had been exposed to a true struggle.
"strong predatory behaviours on a massive, highly contaminated dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rob have been the chalk time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.
Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including his preserved Darmintes to find out what it eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, ran into a river and driven into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserving skin, but also has been preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early chalk time." ""
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just need a little with the eyes, you could almost believe he is at bedtime. "
The chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, had gone through the earth.
Although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the mored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.
The scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was soaked after death in the sea and in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Radio when he was at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to thigh.
The creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long spikes, which was raged by his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was drilled through the Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.
But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the Hautrek still cover up prickles panels along the dinosaurs.
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto.
The more I know it, the more confusing it becomes.
The remaining remains of the skin still cover the holprides anti-tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread out.
I can count the scales at its sole. '
In the thunderstorm: Massarambolage on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night at the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage collage.
There are numerous injured, kilometres-long bar and Gaffer.
On the afternoon of Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon.
After the first data of the police were at 17.00 o'clock between the junction of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a storm, almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, alternating.
Regarding the exact number of injured parties no data updated.
It was about mild to moderate injuries, said a police preacher.
An enormous array of life vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
A ten-kilometer long backdrop in Munich was formed in the direction of Munich.
As a AZ reporter reports, it was also on the counter-way to massive disabilities - through numerous gaffer.
The fire brigade notated the markings of the vehicle manufacturers, which now have to count with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident happened at the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transport and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: group testing "Comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing else sitting on the train and sleeps.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea.
And then: buffered.
Comes the conductor, wakes an unclean, or taketh up the gast in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of breaks are over soon.
The Deutsche Bahn currently testers the created ticket control.
It's simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken his place, and thus alustomed the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.
"" "" "" "comes the offer, we expand it out." ""
"" "it is expected to be available in Germany early next year," "" "said a railway speaker." ""
"comfort Check-in" calls the train ticket ranking without Schaffner.
In order to be able to use, however, some conditions have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do.
It also has to be bought through the app by rail, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
For the "comfort check-in" works so: you ascend to the train, calling his ticket to "My tickets".
In the test customers, a button on the electronic survey is released.
The pull leaders get a message to their mobile devices that the gast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat seat.
Comes the train conductor of the ticket control at No. Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already unofficial online ticket.
So you can still go on to sleep, keep silent, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.
"" "" "" "who wants to travel without ticket control through our train companion, check out the DB navigator yourself." ""
This allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train's personal journey, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Manager of DB correspondence.
Second-plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter into individual customer needs."
Those who travel often, knows that in addition to delay and passions the ticket controls are one of the biggest medical products.
Because often one does not have any documents in any case, but it does not need any documents you need for the application of online tickets.
Either missing the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be shown.
The result is endless discussions between drawbacks and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the abyss or large space and delays in the control of your own tickets and take the Schaffner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
This also applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Just one day after it arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb-apartment, which they rented and scroll by Facebook on their phone.
She stumbled upon a post of somebody from the High School.
"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the road" "" "it was there." ""
Confused as nobody else had posted on their feedback, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on its timeline.
The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was there, death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., was killed.
He posted a picture of browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "he thought about himself." ""
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
They put their cell phone to buy tweets on people on the Canfield drive later on the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people, who cried out, and from a man who claimed that Browns to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed at which a policeman was faced with protesters in front of a group of demonstrators.
In another video, she said, secured a different policeman and cried, "I will kill you... Pets all kill you."
"it is not common," Ferrell remembers their testimony.
"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we used to accustomed to call ourselves." "" "" ""
At this moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and wept. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she won her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas down from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people who live in community life and have filled the streets to ask answers.
As ferrell with her daughter, which carried a flower-dress, and a perfect crown, came to Ferguson, making them both a conversation, which they had numerous times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."
"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "they remembered that which she said." ""
"" "" "" "we go now to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year old boy, and that wasn't right." ""
I could not take it away, "said Ferrell later.
"what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
It must know and see it and up.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the luck to give her a experience, in which they personally do not experience ecatant racism, it is not unlike the next black women child.
"" "I have the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to keep them far away." "" "" ""
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Floral Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground as the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson waited.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local businessowner who made lunch.
They made bags before and helped to pass on protesters.
Slowly started a new kind of activism for Ferrell's form.
"my activism has changed after the 9th of August, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
"" "everything has come." "" "" ""
Weeks later, Ferrell arrived in an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farmers wanted to only document what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area responsible for his activism around Todestract-Insular occupants.
His commitment was closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns shot.
"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis said.
"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as those people are portrayed, because I will be shown." "" "" ""
The aim was to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is "not a Messiah guide, but in order to act a community that comes together," said Folayan, and proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, as she loves and marry her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the realization of black people." "" "" ""
Furthermore, Ferrells's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the murder of the black teenage Trayby Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify itself as gay.
"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting with different fronts.
Black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything. "
"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmatical type of action," in which, based on its identity as the heart of the film was chosen.
"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.
"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front of the front, because in a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman so much at stake." ""
You can sense your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial relations between the church and the police have continued to exist.
He is based on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."
Nevertheless she clung to singing and she feels committed to this memory, since she walked in Ferguson three years ago.
"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love one another and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "dreams" to "megaahn": TV reader discuss about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although they are not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern edge of the pedestrian street has been splits in support for the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly can be cold.
The topic also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While the one at the Bit Gallery said: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need man" (Siggi Balls) or simply simply: "size!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, as well as the other business benefits, fear the adversaries, that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding.
Added: the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market stands in the 13 direct marketing products.
Construction work will conclude with the start of the construction work.
The gallery macher want to integrate a market place in the new building - in fact for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "we've been selling almost weekly in the Peasantry thalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maidens always loves again.
The butcher shop also discovered us.
We would wish that, during and, especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, there are also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "whether the direct market in a market hall is located in the gallery, get to the height of the rent.
"" "this is likely to be low in the new project." "" "" ""
Eva Kilic: "what shopping is in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drinke- or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.
There is enough in our city.
One can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
But since it's not even a regular weekly market, it is more important that at least the market hall should be preserved.
After all, the goods offered at the service is fresh, mostly offered by the producer and is extremely clean.
As you can see, shop stores are rented in a shopping center only by bigger firms, because the local anets are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, special business are almost no longer and that which is still left, will probably still disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market stands doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit in Bitburg.
Especially: where should the farmers market place during the construction time?
The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the Bit Gallery is actually coming.
Or does it make the ghosts bit-Gallery to drive all businesses from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "it simply won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs no one.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery.
But for a peasant hall, yes, thanks to the sincere many - how I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.
When the farmers markets are broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible, the similar to cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of cheeks-tups and hair cuts that were sent to Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out the excerpts from prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analytical minister served a 35-year sentence after it publicly made diplomatic messages about the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was founded in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that might be extracted from Manning and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone could not only look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also to identity.
Manning, born as Bradley, was born in 2013, but has already been talking about the identification as a woman, has been sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde seduces - with which it was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came on from the great success of their 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigars pumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition." ""
And she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated Muse were sentenced to unequal spectacles over the course of two years.
They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Supporters Images," which would like to predict the future in which the President Chelating would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama actually only had a few days after the book was released, Mannings would call for release seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison, was a welcome kind of happy communions.
There is also an exhibition at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and towards transgender troops to find out new, tweezers, which he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen to a certain reason."
In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called upon Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic fatigue, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millennium release of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped that the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific icon of the artist) show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological respects, we all are.
"" "" "" "what people hopefully will take away is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and like openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to see." ""
"DNA data can tell you so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."
The last piece in the exhibition located in an own room is one page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning, as she emerged with a free spins in hand from the disciplines of the United States, as King of Hong Kong.
"" "" "" "if they are chill your speech, then they have won." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "so don't stop the mouth." "" "" ""
"" "" "" "it came straight out of a letter which she wrote to me," "" "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia." ""
"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I speak about it." "" "" ""
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted to look forward in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed into the center of the masks, from their own genomic Simulakras, which are like hordes of protesters.
It was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, until the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), with which their genetic happers were written with pencil.
"" "" "" "in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," "" "Dewey-Hagborg said from the portraits." ""
"" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, who formed in Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind their liberation." "" "" ""
Professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
A nationwide man hunting is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who was found as suspects, after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as announced at Cook's District Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found victims of several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared on the site of the action for dead, and detective investigates the stitches as murder, while the police is active according to the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University in 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now being urned and excluded from the entrance of Northwestern University's campus.
"this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperated with this investigation," said Cubes.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
"" "a speaker of the University and the Silville College said in an e-mail statement that" "" "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help U.S. investigation authorities in any memorable way." "" "" ""
The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want it to be.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urge the suspects to face the authorities.
"" "" "" "the police have a vision of her residence, and our efforts to locate them," "" "said Guglielmi." ""
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help us find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza building which had just received a mysterious tip that happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident happened on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants: "the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"we will close the WADA timetable in the near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko
Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world-anti-doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"in a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA-schedule has been updated in this regard, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA program to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-creation of RUSADA and published recently on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could be concerned for Russia.
"everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future. "
However, one of the criteria reported in the list referred to as the Russian anti-Doping authorities approved the reported results from the WADA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to the alleged state sponsored doping in Russian sport.

All measures have been implemented.
"" "but there was no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist." "" "" ""
Mutkos voted to agree with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-Doping commission.
In conversation with Russian sales office rsports at the beginning of the day Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report of controversial positions and regulations may contain.
No one has to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the WADA Doping scandals from the implementation of doping control in Russia in November 2015.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow in July, WADA-General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA declared "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi does not sell any eggs yet
They shared the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, it could not be assumed for any health impairment, it was reported in the message.
From now, only eggs are delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negative for fixation-containing anti-eyectives.
Aldi wants to establish clarity and transparency to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your staff good luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.
Answers were often vage, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.
And even if you promised Anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who operates 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." ""
She called people from the outside to help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at Wachsen to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to address surveys, Special groups and demographic groups, and in some cases Whistleblowern allow to bypass the C-suite management and turn directly to the Board of Directors.
"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees.
Errett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.
In addition to the Snap Polls and Polls of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows a look at a glance which show Units the Most Complaints and which managers are low-approved results - so that you can drill out why.
Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture, so that you have not been involved in scandals that an ex-post office has been published since then a former employee describes a blog post, where those who have spoken are punished.
For start-ups like Glint this desire is an overview of a lucrative business possibility.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance-industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial technical website let's talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convert, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year, amidst the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.
Convert has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
As Glint, Convert Company makes custom-made "Puls-" Polls send confidential responses in real time and watch the warmth-maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive board is involved, complaints are to the Supervisory Board.
"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convert.
If a company is found that his employees are badly treated or unethical, it can experience precious consequences due to consumers' boycott, workers of fluoriation and clerings, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has hired Convert for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and a simple way to achieve its headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or email to the company headquarters, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.
Now since the company is converting the Convert, problems that were previously identified by executives that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or irregular trainees were identified and addressed.
"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""
"and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employees in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen broke up with the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "Social Media" came to their right "that businesses realized that they could not prevent their dirty clothes online.
"before using technology to monitor ethics, people use hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and load the companies with recurrent fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, which both supports start-ups.
Convert received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the entire capital raised to $47 million.
Only $10 million in November from Bessemer venture partner and brought its total funding to $60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's staff expect more jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.
The employees want the feeling that you accept and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which is both Convert and Glint." ""
Investors reach Renditch, when their portfolio company run well. companies run smoothly when employees are involved and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise third promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder you will find support.
The data on employees of the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless when the administrator of a company does not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees to your feedback, it can have expectancy that change is on the way.
And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this can motivate disappointments and motivating employees.
"if you have to ask 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the business management company Kotter International, who has seen the company to be very keen on collecting data.
"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the staff," "" "Do you really hear me?" ""
Do you care about that?
And if you don't care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys now, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so errett.
And after the feedback of frustrated employees it was due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.
On Ruby Tuesday the company will always get new insights over employees, and it hopes for a long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector, which is known for high sales.
"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"and if you lose people, you will also lose our customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
At 23 o'clock there is a lot of UCLA football player on one side of the new exercise fields on the campus.
Some have drawn their tricot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these untill minutes do a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three-hour exercise, before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6: 30 am.
"" "" "" "this is for the guys the next three days a real waiter mill," "" "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday to Tuesday." ""
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of the player, and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA at 19: 15 should start to meet the already completed time plans for players.
The compromise on the two days is more than a day, where Bruins moved the beginnings of the camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Westwood practical exercises.
They are supposed to have 18 exercises in the course of August 18. 20 before the formal game preparations for their prelude against Texas A & M in September.
MORA said that he will support the rules change of NCAA, even if they add the much employment routes of the player another point.
"" "" "" "we put these enormous load three or four days on it, and it is very challenging," "" "said Mora." ""
"and they just pressed through, they placken up, they are great people.
"" "" "" "I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great." "" "" ""
The UCLA will end their practices as soon as the Camp is finished, what has been overthrown in view of the clear sight of its fields, adjacent to the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the higher class, which will already be equipped with foot balls, which will be a protective net behind a Torpfob space.
Bruins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season.
"we will use our security," Mora said.
"" "" "" "this is a real problem, and it's not far too fetched to think that the people there rent a room and then set it up to record a exercise." ""
If you have the video clip of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking 8.
We will do the best thing we have.
Therefore I am not worried too much.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit messages to third parties and their results at the original contribution then, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. it's one of his efforts to fight so-called Fake News.
The company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize the possible counterfeit software and to send them on factapping, the possibly results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main focus points for so-called Fake News, many of which believe that they also have influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has become subject to a major political topic in Europe, with the French voters being flooded during the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany does not support a plan to eliminate the social media networks, as before the election there will be swift fast as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook in a separate statement in German, that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts review.
"in addition to the realization that stories of facebook-checked third parties want to focus on profound decisions concerning what they read and share," said Sara, Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog.
It added that Facebook must continue to test its feature "in conjunction with the article," and in other changes to his news feedback, to reduce wrong news.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a canophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy headquarters in the Conscious River valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful on the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says," ""
"what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands."
'A Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist, Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brianna May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly.
"" "" "" "I only wrote on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double female in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""
"this is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time they lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as it would be there even though.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who was beaten with old papers that he will be supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") this seems to be true to be true.
Rhodesdos spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the mounted hyena heads on walls and bottles which had spent centuries in trenches.
He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access to 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.
When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the loft. "
Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps that represent what they possessed: "one could mean that land confollicte would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.
Guys, let's go all his gear! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view a wider basis into the English history, among them 'The Labourer', who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse dating back to 1381.
"there is a record of an uproar which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes.
"the peasantry started in this field and I thought, an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected with each other? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit Paters that the family Darrell hid seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler' in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell portrayed out of the 18th century, which filled his own funeral (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the men seemed to be the right gauner to make debts and spend money for things that they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell-men put their debtors to marry their old women - I introduce them as a heap of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlocked. "
After the end of its use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique screaming experience
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness of a comic novel about Elongänmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been recalled again by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like me, "Oh, now I have to get back with the damned life."
Campaign launched: covered over 300 years old Marian's chapel in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marichapel in Rhöndorf, the City of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand (Rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto NEUHOFF and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan.
At the end of August, there will be a celebration on the island Grafenwerth at the end of August.
"too beautiful for us.
Or?, "ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"we think this (of course!) do not really think," write them on their last unlocked website.
"but we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make it clear that much better is better than it seems.
Basically, we are the firm conviction that we considered as bad honeybee citizens to know the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
In action there is more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"" "" "" "it is true to formulate a single-standing promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique site." "" "" ""
After all, they stand in the competition with other municipalities.
A middle five-digit amount allows the city of Bad Honnef to re-use their new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the Army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) will be adjusted for retirement and transport.
So also this week.
On the first glance a normal operation.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The session was held no longer in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Among the consultations, under the presidency of the government, the five vice-premieres as well as the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part.
So the civilians in the Yas were in the number.
The government pulls the reins in the military.
Deputy Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were removed.
Since the failed Coup has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirers since the failed coup.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile-Predigers Fethullah Gülen, Erdogan as a wire paddle.
Around 486 people, which were directly involved in the coup attempt, is negotiated by Ankara since this week.
"" "on the day after the coup, Erdogan was named" "" "God's gift" "", "as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces." "" "" ""
But Erdogan is the army really in grip?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncertainty in the Military Headquarters."
In the general staff, there are Besorgations for an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifest themselves in the lifting of the case for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the large-wing unit in the army and security forces still goes on.
In mid-July, Erdogan sent another 7395 stataters, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed as Erdogan was tamed the military.
Generals were formerly known as the real masters of the country.
Three times, they ruled their role as a guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan sailed the power of the military by step, not least under vocation to reform the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is conducting an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a well-known officer, who was seeking refuge in the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and oafists in a few years.
"" "" "" "does this affect the Nato could not be cold." ""
There is no doubt in the alliance after the purge of doubts about the willingness to serve the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational skills be "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
He looks to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for the approval of Visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families-oriented Visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"" "" "" "this law will reduce poverty, save wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by the United States to change the way as the citizens from other countries" "" "Green Cards" "". "" ""
The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system.
"" "" "" "this new application procedure will meet the candidates who are English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge of our economy," "" "said Trump, quoted from the American media." ""
Ministry wants to travel route to the shuttle bus
Again, over the past few months, the future of the racing drivers had been fought - now it is supposed to be very fast.
Even before the end of the year the tourist railroad, on which the travel route is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the racing drivers in the long term, according to the public transport service, the construction work will begin in this year.
"" "" "" "with the decision to continue and order the track Ilmenau-racing stiffles, and confesses the country in particular for the tourism important connection," "" "stated Transport State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt." ""
The costs for the repair of the track amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
This sum exceeds 75 percent of this sum.
The contract, based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country, will now be final, stated Sühl.
The Ministry and South-üringen Rail as the operator agree on the technical details already.
"" "" "" "the roadmap, the vehicles used for vehicles and quality standards," "" "said Sühl." ""
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.
That would be regular to be ordered for the race-pavement shuttle on December 2017.
The speedway shuttle is an especially popular rail connection between the train stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
Over the past few months, it was tested in the course of a pilot project, whether the distance of sufficiently many people is used to order them regularly in the future.
The circuit is also heavily blown up in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it can not be reunited in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robot.
Yes, actually.
Sex robot is currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernagel.
"people are making fun, but the companies provide a lot of them, and we will see them more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern Sexpuffs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silica that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can modify his robot in accordance with his beliefs "and thereby select everything from the eye color of the robot about the form of nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.
But it will worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford-wife progressive.
Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silica.
The RealBotix robot makes it possible for example their users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as for instance.
And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relapy and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
It also has its moods throughout the day - just like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation or can be "in mood!"
There are many worrisome aspects on this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female properties that goes to rape if one step on Frigid (means: conflicting) Farrah is concerned, discomfort one at most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.
"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" is it on the site.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys.
Their emergence and increasingly refinement refer to something dark and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire to having sex with underpation as an optional addition.
Most men are of course not holding sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity, they still remain in the verge of consumer culture.
But what leakened out of the boundary zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, be very instructive.
And many people are not strange or offensive until they have given the free market to them.
However, there is a certain surge that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time that the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a presidents in the White House so that it has become sexually assorted to have women sexually attacked.
The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic pictures, the enclosures and outsidered eyes, but how realistic this vision is effective.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this won't feel like a big jump.
The target behind these sex robots is to have a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although also with pornostar proportions).
Their builder, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in the point, when it comes to "Personalities," the robots do not constitute real women.
They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that might disturb on independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 language: maid service
Trumps big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy human mind
It has become a Binsenweishness of Trump-era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voters, also have families split into small size.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.
We all reportedly pledged to take advantage of our filter bubbles.
The power of Trumps, Families, has been less noticed.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago and has lived for a long time with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
They reminded me that the unity of a joint enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including Republican relationship, with whom they fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context, that this also brings significant risks.
The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting impact of his presidency has the power to push us all right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his mittens will not be discharged by one day.
However, there is a still afraid of long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an epitome of veronableness.
I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's kompetitive version of crazy (but at least we knew how his tax statement saw) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur in a very mild strapping.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only intellectually healthy to qualify as a measurable improvement.
When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussel of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need any caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are becoming old, the Skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not yet over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the big roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, because here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women can go on it and all have a great time.
If I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody was asked afterwards.
On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before using my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same thing plus the option to reduce the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This does not only lead to a slow exchange of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation, which is not required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologized, while I tired the experience, to submit my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from the prison to the hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital for the second time.
Last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schcircumcised in his craft, which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after a appeal of prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steelamp in the early morning of the Valentine's Day in 2013, by firing them several times by a door of the toilet paper in his house in Pretoria, on her.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder, who hidden himself in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal to the six year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell which they say they are to be spinning.
The National Prosecution Authority reported that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There are no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger Schools the quadricular plants from Fewer and Epfenhofen were released for vacations and schooling schools.
Three of the dismissed students will continue to high school, four at the secondary school.
Head of Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental community in Epfenhofen.
The 29 pupils of the four classes selected under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Medes a young eagles which grows in the hen, but then released into freedom.
In addition, the mlower shar led a musical with the title "The eagle in the poultry farm."
Farmer Arnold took a strange egg, and left it from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken shudder came out a little eagles.
But the hope of making a chicken, the eagles beat on a high mountain its wings, and broke out.
Afterwards the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young Gockles, which wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagles stand for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
The young was different than the other young ones (chicks), but belong to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
They wish every fourth-watery that he feels in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the previous school director Michael Mueller, who jumps over again with material strains, and the parents.
The cooking time is now over, declared classmate Sophia Schumacher.
They leave their school after two years of instruction only very much, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they can rely on the square-watery.
Finally, all students would sound a song of summer time and holiday time.
He broke out great joy in the children.
Eight winners are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested on Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal Campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal people were arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, she was released, while the examination was underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported BTV that Bulgarians was later released.

Software update for diesel vehicles: what the affected now need to know
How precisely is the software update instead?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in an overview.
In the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They should improve the emission-behavior of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from it.
Anja Smetanin at the ACE car Club Europe gives an assessments:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the traded software updates are optional.
"" "" "" "the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles which have Schumann's software," "" "Anja Smetanin says." ""
The rearmament is arranged by the Federal Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers announced a long-day implementation in the coming months, but also called no exact date.
Daimler is communicated to write every person affected.
If anyway, if it is an inspection, it will be done in their framework.
How long will the upgrades arise?
"hard to say," Smetanin says.
The hangings of the manufacturer, as well as from the political pressure.
"because we have seen that voluntary actors do not act on the subject of environment so far."
How long should the update last?
The upgrade itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-consuming could be, to get an appointment.
What makes drivers who do not drive a car of BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group?
The ACE will wait for wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would draw, so smetalanine.
Is a massive rise of Euro-4 cars now?
The ACE doesn't fear that.
But in the regions where drivers are threatening.
In the rural area, there are no losses for older diesel.
The ACE will advises you to wait for sale.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize was given to President Trump to become politically.
One of the winners will not come - protest.
Ll Cool J (49) gets the first Rapper one of the coveted International Kennedy Center.

Awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join together with his wife Melania on the award ceremony.
The Lear's progressive TV series announced that this is why Lear already announced that the participation in the Gala was announced.
"" "the New York Times," "" "he said," "" "this Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw from the resources - and that burdened me." "" "" ""
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized them to take a conversation with bump to clear their view.
The Kennedy Center, named after the former President, John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The earlier award winners are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city alive
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes to retirement in the next year.
The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumer is a tacker.
And his work still makes him great fun, as he conveys in the press process.
He reports from varied, but also demanding tasks that wait for his successors.
At the same time, it amazes him that so far no application does not fulfill the requirement profile.
The town is looking for an architect or building engineer at the nearest time.
This is how to pay attention to regular breakers - not enough time for a working revision.
Since Haslach was acting as a sub-building authority, the applicant has to suggest the applicant.
For this function wants to keep the city definitely.
If it is no longer able to fill them, the citizens would have to drive up to Offenburg.
But the proximity of the city and himself is important, Wacker who reports from a good service climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
More than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back to hackers with pride.
"" "" "" "we make the city alive," "" "he is sure about the building and his staff safe." ""
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhofenparkplatz are present.
The theatrical bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium occupies.
The latter is to beat with around 1.5 million euros alone, "when we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"all in all, great tasks wait for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
Be confiscated for a city building large play room.
With Haslachs's own building yard and gardener, it can be flexibly reacted as flexible.
"one can move much," so hackers, and the design of green spaces will often lobbish by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monument protection, it is important to have an eye for that which cleans "if new buildings are approved, stresses the separating Stadtbauchery.
The Stadtbauchery bears great responsibility anyway.
He is a builder, "at the end everything runs all about my table."
In cooperation and coordination he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been around for 15 years.
Also, his successor remains too long, Wacker said: "we are looking for someone who really identifies and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good service climate but also for the further design of the city.
If anyone would like to bury Roland Wacker, should study the city of Haslach as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with technical direction architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction plan law.
Building and civil engineering, building planning, construction planning, adunderwerage, administration of urban property buildings, urban farm building with building yard and urban development authority, including monument protection authority, including monument protection.
Thrown by bike: southern route locked
The police have previously unknown the blue bicycle from the railway station in the area of Leobese Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged, that the subsequent freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators go from two male servants and look for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene there were a rosary roller and a bike driver has been observed.
"" "" "" "that goes far beyond a Lausitz region," "" "said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA." ""
The perpetrators, or the perpetrators, have brought themselves into large danger and endangered the train traffic.
Besides the damage at the Lok and the facility as well as the delay-minutes and the cost of rail vehicles could also return to the perpetrators.
All in all, there was a "significant" sum, "said the narrator.
The damages were fixed on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern track could be led without disability.
Almost ten people went out Friday morning, two of them concerned the correspondence.
Goods were not made out, but they had delay.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200-metre raping had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meats, dairy products and chocolate might help to relieve IBD (unbundle intestine)
Red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.
But a new study asserts precisely the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases can ease.
The unbearable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA, caused by stomach cramps and blood vessels, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme drowsiness.
During those affected normally, meat and dairy products are advised to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote immune cells.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in eating is not penetrate into the body.
Cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to delicate tissues.
If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it may result an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance gives immunity in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their initiates.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the baubles of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had their immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan has rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system is working with humans.
The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated.
She presumed that the difference to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice of the mice became DNA sequenced and there were six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them failed in mice.
Mice have been reared in a sterile environment so that they had no intestinal microbiom and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria broke out on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant promoting cells.
As the active component of the liquid is cleansed, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as the Indol-3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant immune cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our stomach-intestinal markets.
It is unknown whether tryptophan by products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people such as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells contribute to the inside surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United is engaged with Nemanja Matic a "genius"
At Manchester United has signed an "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut at Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Cup in real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressed in the holder role as people marched like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what Mourinho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks he's football," said Mourinho.
"we will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started to launch its launch-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted to wish three further new commitments, but he insisted that the club has already made a "fantastic job" to meet three of his four relevant new commitments.
"three of them to get there, I thank the association," he added.
"" "" "" "I will be happier if they get four of four, but they have given great effort." "" "" ""

New proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind is twisted: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD boss, the Prime Minister had always faced with a certain concern to Berlin.
Just no storks from the party centre, just no headwind from the band - this was the most important desire of the election fighting.
Since Martin Schulz has changed the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the employees have been watching the Willy-Brandt-Haus with growing disagreements and events in the state-governed state capitals.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described with counterwind.
There were deep precipitation.
And one after the other.
The Federal CDU looks after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"" "" "" "this shows once more: red-green cannot be reliable," "" "said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editor of Germany (RND)." ""
The surprising fractionist of an Greens Parliamentary Group has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.
Five months before the local elections, his red-green coalition lost their A-votes majority to the Opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal State Secretary, Michael Kellner, asked the sloping down of the Green Party of Elke Tire to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear interrogation of the voters.
Elke Tire must immediately return their mandate, "said the Federal Executive Officer and the campaign of the Greens to the Green Network (RND).
"" "" "" "this must not be true for all," "" "she sighed with a SPD candidate, when on Friday morning the new hiobsmessage had reached the party headquarters." ""
Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is facing the green members of Elke Tear to the CDU without its own government.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state.
And nobody knows what next comes.
The Misere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more, did not calm down the comrades at the time.
According to the parliamentary elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
It was even worse - and it became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD immediately, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smoothly.
Boasting the comrades in the weeks afterwards again.
Then when she had exhausted new courage, the G-20 Summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next descent.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD faction, lost its Nimbus at that weekend, because he was sitting in Elbphilharmonie, while his city was burnt.
And because he didn't make anything wrong in the crisis communication, what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW-exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower-Saxon Prime Minister had already been in criticism.
Miese reversal values came added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just that, because in the past weeks, Weil tried to get more strongly in the Confederation of Akzente.
Comrades in the context of Martin Schulz did not hide his power in Berlin's former mayor of Hannover to build his power in Berlin.
They let him grant him, because they were given a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite may occur.
Thereby, because of the parties compulsive, the lower-Saxon nature is basically no fault.
And Schulz not at all.
At times, the comrades therefore endeavour to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is committed to the green, and above all on the abrogue parliamentarians in the lifejackets.
"" "" "" "it is unbearable and democratic, such as Ms Tlifejackets their own career times about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party companies in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network Germany (RND). "" "
Mrs. Tire is not elected because of its person as a direct candidate, but over the state list of the Dutch Green Party in parliament, so the Anglo-Saxon parliamentarians continues.
The logical consequence, it would be that she returns their mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains a "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"" "" "" "the voters for four years ago was clear:" "" "men have made Stephan Weil's prime minister," "" "says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the Bundestag to the RND." ""
"" "" "" "now the personal career raging of a future CDU Parliamentary Group," "" "said Oppermann further." ""
He called to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know if there was more or more detailed reports of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding of the town centre III
Anyone who wants to renovate his own house in the years can come from the country.
In addition to this, Mayor, Albert Schindler, and three representatives of urban development on Wednesday in sensations.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler released a review of the previous year.
Since 1991, it has been in sensitivity areas.
Back then, in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004, the Baden-Württemberg state took over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In the district area II from 2005 to 2016, the supplement was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler the existing renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, and not only new construction areas.
On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that it will be a renovation area III.
The funding amount of 833 333 Euro, including 500 000 Euro from the country, the rest of the community sensations.
How is a rehabilitation area?
One will continue to investigate so Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role, whether in the planned area, interest in interest, sanitation.
If necessary, the territorial limits could then be moved again.
On Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Cellar presented the contents of the federal government program "Social town," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program are the revitalisation of internal towns, improving the residential and labour conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be objective, that is, per property.
The renovation area would eventually be defined as a statute.
The approval period for the funding will have been running since 1st January 2017 until April 30, 2026.
Even until September this year, however, only once the changes will be carried out, as part of those who have received a questionnaire for the replenishment.
In November or December, the rules of statute will be made to begin with the renovations in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then stated that every municipality had to be carried out prior investigation.
It is therefore to evaluate the urban miscircumstances and decide when sanitation is renovated and in what extent.
It will also be entered into the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come again after emotion and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized, a major success factor for the project was the participation of shareholdings.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that would be sent to citizens in the coming weeks, and can be filled out after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Property-piece" in which it comes to the structural condition and the renovation purposes.
"" "the grey questionnaire, the" "" "household and housing" "", "can be made information on size, distribution, and inhabitant of a housing." ""
"" "the blue" "" "work bow" "" "is only complete when building commercial premises." ""
However, to be aware, Gotzel showed that a modified questionnaire was not simultaneously an application for funding.
Moreover, new building measures are not eligible.
Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of funding in accordance with the "" "" Windhoff Principle "" "" - who first comes first, framed first. "" "
They could not be "reserve" for later. "
Finally, photos of the project "Municipalities II" were shown to make the presence of a refurbishment "tasty".
British inventor sets itself a microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and by car.
A British inventor is the first in the country, which is equipped with a microchip, so that he can enter his doorstep, enter his office and even can start with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index and offers now the service for companies and individuals that want to simplify your life with technology through its company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants to ensure that the implant process is carried out after medical standard.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the palaces on houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip, everything for an additional cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to the American production last month, taxpayers will cost taxpayers according to the military personnel sent to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American builders.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 countries.
In addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire-blowing from Wisconsin and a forklift truck, manufactured in Connecticut.
The White House's military office called for the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before helicopter landed on the South Lawn by the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of helicopters.
"" "" "" "I just wanted you to be aware, because it is an unusual event with great visibility," "" "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy military commander for aviation." ""
The message shown that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn at the South Lawn for the event, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.
Note that if the departure from the White House was delayed, due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.
The initial air conditioning was during the event during the helicopter while security personnel remained at the plane during the time at the plane.
The records provided by the TIME was not clear, if ultimately, a second flight issue was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal secretary, government property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could harm.
"" "" "" "one question we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "" "wrote the commander." ""
"sounds like you are locked," the deputy commander answered.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts towards containment of government legislation.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically acceptable purposes.
Presidents are obligated to use them for the journey.
But its use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump caused an investigation into the investigation as the presidential plane in front of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that would complain about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessors.
"" "" "" "the White House is thrilled by the show" "" "Made In America" "" "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," "" "said the Deputy press conference of the White House, Lindsay Walters." ""
HMX-1 crews often lead training flights in the region around Washington and in South Lawn by turning the U.S. President at the White House with precise peak of centimetable.
As Trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 led 58 exercise climates throughout the White House.
"" "the flight for the" "" "Made in America" "" "event had the training requirement for the month, said an official." ""
Helicopter Units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for "non-presidential support committees."
The White House said that the taxpayers were not the burden for any of the other props that were presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said the company had not been involved to put the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the US Ministry of Defense for the 2017 budget for fiscal year 2017, the DOD substitute for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight hour.
Records of the unit, flight time of the airplane, took 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House asserts that the actual costs for the operation of helicopters are far below that rate.
"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers based on paragraphs is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""
"these estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs, which are contained in yearly resources."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the attachments for DOD does not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract statements.
At that time, the former Pressure-precher of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopters for the event.
"" "" "" "the idea is to present these week things which are manufactured in America," "" "said Spicer." ""
"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it.
And I think like most of the Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked untirelessly.
It is of course appropriate to emphasize it. "
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter, when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire-blowing.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"" "" "" "I know Sikorsky very well," "" "said the president," "" "I have three of them." "" "" ""
TC BW Neuss in front of tricky task
Top leader of the second tennis-league in the table advanced Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss kicks off tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel on the SV tabs.
Despite five games still makeroser balance, the leader of the second tennis court has received the sense of reality.
In any respect, team boss Marius Zay certainly respect respect of the opponent.
"it is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just in the back positions, I find the team very well. "
For class and stability at the SV Suchsdorfer SV especially the imports from the high north.
"their Danish and Finns can even point to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay with view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Oread, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerbrüus (all Denmark).
"it will be as hard for us.
You also need a good portion of happiness. "
The Neussers team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Jan4.
Even at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active Frenchman did not get to the Bundesliga match, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) is competing in this season at the Czech Liberec venue Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic).
The previously undefeated chili Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusians Andrei Vasilevski still at ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be in Kiel, but also like Botic Van de Zandprep, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Alster could again press Máté Valkusz.
Enough for the 18-year-old Hungarians, who was the number one of the junior World Rankings in January 2016, does not fill someone from the trainee by Marius Zay.
How America can damage OMV
Really happy, Donald Trump did not work when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature under the law of tightening the sanctions against Russia.
"in his hunter, the law enacted," Congress held a few "unconstitutional provisions" in order, corrosive.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels is foaming against the U.S. advance.
After all, the draft to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
Based on worrying, investors of the native OMV, which co-financed jointly with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Service Nord Stream 2.
The Drohkulisse is massive.
Nevertheless, it is too early for the estimate of the consequences, thus the official statement of the Group company.
In fact, Donald Trump had to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life.
Twelve weapons are given him to choose.
"" "" "" "the press" "" "has seen itself which the corporation could repel and which could really hurt him." ""

Roll backwards: the city introduces 46 kitchen staff.
The town organises the Kita midtable again.
Fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban daycare centres the clock will be turned back.
As of September 1, the City of Krefeld will take over the municipal kindergarten of daycare facilities (Kitas).
"" "for Sonja Pommerance, deputy director in the field of youth aid, this is a good news:" "" "we are all very happy." "" "" ""
Boiled out of the house: a Caterpillar takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled.
The city runs out in the fields of 46 daycare facilities, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year of kitten, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.

"the employees are assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seventeen-grouped facilities - decides about the timetable.
"the kitchen women are now firm to the Kita team," says Pommeranz.

More than 500 employees work in the factory, which next to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.
In recent years McVities owner Plai said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives "would be" first experienced, "if their activities would change.
In a letter to the Manager of the company called GMB Scotland McVitie's to express "doubts that financing for the modernization of production lines will not be predriven."
"" "GMB-Senior-organizer Drew Duffy, said:" "" "the fact that we have no clarity of the general manager and investment plans for the future of rabies, affects our members deeply." ""
Generations of families have been working here and the workers must focus on the local community and the large-scale Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination.

Did the PSG Barcelona warned three years before Neymar?
The page of La Liga likes to regret her interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in their persecution of Neymar after deducting a £189 million in order to dissolve its freewheel clause, but they warned Barcelona in front of the world record three years ago?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sportsmen in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is livid about the way, as Neymar has forced its way outside, although a source near the Catalans state is that the club has always been given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago from the PSG president in front of this view?
When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club, who wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will contact them in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"we respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players in themselves, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG clearly stated that they would not allow it to go to the International International from Italy, and Barcelona managed to feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their prizes for Neymar.

Interview: "Dominion-atzen report, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domregatta-Report for the abuse of the Pope John Ratzinger.
This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report for the mislead scandal at the Regensburger Domspau continued for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement, "We are Church," explained according to the publication of the German Press Agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger Bishop and today, Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express her deep regret about their own underside or their then false assessment of the incident.
"" "the Vatican Law," "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence with" "" "two standards" "" "measures." ""
There is no doubt about the traditions in Regensburg doubt that there should be "shameful and shameful deeds," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"the habit that the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.
"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischen Rundfunk:" "" "we would like to go on the church and this is a greased fresco." "" "" ""
In addition, she pointed out that in their youth "saw a quite normal educational tool" had been "to be done with cheeked children, as I was one."
They are unfair to turn the standards for past few decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Entirely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who responded with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenant Attorney Ulrich Weber?
"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspau became sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high blood-sensitivity" "" "victims of overprint, 67 dometer and sexually abused." ""
In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, let's hold that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.
At high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could be also severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accusations, many of the victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories will be linked to him. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report for the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspau Georg Ratzinger in his opinion is discharged.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence to Protects" at the Regensburger Domlehammer, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
"" "for one raise many students" "" "humanity" "". "" ""
In addition to others, it also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which has been tangible, when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.
How do you analyze this final report?
Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.
To him, eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion or mitage in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violence at the preschool also occurred outside its efficiency sphere.
It can happen to him, if you want to experience too late or did not take the first suggestion too seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was received from practically all those questioned - literally - "salvation," "heaven," and "better world."
"" "so the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent witness, describing him as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "sinful" "", "as extremely good-minded teachers who supplied them regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" "" "always surrounded by grapes of children." ""
Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high egocionality, which led to wrecking.
That he did not only threw those with chairs and threw the key haults on the floor, but also earmarked with earthly boys and ears, he himself had been deeply regretted and apologized for themselves.
However, it has to be said to have said that such educational methods were widely used in the fraction period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as in teachers.
Do you still know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I have also experienced that in a worldly school, a state of school.
Compared with what is in this report, namely, the dire sexual misuse and the violence at the preschool, this is free bagatels.
One has already wondering if it does not seem to do with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, so many media has just collapsed on him.
On the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him, still eager to be zealous.
But the truth is: the report sent Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In connection with the report, the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse during the Domensburger Domsparrows.
Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also posted any settlement or contributor in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.
No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a covered representative for the others," "" "It was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""
The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.
If they didn't even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then it is certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.
How do we assess the Dominion disciples Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: a questionable student was formulated so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had been right (Georg Ratzinger), and could have had his own perpetrator.
I hold it... also for really absurd, assume that it is just opened... boys obtrusive or clearer, or rather opened up, as compared to their parents, international guide, confidentiality, etc.
That one speaks with him about sex... - thinkable. "
"" "thus the report on the very clear result is:" "" "in the apprentious student and / or their environment, the examination could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""
What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has to be free from every contributory.
So he cannot be charged with him, not prevented, or to be brought to the ad.
Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violence to read" at the Regensburger Domenheim.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "seeing" in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that everything was mixed in the reporting and it was taken to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst, Georg Ratzinger.
But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.
It is set up separately: between the preschool and high school of the Domspau College, between sexualized misuse and violence as well as, we say once, other fixtures.
Furthermore, the report incidents from the time since 1945, i.e., from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domspau.
All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadisticculed teachers were quite similar and malnourished, they all have to be successful at the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous circumstances have to have.
But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boy at his face when they were already at the Domspatzymnasium.
On that, like most witnesses, the subject "Pre-School" taboos.
One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: there is already discipline, but no sadist violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims" the general humanity of R. estimates, and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories will connect with him. "
So, at most, the accusation remains to be looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by states on the preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from his predecessors, at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.
Enclosures Georg Ratzinger ahead of the conditions rigorously the ears?
Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium which the report was even reproduced.
In this regard, he refers to that "that in the preschool, the test sentence will continue to be practiced."
He sees urgent income in view of the danger of negative charges.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was long ago as a test sentences were long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, it occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows of us.
It was difficult for him to estimate where the victims were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the allowable border had been exceeded.
But one can't say, he would have always looked away.
That just doesn't agree.
The test sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980, and officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to approach the standards of contemporary pedagogic standards at the time.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "Fallacck of Anachronism," so the danger that the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess has already right.
But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and not for what was broken in the nursery school and violence against innocent children's boards, which goes far beyond that.
All of this is quite horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be done.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
"" "" "" "its means to disciplines and punishment, i.e. ear-rists and ears, were widely used in the 1970s." ""
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also has strictly adhered to.
What's the image of his Regensburger Zeit, Georg Ratzinger has given you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?
Was the subject of reference to the language also?
Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspans played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I'm not sure that he led a stricter regiment in there.
But this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without which no unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of cattrang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went out twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonbons alone, one accruly makes no big singers but at any success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self overcome.
What a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on your book?
Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faithful and hearty people, from which one can't imagine that he could do something a fly a little bit too.
I get regularly with how many former domites are still today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly about them, are clearly in the minority.
Most domites are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.
And that he always is a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be, but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still have views and honour them today.
And please, once more clearly: all that one accuses to him are educating methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad that we have never overcome this time.
But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and an even more prominent brother to make a spiritual sinuck.
There is the bad intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.
For the report which has just been published, loaded him.
Now the ambulance area, a 93-year-old man, who had acquired a great promise and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps even Germany probably nobody wanted to know the Regensburger Domspau, finally in peace.
