Munich , 1856 : four maps that change your view to the city
an Irish institution , where young people are meeting today .
a se@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel will be dug .
small farmers work the ru@@ sty reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not currently current .
this knows everyone who had to be exciting already because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a rec@@ ti@@ ring road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offering of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the bro@@ ader area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ ent@@ ep@@ atic , which one can not recognize as such .
the great coverage map were set up for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ st@@ ings .
these were developed according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration , between 1810 and 1864 , and of the first survey@@ ing Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second World War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course military purposes .
even if the French troops finally pulled off the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a wide @-@ wide Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration .
the Ur@@ gency Award for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the others found on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison morning / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has extended itself into all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was granted 21 years after drawing up the map , in 1877 , as the district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of the houses are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West park is , you can see nothing but fields - at the first sight : in the Hin@@ ein@@ zo@@ oming , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &apos; Ur@@ bino , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
small par@@ c@@ els do not prove to farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the complex &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green space is characterised by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow - and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
on the contrary , in the area of the present district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen can not only read the street names &quot; at the &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or by the front &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one has once locked people with mad@@ ments .
there was the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ pension at the Au@@ er Lü@@ beck in 1858 / 59 .
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der , headed by the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist , led by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced to his time and ended for example the Cha@@ ins of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients had been first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for building the Kreis@@ ky pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in the hair of 1905 .
there is the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young@@ sters on the former Au@@ er Ward is now going to meet young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with a training course .
to the west is the soccer field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - built in a architec@@ ton@@ ic way to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during WW@@ II during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was named &quot; Head Square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ way was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger lane . &quot;
the Second World War led to the heart of the Second World War .
the allies of the Allies broke out many holes in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages , once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days work on and on 5 April 2017 on the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station .
with the shooting gallery , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Publ@@ ished Travel Guide for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of farms has issued a warning for colored human beings who are travelling due to discrimin@@ ating policy and rac@@ ist attacks by the state of Mis@@ souri .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal state of Mis@@ souri , which is alleged until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ ced , as a number of frag@@ ility , racial presence in the whole state can be noticed and stated here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination , as well as prosec@@ uting minorities of the state , which cause disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate the group to publish the journey , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of the citizens of citizenship that happen to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be stopped because of their skin color , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group of events such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and Death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under un@@ question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state of Mis@@ souri , and was accused of accused of crimes of crime .
the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the General Office of Mis@@ souri , which showed that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff of what might happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be willing to bring along the money money or the relatives , that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ souri recorded 100 hate crimes according to the latest numbers from the FBI , the FBI , which ranks the state in regards to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri Law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had adopted it@@ iner@@ aries for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed , the local prosec@@ uting authorities were committed to rep@@ aid people because of immigration defects , which will contribute to the further expansion of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel maintenance are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence project is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CD@@ U Parliamentary Group Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken a picture on site .
at the rec@@ tory court of the Schwen@@ demann family met representatives of the fishing b@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ subur@@ ban together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann first granted insights into its operation , in which he cultiv@@ ates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young are accommod@@ ated and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ vel .
on the table of the most beautiful , it is entirely regional .
since he also described the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fish@@ bach , it also described the fence project as &quot; elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can &apos;t generate so steep surfaces on der@@ art .
the green space for a lot of work , must be processed using the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been strug@@ gling with the terms and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and use this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leaders promotion . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers should be supported .
one hope that the capacity of the surface could still be pulled out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and to make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 on the electric fence .
the open space area amounts to 40 hectares , which can not be cho@@ osen up to at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was funded by leader , a quarter brought the village of Fish@@ bach .
consequently , the farmers had to invest 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of consec@@ rated .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and vir@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are best foods produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ level of agriculture ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of f@@ ences .
the finish is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is a pr@@ one by the l@@ p@@ r .
in addition , the fence does not have to be volatile ( Hang@@ ing above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the dis@@ armament .
for the fishing b@@ acher electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the open space is equivalent to 35 hectares , with a total cost of more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est mark of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans like each other - as well as each other - the sor@@ row@@ ed fall of Saddam Hussein in the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologist of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN on the proposals of the president to dr@@ astic limitations of the legal migration of the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de by boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have had it , if he had done it .
but he attacked her importance , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to , as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his basis was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta complain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American liberty which lights the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem , which you refer to , was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about contemporary reson@@ ance on the changing words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your waste , your poor , and your necessary masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ ight waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who started to place their words after their death at the base - was very good that they did a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by presenting the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in an un@@ used classical image .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the compound of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change it long from right wing .
the great scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty has no one invite , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is said to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is encountered here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the perception of the perception .
the great phant@@ astic act of Lazarus was to see them as they see from the exhausted , el@@ ly , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips to the de@@ cks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , to see the world from perspective of people , seek refuge and give a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wanted to recognize .
her tor@@ ch shall not shine on the way , but hatred that is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schot@@ ts belonged to the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which kicks off on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special was developed in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that something has to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy in the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ten , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her captain word was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought all of course were magnificent . &quot;
the Commonwealth Silber@@ med@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ ev , who will compete in its fifth world championships for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ts are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , who were met in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance of Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the capitalist capital says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only belonging to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special feature of team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , making it something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the gravel who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to poets .
what my speech as captain affects ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block Cri@@ tics via Facebook : do not work for a public office , if you cannot bear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the Domestic Policy to his political principles .
he stum@@ bled upon criticism , certainly .
but he didn &apos;t make his critics silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , as sheep are led to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on it , to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union sent him so early this week .
the governor of the Governor , dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a strong hand at the leadership of its state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary resources to connect with his voters and playing his ha@@ un@@ less head to chemotherapy on its side .
therefore , blocking of persons who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to as officially , and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s Spre@@ ader Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Governor , argu@@ ing that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of cast or sp@@ amm@@ ers or water filled people who sw@@ aying the whi@@ p online .
the Post talked with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and un@@ prof@@ ane .
the priest ren@@ ounced the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD , was not satisfied , but she asked to hate them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news statement &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same subject takes place , then it will be recognized by some more than a collective collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the Govern@@ ors of the Governor referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment .
it &apos;s a lot more cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors to burn , or to silence demonstr@@ ators , or to silence demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly what is happening in digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ised that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell to Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the first as@@ par@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the period of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers contributed between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter proposed to its leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
people who use p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions .
petitions which have critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents published by the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t make her silence .
freedom of expression , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses belong to our nation &apos;s foundation .
and true guidance , that means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days at home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the final round in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ating , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his praise with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he established this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to def@@ ending a championship first time although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura open since it was taken in the year after I won them from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the rec@@ olle@@ ctions come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who arrived at his 50th birthday in this year , for the European Senior Tour , returns to his home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six spots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking at lung cancer .
scientists from the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) results in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases can be attributed to passi@@ vity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said academic manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved his own study on the 1994 issue .
there were 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household inclu@@ sions prove itself very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; reason@@ ably in time , &quot; says the ladder by Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as in the Underground are much conce@@ aled , which is not in the plans .
the traffic , which returns to the construction work , represents a great problem for the construction of St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and lock@@ out is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the liner bus are entitled to pass .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p Company have been engaged since weeks with working on the bridge .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .

after half an hour the stolen cris@@ y is taken from eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .

it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua New Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1,0@@ 26 elders have to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement used for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .

Papua New province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s death and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but Indonesia is also Indonesia .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed by 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua New electricity resources has an estimated $ 78 billion worth in excess of $ 78 billion .
these wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua New , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military preser@@ ves a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort had paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
pap@@ al recei@@ v@@ ables according to larger autonomy thre@@ aten the golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua New Guinea were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned .
investigations in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe @-@ high land in the 1970 @-@ s were charged with genocide according to the Asia @-@ Convention Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
screws have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring resources from other parts of Indonesia .

the Indonesian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und than Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal injuries in Papua New campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter , 27 of the 29 districts of Papua New Guinea , including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New Zealand changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i for 2014 , with the expec@@ tation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a depth of two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the rock@@ ing children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers came back to their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their ri@@ fle , said victims and witnesses .
then he fired one of the soldiers into the children &apos;s group .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten , that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua New men , women and children gathered for a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to call justice .
they wore crushed hunting grounds and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - in circles continuously and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent to an internal radio command : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; he said Timo E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native guy Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and seek his body to make sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es who carries a name like many Indon@@ esians , who carries TIM@@ E in dark atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers of the Papua New Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson for the Papua New Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came first &apos; to Jak@@ arta in the following day .
in Jay@@ ap@@ ura &apos;s three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i kept a passionate speech in which he had utter@@ ed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and weak@@ ens the historical mis@@ fortune in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that this case will be resolved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Wir@@ anto Security Minister , said that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for settlement of historic human rights violations .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before a long time .
some were in the 90 &quot; s and early 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke at Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E at the 5th of June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he did not establish any plans in Papua New Compl@@ aint mechanism .
instead , all is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which demanded the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were settled in Papua New Guinea , including the P@@ ani@@ ai stock .
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims were contrary to those claims with gri@@ mm@@ ers un@@ belie@@ ver .
&quot; I interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped four of the victims to bury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ers have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police set on the vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a farmer who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , born 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he fis@@ her in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast their officers on officers , which re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian paramil@@ itary police ) began shooting down and sle@@ w a sle@@ w .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured one has been delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the involved officers to take account and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ de for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua New Guinea .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua New Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of the Papua New Guinea by pushing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people arrested in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some diving never again .
among the people in Papua New Zealand is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : above all emer@@ gen@@ cies and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato @-@ potatoes each .
keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest on the local market is sold .
ten pieces of Not@@ a were only 10.000 ind@@ on@@ ese ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua New and the new migrants who have arrived on the Nab@@ ire airport in a larger number since the opening of new flights .
the few jobs , which are in the region , usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua rarely , the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chair@@ woman of P@@ ani@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world from Papua New Guinea .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media are eag@@ erly anticip@@ ating .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Guinea , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Papua New and Western pap@@ ua : Visa Sponsor and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confin@@ ed to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ele and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to examine the &quot; various and widely spread injuries &quot; in Papua New and the P@@ ani@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings .
the same countries have historically been supported by O@@ PM .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r spokes@@ man back to the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to have the evidence for human rights violations . &quot;
people in front of the place want more foreign governments take this to know .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that would also participate in the meeting , but anonymous .
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua New adaptation that they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a common military , is living in poor education and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua New Papua New Guinea , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ fire@@ arm received a last symbolic act of spite : the body of a victim was buried in an grounds opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they might never return to justice , but at least , they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with special head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential doors in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; said a resident who told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) took place the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages from the cl@@ adding , the outdoor clothing to decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his big Davis Cup @-@ cou@@ p at the general meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only allowed to play two par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , skin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact that is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ rate classic stay the traditional score .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the purpose of IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ el@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will continue to work to improve the values .
not only for the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the proposal reached the final in a neutral place .
only compar@@ atively smaller details will be compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the following round .
to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements in training plans etc. will be reli@@ eved and the players will need to complete less un@@ official media sched@@ ules prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ ellers Exp@@ ected items into the plane , finding a survey
an inquiry under air passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ consciously forbidden objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration rep@@ ented , including at least 6 per cent , who guess the plane while they acci@@ dentally forbidden knife or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had already discovered that it was wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather desp@@ ise the rules .
of the respondents agreed that they have tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , which were members of the Generation X .
the most common items that have been deliberately passed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent said to have benef@@ ici@@ ally carried out objects by security check , while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were also confirmed that they were deliberately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it has asked trav@@ ellers in all the country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled s@@ ware by the airport security and how many things had been deliberately done .
it is no surprise that people who wear most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those were the most frequently flying .
however , the company refers to that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uncertain which liquids can carry them away , or how much of it .
so no surprise there is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated items are forbidden liquids .
for a time , people thought that T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ ad@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customer canc@@ ers order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ estimated that part of the client has withdrawn their un@@ binding reservations again .
in addition to the always @-@ triumph@@ ant numbers , Tesla &apos;s boss El@@ on Mus@@ k showed another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time , that the cancell@@ ations made during the new mass market model 3 for the first time .
Mus@@ k was often advertis@@ ed with more than 500.000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in recent months .
now Mus@@ k is a : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders were withdrawn from 6@@ 3,000 years .
critics have always pointed out , that it is only a non @-@ committ@@ al reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1,000 and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; form of reservation &quot; is completely back .
there are currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ committ@@ al reservations made in a telephone conference with analysts at that time .
if the cancellation of so far , around twelve percent of all orders could be encountered , the Tesla boss believes not .
his argument : the challenge to the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is supposed to be combined all models - 500,000 to be a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
if you can order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without larger breaks with maximum occupancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the dis@@ closure of the reservations might be a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t hin@@ der customers , not hin@@ der in dro@@ ves .
EPA Group CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s for execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules for reducing emissions
a day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took its former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of state government agencies compared to transition faster than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
it comes to a time period , which went off on 1 October for States to hold the standards from 2015 to bot@@ tom@@ less o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year to study more time to study the plan , and to avoid dealing with local decisions in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in Oklahoma , before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , who had been a great time for a depend@@ able ad@@ versary for environmental protection rules .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been re@@ designed to block regul@@ ators or del@@ aying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ge regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks .
in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn @-@ turn at o@@ zone standards simply put the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states due to the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administration , the EPA often has not kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited , and waited in an agreement for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who appe@@ aled the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in Regulation by judicial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available complet@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a solid politics and the best available information is based . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress insi@@ sts to a bro@@ ader implementation of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one last month approval draft law will delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet placed in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , announced the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain the stat@@ utory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of EPA - after our law@@ suits - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ y , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil de@@ o@@ zone is created when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere on sunlight .
the det@@ est@@ able smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups , and cause thousands of premature fat@@ alities each year .
representatives of public health and environment proc@@ laim@@ s about P@@ ru@@ ly surprising course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying , how much pressure does it need to get this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must fight against the ide@@ ological clo@@ ister of the Tr@@ ump Government , to join the pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim do not honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see the legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is worshipped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) is promp@@ ted to take permission to build the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could not have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only exists at the border border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area .
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days before due to a change of flood control zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District government in Düsseldorf hasn &apos;t approved , because of a formula .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the missing regulatory requirement is the granted auth@@ orization to be un@@ lawful and therefore also back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the Stad@@ thalle once again decided the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; an auth@@ orization of the District government is still standing .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is the issu@@ ance of auth@@ orization of a approval for the creation of wind energy investments . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re@@ prove the matter .
but they are likely to do , however , that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view on ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the district was not aimed at the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; itself .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four kilometres of wind turbines at a surface area of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is centr@@ alised , were closed to the owners of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be met - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer , Fort@@ ress City Council issued green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich in Aachen and a part in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg , with Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cra@@ b together : woman dies in terrible accident
on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock in the L 333 , there was a terrible noise accident between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn district ) on Friday morning .
a woman was wounded le@@ thal .
two more people were slightly hurt .
the state road remained locked over hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich was covered with her passenger car as part of the accompanying car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and retail@@ er plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover shopping in the city center in September .
the commercial club and city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 @-@ 9 September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping spre@@ e in the city center .
as the chair@@ woman of the Trade Union , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend was to sensi@@ ze customers that offers to offer their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
therefore , a market with regional providers are planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , native companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
furthermore , shops in the city center should invite to &quot; mit@@ ent @-@ sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the action is not just the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point out on the action weekend , so Christian König .
urban administration and commercial club cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
these include new offers as the first &quot; active day &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest and selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to active participation .
the attractive offers for Saturday and the reference to the parking fees this day are part of the concept .
customers will also be re@@ opened to customer potential or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals would have lost the city downtown shopping .
at the end , everyone would have to contribute to bel@@ low the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories throughout the city and associations .
it was done to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y on a network that partly spread in the spring .
S &amp; D MEP Birgit Stre@@ ich , Head of the I@@ HK Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , said that the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day , five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities are participating for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be paid for the appreciation of the local trade and its significance for the common@@ est of our cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under spring leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump translated after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary walls
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to speak openly that he would not pay for a planned border .
the US president appe@@ aled him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . to report , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and swore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an attractive exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States went to take over &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was called by the Government Obama , as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia and shr@@ inks to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside sw@@ ish the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on 22nd July , is only one reproduction .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; almost all in the audience there were very real sigh@@ s .
since 2005 , Ci@@ tiz@@ ers come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - were replaced by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was charged because of the murders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable , that in all these years no one person was arrested , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps with the organization of reproduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Congress of Georgia and a Life of Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
for him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t get to heal and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a beg@@ gar gave a towel about the body of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents registered by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding Coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but none were ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on open @-@ foot for decades , Ci@@ tiz@@ ens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court rendered a decision by the Supreme Court of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she had , not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white farm owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she went away from prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the murders , &quot; includes an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a plot between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not just involved in the kill@@ ings , pro@@ longed evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks was form@@ able to form@@ ulate it still .
&quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost a decade .
their depic@@ tion is illu@@ stra@@ tive , dramatic and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , which many believed that he does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ chen , because we will be confron@@ ted with his hem@@ ility in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot convert any relationship to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to listen to what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest Black - into a room and listening to a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ co for years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story about life , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and ou@@ sted , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I --- he w@@ anders from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a takes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least of all black actors ) into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; he said Gre@@ ene , still si@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- &apos; he &apos; said .
&quot; yes , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only need to hit the hard &apos; R &apos; .
and precisely there is the energy in space , a feeling of cinem@@ at@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy doing this properly , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene will start again .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman dressed in a sack@@ cloth , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads budget Holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
their voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of approximately four dozen people caught sweat , and tears off their eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have experienced hy@@ gi@@ as @-@ pressing humidity for nearly eight hours , if Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grav@@ estone of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you place on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch murders took place , the air feels re@@ compens@@ ated .
if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a little boy , as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a couple of minutes Gre@@ ene the quantity - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x we@@ dge and w@@ ren@@ ched their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit that the C@@ lan@@ t played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner together .
a white couple from Atlanta radi@@ ates a table with a black pair , which they just met with a black pair .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words , which feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you , and those that do what they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is really doing with me is that Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the Police shooting game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks farm holds his table , he is eating and reminiscent of the civil rights .
he said he began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , he who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf has reli@@ ed on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall and a D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes vintage car , in which the Rhine fun@@ nel is pos@@ ing as rock erg@@ ents , or as an alternative , Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels recall Cast@@ or@@ fs lad@@ ders - money , power and gre@@ ed - that attracts attention by his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold ders - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
she se@@ duce Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood Mani@@ er a body in the trunk and give the T@@ ie @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderful giant Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he suggests Siegfried .
later you need to believe in Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience expresses its ensemble with strong applause .
stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who was modest and hands to the Merkel @-@ smokers &apos; hands formal .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat back in le@@ ver leisure wear .
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam was expected with tension .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to be another great sc@@ oring concert in 2013 , five years later , there were five years later , in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was signed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner should be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it was also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunte@@ ering year at several places .
where anywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven , the furniture bridge .
and I have also worked in the open all day at school .
what are your experiences yet ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with you@@ ths , refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so late @-@ employed volunteer .
how does this come from ?
quantity : I made high school .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say successful .
I recognized it for me , that it is something wrong and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked what do you do .
make a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se there , as it can see , as it is on site , in the burning point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social project in the winter semester .
I &apos;ll be able to study dual , probably in the ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social working training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer work ?
quantity : yes , it &apos;s very variable .
it is always moving on where to make its FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very diversi@@ fied in me .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing that prov@@ okes me .
I could see and see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
differently than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well clearly , here is not to calculate st@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has other people in front of them , each of which have another story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a young man from the family has been fet@@ ched out of the family - one must always go on individually .
very interesting .
and they did not have a touch of contact ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a field that gives a lot .
plenty of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life just like that .

according to local reports , according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district , there were also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO , the explosion on Thursday night was to happen as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state are in the US military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so@@ lic@@ ated Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
in late July , a suicide bomb be killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US forces assass@@ inated the Taliban in 2001 .
violence highlights the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , since US President Donald Tr@@ ump sum , the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country .

EPA returns to the delay of tu@@ g rule to cl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to condemn the government &apos;s government regulation , repe@@ ating what the states are obliged to ban the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the pac@@ emaker .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations &quot; in 2015 , and said they show the commitment to the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA , which should be measured in part of the country &apos;s contam@@ in@@ ant emissions , to determine where entries must be made to stop stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump attempts to rep@@ ay a wide range of environmental impacts , who imposed the former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda that would boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have fired the demo@@ cr@@ ats of the Democrats and the nature conservation groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and enhance the respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
municipal law wants a common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two respects , the municipal at Flu@@ id Win@@ ked decides to set up a common room in the future senior facility .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece may be signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
although it is still ongoing , until the date of the church assembly is owned by the community , there is now no planning relief for that of a private investor to the project more .
there is a discussion concerning a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters floor space available .
the administration and the majority of the municipal coun@@ cils are pending , such a common room not as the meeting point only for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just housing , but open to the community .
as an example , the word &quot; Strick@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision will be reconc@@ iled by providing funding for the ongoing budget in the last autumn , through funding options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , T@@ j@@ ades reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision was to indicate that in this regard , no Kn@@ ü@@ ppel will throw away from the legs in this regard , that both saddle - what is le@@ aning on the surrounding grounds - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the tear @-@ height and the construction more economical - that would be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not so easy in the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one is not so wrong with them , and you can now rest in the common room of the window , says : &quot; I &apos;m so hard to do with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ der speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t sub@@ sid@@ y to the property &apos;s property or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface one should not give a supplement , but can get a true , in doubt , is the equivalent of the return .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers proposal to ple@@ ad the decision in accordance with the decision , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ voices at the original program which summar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe this decision , we make a giant leap to close a giant in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes on an increased performance in the first official mandatory field of the season .

hiking in the Har@@ z star
in Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; should be created .
this is the name of the Club Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary way in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; come to meet the information needs of many har@@ es , whose name was .
he Connec@@ ts Nature , Science , Movement and Sport@@ y Performance .
the members want to set up the route along the planned route and inform about stars and star@@ ters .
in a first phase to 2018 the association is planning &quot; well available installations in five to six places &quot; in the upper @-@ har@@ z .
in@@ query to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the tablets are expected to be comple@@ mented by the Internet .
this is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later , the star@@ path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although it is much further away .
also , in which constellation can be viewed a selected star and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , the highest star @-@ observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 .
the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is home to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there come from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
in the university town there have been something similar to the Planet@@ arium Foundation since 2003 , something similar to the planned cluster - the planet route .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to Hain@@ berg and observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ alls with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly in the distance and a standard of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks thus on a sphere of 6.5 mm diameter , while the sun measures approximately 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters at the temperature .
the whole distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light is needed in the sun up to the Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the bar with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fi@@ xation but would take a half year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meeting for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia was to be staged in a coll@@ ision course to st@@ aging the thri@@ lling boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ paved World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Pun@@ ched Lom@@ ach@@ enko , to welcome the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ated champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you going to champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate , noted that a possible way of show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size of order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to switch to light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko then voted .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to make a date for the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , after their lightweight @-@ weight champion in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; this struggle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Garcia and pushed forward to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
when ever they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia was said he would like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may be part of his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think he &apos;ll see the thri@@ lling Champion from River@@ side . &quot; very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Garcia said that the focus would be to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the moment@@ um that builds up for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighter , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four links to T@@ ire plat@@ ters
during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon , four persons were seriously injured .
following the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 a.m. shortly before connecting the market wide , after a ty@@ re @-@ fired power supply .
passenger car drove to the right in the ar@@ rests , where he over@@ threw himself and then lying on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured service , the A7 toward the north was closed for about one hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ wing crossing was then led by the accident place .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , making the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game , And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as did not the two opponent at 2 : 2 to Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thresh@@ ing chain should also be further optimized in the Erz@@ gebirge .
and a gate after a crash , the Fort@@ unas are no longer able to increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one turns into line with Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also gets better to experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the qu@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is one of his cause , &quot; because we are just able to build the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a requirement for us to harmon@@ ize things even better and we do not afford such a lot of mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann appears to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you cannot speak after a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could certainly be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that , his coach would know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start to the season I took only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony had to be broken off in Hei@@ den@@ heim because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they currently stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inside of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests out of the Rhin@@ eland as a slight favorite on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we run them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is stup@@ idity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no crew in the 2nd division , which one must hit from the outs@@ et , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Chef coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 per cent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Institute of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Reg@@ ulations ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
during the asylum process , you should take more precise during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for lack of the correct age of some refugees that were the age of age .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has no@@ zzles 6.@@ 880 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency told that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 instances , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly less than 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly constant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; propose that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det comments the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , at x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee @-@ joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work comprises the ass@@ essing the biological maturity of human beings to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way , is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t be sure we should not do so as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of developing a child as an adult is poor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are doing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of concrete concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very well in the time , it &apos;s super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Road and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , work began at the same time in all three basic needs bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the timet@@ able is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now maintained a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge f@@ lap on Wednesday morning .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as an operating way .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge f@@ lap .
and then the pedestrian walk@@ way shall fail .
the special thing is that there are components , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bri@@ ck@@ caps .
special finger@@ tip feel the laying of pipes through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the works .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building stock and the collecting site in Direc@@ tion Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance , the road is in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bro@@ ods consec@@ u@@ ations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
it &apos;s not so frequently that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , everything else &apos;s difficult to get into a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on that day , because the AF@@ D will be in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to a poster entitled &quot; Big Choice Award . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are already in front of the event will not want to listen to the AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ pic@@ nic was originally planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now you can find on the parking place below the rack - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the decisive organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ ate potato salad , who could eat the AF@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with .
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in particular at the railway station , which is just a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come up on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes are reported by the AF@@ D volcanoes , he will stri@@ ve for such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for the first time in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation because of the already established Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking available .
so , the g@@ ond@@ ell , hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ as Square he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right to the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle different speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ chair Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers waiting for them that the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour take the AF@@ D event , the guests on the pre @-@ place have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I add to grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately dealt with bitter .
despite all , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin as@@ sures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I posted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , there was Kri@@ sten to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or ham@@ pered .
I just didn &apos;t like it to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them suffered her loud &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but during the school time , as they prefer just like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
now I look back and think myself : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t love their love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some call me some and ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify to justify the public domain . &quot;
West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Republic of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced that Thursday evening of a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , announced that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many things ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally erup@@ ted in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump talked about a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice assigned not the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes put a firm that he possesses coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal business by his father .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening was given an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than to work out our country . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 states and the controlling of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice , only the last re@@ jection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , progressive message , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday that he described as an obvious excuse of Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Design Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that was correct , and that he determined to fight d@@ oping .
he said it was sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were s@@ nat@@ ched out of gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) notes on state sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized that it has some very hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia should accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but the Congress supported the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ ceased system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin in the Athle@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
propriet@@ ors are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden train@@ ers are still free , &quot; he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral act for the Sol@@ di@@ ble Sol@@ di@@ ble for Mali
around 1000 people of the two women who were star@@ ed by a stroke helicopter in Mali with a funeral in the North h@@ ess@@ ischer Frit@@ z@@ lar .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
to the un@@ resolved issue , Secretary of Defence , Ursula from the Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
they called the two inver@@ ters &quot; pilots but as &quot; C@@ ould their skilled worker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , called it in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were living in the West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
her sc@@ ents were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead wake of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the families in the Church took leave .
after that , the funeral celebration of the family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , and politics began .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
mar@@ es laid down roses , the members of the arm resi@@ ded in arm in the coff@@ ins .
before the Church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
Secretary of Defence of the Ley@@ en described the en@@ chan@@ ted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ ch@@ atter@@ ed .
the rod @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillar has built the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ents .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent in which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , then nobody would have been mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en , said : the action is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried in his death after his death .
this divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen didn &apos;t agree with the decision of her husband , so it was in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , is still un@@ clear .
but he is not the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
he would have become king to reign after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he retired and puts the title &quot; Acc@@ ept@@ . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not see the title and function that he wanted to see himself as opposed to his wife - also not after the death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief president of the Danish king house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
in his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always imp@@ lied , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year old reg@@ ression with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik was about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis courts instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco , and the call had given the call to be the brand @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for a view .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
that was just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil aims to win new di@@ aling
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
however , the prime minister of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governance for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the start@@ ling of a Green Party members from their country fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the regional election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in Parliament to the Opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green @-@ Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ire justi@@ fies her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
S &amp; D Group president Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ esis will encourage his group to record them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on country , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the ratio was vice versa .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on January 14 .
Th@@ ron@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to rule out in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , keeps it indispensable for the fact that the farm decides to decide its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister , the Prime Minister , draws the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these possibilities should be examined legally , &quot; said Th@@ ron@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ask all the questions , if they are legally aware of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ron@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politicians even stressed : &quot; I am not a representative .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Green Party called on the back@@ sli@@ d MPs to return their land daily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course , of course , that they have received their country list , which has given them over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the national leaders met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s leader of the Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ire extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background , there was no lasting differences , we cannot do this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the State of the State Green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ ire to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only the betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her injured vanity and in their fru@@ stration after the interests of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to propose political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resignation of CD@@ U Parliamentary Group Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ought wants to recommend his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ ire to the CD@@ U .
the German leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the life@@ jack@@ ets , with a personal career giving up the result of the 2013 regional election .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Green in the country , but a fine @-@ thin majority of a voice was held .
agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect us from tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses over contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Home Affairs Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) works in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How does the consumer protect from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers who want to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de make the federal states the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we know currently , is practically excluded from health haz@@ ards .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the purpose of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house is immediately asc@@ ending and has since become acquain@@ ted with the affected area in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trading has the same way to worry about that the sold products are transport and health un@@ think@@ able .
if in eggs of the resi@@ dual level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge , the production plants hits no immediate guilt .
rather , they have to pay due to potentially illegal practices of services with economic damages .
as always there is too little checking in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have revealed the process .
however , the truth also belongs to that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
for this reason , a consistent adv@@ ent of such events and the hand@@ over to the government bar in the cases , in which off@@ ences may be present , of crucial importance .
I have already made several times that I expect from the responsible authorities an error @-@ free statement .
is the regular alarm system necessary for food scales ?
consumer consumers have the right to get safe and secure food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are not ou@@ tra@@ ged .
producers , tra@@ ders and consumers are advised in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
generally , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ tici@@ de Fi@@ bra@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ breeding animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact will be swi@@ ft@@ ly and dist@@ ressed .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing mon@@ stro@@ ked issues of European football matches will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Germain on the UEFA , as the leading organization that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to negoti@@ ate teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair Play rules , which were called by the UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G had to point out sometime that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without a major loss .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can handle the money with safety , so N@@ ey@@ mar supp@@ oses and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich master@@ y family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to purchase a lot of money for acqu@@ iring players , but must act with legitimate income , which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business .
from Michel Plat@@ ini , he was designed for the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that one who had received enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ru@@ ze , if banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P surrendered to the concentration of the clubs on the surveillance of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally used in the Chelsea in 2003 , and then invested a club with potential , and then invested heavily in order to build the team and build a global brand .
while the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of up to 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to make it a bit of excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead , and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA Cup in the previous week , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for billing on the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , allowing for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( 82 million dollars ) , which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members of the 2014 @-@ 15 European Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to exceed their financial supervision by providing their income by companies linked to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could transp@@ onder@@ s the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEFA Cup would not apply as legitimate income .
exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the P@@ act of PSA of the Qatar Tourism Authority is pu@@ ffed up .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come on payments from the 2022 World Cup committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar WM am@@ bass@@ adors will be simply to be able to find out a such man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is still more attentive , trying to observe the rules .
the UEFA has no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , Merchan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ ad@@ sales .
the Association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s . by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financi@@ ally d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the official owner of the PS@@ G .
Arsenal &apos;s manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
in the past years , choc@@ ol@@ ates choc@@ ol@@ ates choc@@ ol@@ ates choc@@ ol@@ ates chocolate for Swiss .
now , the s@@ wis@@ s work in front of a possible end : the airline introduces the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the S@@ DA news agency a corresponding report on the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; by Friday .
according to the current planning , the airline will complete a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed and subjected to quality control every two to three years .
&quot; with the current suppliers Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; around 17 million small &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scra@@ per &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scra@@ per pla@@ ques are distributed over 14 grams per year before landing on passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swiss franc wanted to make any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; North@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the promotional effect : for a sh@@ og@@ gi@@ raffe , it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants there are for the new tender , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Swiss .
only Swiss manufacturers are coming to question .
according to the newspaper article , choc@@ ol@@ ates Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for a position .
chocolate tablets , which have been on board their flights since 2006 on board their flights .
before closing the Swiss contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with choc@@ ol@@ ates Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
the customers of First Class with treats are spo@@ iled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , in the business class n@@ aschen Pass@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y .

and there is still another crazy @-@ evil plot , included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the exit rates are the best part of the franchise .
it &apos;s particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ali@@ sta@@ che of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could bring this franchise as a sort of repeated &quot; Seven Years ! &quot; until he reaches what I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene is showing the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now remembers another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east @-@ west ring road icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created comedy with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as a director to be a gre@@ ased TV series : an Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main cast - a hart Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized English .
it &apos;s a genius idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to look at ( the police for@@ gets the time to watch chess in television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ man - Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays as one .
at six long episodes , it turns away , and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was re@@ dig@@ ged on a less@@ er length , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef will always return to the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can make everything for the age .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with her own younger ones .
impact against drug m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police has a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar County , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office took place on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 accus@@ ations were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already arrest war@@ rants issued against this .
in addition , the officers produced larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros certainly .
two people were arrested at the same Raz@@ cia in Italy .
on the two susp@@ ects Italian , there were German arrest war@@ rants .
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia was accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y .
already in summer 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s office con@@ stance against organised drug dealers in the South German room .
between the Heads of State in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a re@@ active exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ mean Rot@@ tw@@ eil had virtually daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
in particular , the examination of the investigations were primarily Italian nationals with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up in the morning in the morning , is likely to go to the gang of bonds .
manner den@@ ounces large g@@ aps in fore@@ ig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report indicates the fore@@ ig@@ ner regi@@ strations in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions at asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commission@@ er management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has said a media report to great g@@ aps in the country &apos;s central register . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short@@ com@@ ings of the registered data can be found in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; in partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; in an analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , according to the register , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by some 600 exclusion authorities in Germany .
because the data have not been adequ@@ ately maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who are German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ correct data input can significantly slow down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics of statistics of trav@@ ellers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over EU citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regi@@ sters over EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , such mis@@ direc@@ tives led &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with travel agents , &quot; says the analysis in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government has clearly begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy , when they arrived from there .
it covers an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ sti@@ cker Newspaper . &quot;
in the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F welcomes such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to achieve them first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state may send him back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason the office has now been writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have left for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) put these comm@@ itments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
the internal policy spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a companion of childhood . &quot;
second best result achieved
there are a total of 220 liters of blood of the people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach are already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
together with his 100 donations , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood in the meantime .
traditionally , the church was buried in the meeting of the Municipal Council which don@@ ates multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , as our body is laid out and we p@@ ollen the don@@ ors that you provide blood for foreigners , nor un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only blood donation gives several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the county leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because conserv@@ atives are de@@ composed into its components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , maize enb@@ acher told the actions that will be carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circul@@ atory leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theater has led to higher participants a few years ago .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have caused spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain , while interest rates on family income lies in the middle of a intensi@@ fying print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for providing interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members this month , as the weak economic growth has the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual sales report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue , whereas inflation in the fall is likely to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .
but it claims that in the coming years , interest rate would be necessary to bre@@ wing those of the Bre@@ xit , and they said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected to finance the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of Mamm@@ ut &apos;s economy , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will challenge time for the financial plan to provide cheap financial resources for banks even though it was predicted that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the re@@ side of households continues to consume consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy is needed for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent , than the markets expect .
markets also forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank has however stressed that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be made .
the Bank forecast down@@ wards growth forecast for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.@@ 11 .
the decision to no change occurred , after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth numbers have fought rising expectations for interest rate and increase GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to recover at 0.3 % in the third quarter although it will be easily re@@ covering after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ ten is getting worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy will not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent your income before the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages can recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak Po@@ unds which is a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pel@@ vic .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment , the reputation had increased after an interest rate , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July increased an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen down to 2.6 % in June last month , although the Bank has said that this was expected to come again in the coming months .
the Bank said that in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; entirely &quot; to weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ t , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decision of the s@@ wap rate the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking forward to shops and want to end in a positive way .
the market is especially good for those who run the existing De@@ als and exclu@@ de the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) shall drive the controversial of HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September after a battle against financing the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one of the risk of infection with high risk reduction in high risk patients can decrease around 86 percent prior to sexual intercourse , now from health service to a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial , after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed the Supreme Court in the last year , confir@@ ming the N@@ HS , despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
the Chess Federation announced on Thursday announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first who will enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ position@@ ist trop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pr@@ EP has significantly reduced the HIV transmission to Inf@@ ection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications in the body are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken any day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to study the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to have anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a domestic doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply drugs in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence , as it is used in large scale targeted and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to complement and over@@ take HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in preser@@ ving one of humanity &apos;s largest health challenges . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically for needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner to improve many of many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority has to be done so that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the Pr@@ EP test medicine was designed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation .
the evidence show how transformed this drug may be part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people that are HIV @-@ infected , and that we contribute to contribute that we will come closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
life Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their po@@ ckets and sold their bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I was looking for something similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have made me in love with her and made an offer to this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room man@@ or with a w@@ asted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yoghurt storage space and a mezzanine to optim@@ ise the generous appearance height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she instructed the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which one could stand .
Er@@ fan was needed to be creative in order to solve the award .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ st@@ acked , without letting us g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height above or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan , to place two rooms at full height - with much an additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
the embos@@ sed gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirror plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a small corridor mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the tax@@ ing and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineer went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s opposite , so that when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could win an extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; a real estate agents will enter a real estate agents and perform a calculation based on soil size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time , to use high @-@ quality materials that provides space to the space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are things which you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in electrical outlets in walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned through a good design and increased square size of something standard in something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this one .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property empire
two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
along with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 real estate has accumulated a value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the family West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in town @-@ rum , the area areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Colin - by Paul referred to as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family of De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about one @-@ third .
a judicial field indicates that Colin owned its property worth $ 316 million and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposed divisions have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed attempts , the Supreme Court held its first hearing .
brothers now also fight to control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims to have cast it out .
Colin argued that this is not true , but throws Paul before , ad@@ minister some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Colin , he says , he hope to join the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writing that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails , and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ ac@@ ess@@ ences from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin opened the first je@@ ans@@ ing family .
Colin says he began to see West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis company Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million while leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million .
both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took care of Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to complain about our family names , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he was still looking forward to a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps has plans to limit new Chief of Staff to limit the Presi@@ dency of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly will actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
poli@@ tico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with senior employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that have entered the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly said that information about him should flow through - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would take better decisions when he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense but others have attempted to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump , by monitoring its medical device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back decades - and now where he is at the White House , his TV advertisement is still strong .
&quot; when the candidate was off@@ ended , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February versus POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Poli@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it is taking control , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a pri@@ cel@@ ess praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &apos; was under control , is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets have no more spark plug without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t broadcast .
if his staff had made it a few times , trouble away from it , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Materials , which may promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ing the pre@@ ference for the pre@@ ference for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials said that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press prints , especially those with sham@@ eful lung che@@ ques , and that it turns out to figure out where these come from .
just that happened at the end of February , when someone sent a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of being &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been banned from Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence or that he expressed in@@ correct pre@@ aches in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still stri@@ ve to influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ abl@@ ished criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped for .
the police in all Europe sends back to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
as the addresses of selected heavy criminals are not known , indications from the population will be hoping and to pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences have shown that many volatile to travel destinations hide , it was called by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online search engines could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them because of execution on the website .
trav@@ ellers take action on a dit@@ ch and return back to &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some tough trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , who have tra@@ ded one from the church drawn gra@@ bs to with@@ stand a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies , and a army of tran@@ sports , after they were cast out in May , but had been deported from the grave , but had been deported from the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
ra@@ ging inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are moved on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley Heath , where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced through shame to implement in fact , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers in May there were further moved and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , and probably more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to circum@@ vent how you keep long breaks to protect their parks .
I &apos;m not happy at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to keep my shared share when the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a resident who could not be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of those travelers to be lo@@ oted only by another round .
the figures have increased this time and we even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an uns@@ crew camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to make it fast as possible .
to support our support collection , it is very important that as many people have reported a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we propose our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then ambi@@ ence of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also paid revenues by the local tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , given a dramatic increase in figures of refugees that came to the county , the hotel &apos;s office building offered as a collective accommodation offered for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by placing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not controversial at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bürger@@ meister Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ending the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interested parties at the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will return it to a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
you will be called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a container container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
floors were demol@@ ished , blank@@ ets are partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to be done until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large furnished showers , the input area is designed , new windows are installed .
everything should become &quot; beautiful bourgeois close &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself .
&quot; we want to make a je@@ wel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it is not to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on a higher city center level , highlights Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , looks broad , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both single holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he already led to the Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city be covered with the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly .
just under a million Euro , he reck@@ ons .
the external services are also brought to front of front , this is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace which is open from the restaurant that is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. special agent sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is alleged to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
the panel has taken up work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation of the people familiar .
the newspaper recorded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that there is already the first pre@@ charging of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have been engaged in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps elec@@ trop@@ hy and Moscow .
the investigations are aimed at investig@@ ating several men who acted in the election campaign as advisor of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also adopted more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post wrote a couple of weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally got into the centre and check the accus@@ ation if the president possibly has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , to examine and decide , to examine and decide whether he should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Prosecutor .
they are mostly switched on , if there are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to turn persons to the interro@@ g@@ ation under oath .
according to the broad@@ caster , CNN were already shown to meet the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were promp@@ ted by a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the inser@@ tion show that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be needed to act quickly .
however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end in order to decide about the arrest of an indictment .
nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president took an address in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
his special advis@@ ors T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion that he does not know anything about the creation of a Grand Jury .
this , however , usually work in the o@@ bedience , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ aire &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in it , its name was further explained in the declaration .
Mu@@ eller was not first used after Tr@@ ump had fired com@@ ey .
because of this ra@@ mp , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become noisy , he wanted to hin@@ der justice .
Com@@ ey said in June prior to a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to have asked for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large pressure because of the investigation .
after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this led spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be dismissed .
unlike an independent special agent of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair with Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has received a position in which he could be fired at the presidency of the President of Justice of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators were ordered by the legislative elections on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg casts in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the west @-@ Antar@@ c@@ tica a gigantic ice@@ berg has replaced the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the weighing over a trillion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 sq km big col@@ oss are now moved to the north and will probably take two or three years until he is melted .
it is equipped with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ic@@ c@@ aries who have registered researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people .
when climate change played a role during the crash of the iron , research is un@@ clear according to research .
however , the US research center for snow and ice cream has been held in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers , it can be related to global warming .
the col@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s .
the bowls swim on the sea and is pe@@ aked by large gl@@ aciers .
it always grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of wa@@ xes and dis@@ rup@@ tions several years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes in a complete shame , writes A@@ WI .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shr@@ inking is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and could fall , if at a key point a piece of breaking .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , because they swim in the water and p@@ ushes the ice so much water as it gives the melting itself .
however , the loss of the shr@@ ine is that the gl@@ aciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small measures , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is the fourth largest in the Antar@@ c@@ tica for almost 50 000 square kilometres .
the front of the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural creature and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists is controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s will come back again , and possibly close together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , added , added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researcher will not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ice@@ berg not to climate change , so in the past decades , many ice caps of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are torn apart .
this long skir@@ ts of Antar@@ c@@ tica is located towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and counter to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants ho@@ ists at the personnel
because it is increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ancies , the CD@@ U calls out from the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the chal@@ k went through 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind him .
the teachers in circles are obviously very desired .
some 620 applications for this year were to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing , in order to overcome the increasing requirements and tasks .
currently there are in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann according to the 50 @-@ occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative in the C@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and join the field of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the parties of the parties , &quot; a concept of recru@@ iting and personnel development is expected to work . &quot;
it is , not only short @-@ term demand to cover specialists , but future @-@ oriented application to apply , it is called .
the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , demonstr@@ ating concrete action for cross @-@ starting instruments and include an educational offensive , challenge CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one would not know earlier .
other cities recru@@ its good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , there is a high number of employees , the disease or age caused by the service .
so the greatest time to act , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party yet through the joint application .
he had long ago already in the chal@@ k for a f@@ rank surprise when he asked the recruitment of personnel in public and the other parties o@@ cked .
people want to check all possibilities that allow for an exit from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also stri@@ ve in cooperation with the affiliated towns - a ho@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials to pay better than it actually sees the tariff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , increases or more money , only if one changes in a higher level , which is orient@@ ated to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are growing steadily over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Council Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fies the sound to NGO &apos;s mig@@ rant life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has committed NGOs working for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue to continue their new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , because their crew collabor@@ ated effectively with traff@@ icking in a way that facil@@ itated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been operating since one year , refused to express itself to a comprehensive pron@@ oun@@ cement of the Italian citizen Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us and remains the rescue of human life our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all the claims that are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities have supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , and since October .
it is assumed that its crew accum@@ ulates on board ships that are delivered directly from human hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to be only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the nationality , whose contents of Italian media was published .
the occupation is susp@@ ects , on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of code you need to have boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , especially an Italian police officers , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have previously declared to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential amend@@ ments or disability &quot; to their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who came after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guard and co @-@ operation with the local civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali concerning measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and land@@ marks .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ - and W@@ einf@@ all from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ epi@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed View@@ points , partly on door@@ men , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the fore @-@ bearing levels .
in between the long time there were longer breaks , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
the look@@ out spot to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate An@@ sti@@ ege .
on the last two days , many al@@ timeter were told again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shopping h@@ uts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers started in the open @-@ air content of healing Sole .

after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga prepar@@ es for e @-@ sport
what are the sport stars in future in front of computer kon@@ es , rather than swe@@ ating at wind and weather through the stadium to fight ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages inclusive .
this also recognized the first federal government , increasingly to engage in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg later followed the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some failure to rise on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the next weekend the FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the Gam@@ er of various clubs will compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has since become an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs attempted to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian .
with celeb@@ r@@ ity e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be more often present in these markets than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ um to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
in the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA at competitive level .
they have long ago , as in the normal sport , lights established , in which the pros will compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sports ?
for many is the performance of ordinary needs .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ o has long been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical responses show , which you can also find in classic sport , for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it need cog@@ nitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ o also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is getting more a theme . &quot;
controls are hard @-@ scre@@ ened at online @-@ games , and in the scene failed the structures of classical Sports .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high @-@ inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international on the road , that &apos;s like a great global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirt .
a study by the management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ sport .
thus , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship , and big tournaments .
in three years the turnover is expected to lie at 130 million .
the football Bundesliga was almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; writing the Del@@ o@@ itte advisor .
International are many countries .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher invested in the e@@ Sport competition in Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as lessons , he says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer @-@ first League @-@ associations have been committed to the br@@ is , an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ f@@ B @-@ Managing Director R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times are to clari@@ fy , it is no longer enough .
it is therefore to maintain the tradition of the association , but to al@@ ign the company at the same time .
&quot; we live in an digi@@ tised world , &quot; also de@@ br@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t hold on it , that only when football remains so , as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both they had suffered a psych@@ otic disease as well as Mr Roy .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream colour@@ fully , Carter stood with tears in eyes , folded hands and down @-@ facing eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the lawyer to the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said it was a terrible circum@@ stance , which they utterly regret . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad was a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it was &quot; no day , in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me , and as I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity with us , for his sisters to be there .
Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; persecuted by the realization &quot; that she would never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more to have this only person I &apos;ve been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legitimate preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal @-@ oxid@@ ant pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case also drew national attention , after Car@@ ters pron@@ unci@@ ation claims that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go on , spring from a building , start yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she sent in two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide they wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What@@ ever you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that they would benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few who have defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 because of murder on their British fellow country@@ men in Italy , was acquitted of two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 Years old , published a comment by the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me allowed me to run as captain in the Audi Cup , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern wins the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a great season - extra motivation was not available .
anything else was there in his place in the cabin , which looked at Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional clothes was very small , very small .
but as far and broad on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was no Philipp L@@ ending and no Manuel New Year , he made his bar@@ k to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment to Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach was Kim@@ me .
not the eight @-@ year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born in the youth game , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from the holiday home professionals existing C @-@ el@@ f as a game leader , but he .
sugar is distributed as a gift to those , to which one will give much to them that you want to keep in a mood .
who , therefore , became selected to compete for the inheritance of L@@ ame , can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what one would like to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old died as mini @-@ lame on the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white B@@ ind on the arm did its rest .
and even at all , Kim@@ me worked in this position as the one that can take the rod the best in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal wants to over@@ ride his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , to get out to the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ks also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver joins in their first appearance at the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t in their first appearance .
it worked out quite well .
Sü@@ ver next to Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the defense of the army , ran in su@@ pre@@ m@@ ingly confident .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , moreover , Sü@@ ver tried to make a couple of times in the play @-@ building .
his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result &quot; was not the way we hoped it was . &quot;
but he also showed a decent achievement in the debut .
playing time , temp@@ o changes : &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot;
as un@@ used to Bavaria @-@ Welt in addition to the new@@ com@@ ings , you saw it in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me retired after some cris@@ p statement in his back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ ver a interesting phrase : &quot; what is going on here I have noticed now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he must not teach the new one more .

company content with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : Economics , Respon@@ ing Tempo
it often proved in@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was an economic minister of Rheinland @-@ Pfalz .
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ inquiry by a change in the economic policy - and add the old minister at the same time .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has blocked forever . &quot;
Nat@@ us &apos;s biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the direction of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is in the priority list of the country now above .
even this year , the Ministry for a planning procedure , until 2021 is expected to be the construction law .
Trier , too , plays a role in the plans of the country , also in the pre@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive need of the Federal Constitutional Court .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister of Foreign Affairs , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us looks at a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the industrial and industry ( I@@ HK ) of Trier is as a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
moreover , I have an open ear for people who want to establish a own company , praise I@@ HK .
the craft of Trier , in the new Master @-@ Bonus , sees an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the completed master examination and 2500 Euros , when graduates now made self @-@ employment within ten years .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the proposed road construction will quickly create facts at the same time , at the same time , there is the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive director of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to take the Wis@@ sing at the state operation , so far 29 places are occupied .
the I@@ HK demands to give more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf dis@@ points on calculations of the host of host , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the order of national roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the lack of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broadband construction in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a score of 3.4 .

Audi will change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - auto producer confron@@ ts itself with a counter@@ real reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ Chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving limits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based , to prohi@@ bit or limit the diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ its diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install the neutr@@ alisation of vehicles of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also take too what makes it difficult to competitive the price of cars .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to dis@@ covers the mighty auto companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the failure of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age devices that regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be made in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities were accused of being a system installed to deal with the emission provisions in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could make Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer has disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately propor@@ tionally to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ ill@@ less Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter of the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at the time of one of the most widely published Carto@@ on @-@ Dra@@ fts@@ man , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ines of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ists still records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself among others as a sign for congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated by him .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris led him the end of the &apos; 60s breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again , the artists were inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures were cav@@ orting in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he is also sitting still at the drawing , working daily for nearly ten hours .
about cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches find his threatening figures show much spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - a dil@@ los of any animal in his drawings - which has a mill@@ ennium as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which should come to the kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he sets rather onto the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is power@@ less produced .
Lav@@ en@@ del : threatened by the climate of climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lavender is due to the conditions transmitted to drought conditions and due to the illnesses that are transmitted to diseases , scientists and farmers attemp@@ ting to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of lavender .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , which we@@ ars the Zwerg@@ zi@@ pped , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lavender oil lo@@ oses not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long crop pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration made out of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and imp@@ ending drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what safer to feel : they are supposed to take their children with the office that were the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 or at home .
safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : ad@@ versary , Neut@@ r@@ ale , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals , which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break of violence , while in all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are more journalists at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto gave up his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter you find the editor and its ir@@ ir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , Co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt , though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his Central finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ elling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though a special position was built in 2010 , to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the committee , it has led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with the most thousands of murders , which are associated with drug dealers and organic crimes each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers are only rarely issued by journalists .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still consist of treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , although the terrain is now still dig@@ itali@@ zed .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we missed all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s office in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s capital .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was shot from two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the &quot; T@@ wel@@ d River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to move freely around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as riv@@ eting fra@@ ctions are fighting it to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of wounded , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug @-@ trees that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tranquility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , there was the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a rival anti@@ trust in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may have off@@ ended the sons , presum@@ ed ga@@ it bought every copy of the output when it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to force the same story after the sei@@ z@@ ure of a different newspaper , which had the same history to leave the country in its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s founding member and sold 50 U.S. dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without viol@@ ating the ra@@ cot@@ ta problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the newspaper has served as a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took part .
rep@@ orters loved it , hard to publish studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Mary @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , wherever they led them .
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to live more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you must take the task of taking part in a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done before so many ? why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could curse like a harbour worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ proof and self @-@ maintenance .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
when it does wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be du@@ ped ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ g@@ ings , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were entrusted by the state government to protect the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s offices in a four @-@ class building of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in j@@ est , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called Governor themselves as not trusted .
it has been months since the rep@@ orters went into the mountain country , where drug bound de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has captured on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Chavez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ position on the spending , focusing on the hom@@ etown of the Governor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the State Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped , or as it happened , so caution was enjo@@ ined when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of highly har@@ vest@@ ing cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ es a military incident .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez , considered the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something that they never expected , activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orters Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ ap a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ver@@ ge disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is its own .
journalists have become more loud in the country by organizing the SOS Press &quot; protests in organised protests and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pion@@ ate journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth .
she has asked since then , that she is divided by the government because she is worried that her anger viol@@ ated its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists enter@@ tained in Mexico of organised crime , involved in government officials and a equality of equality . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters did not only be killed by drug bound , but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were organised with organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you &apos;ll die because you want to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the murders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody remembers the death of the B@@ log@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .

dinosau@@ rs used camoufl@@ age to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if there is a terri@@ fying .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his p@@ inn@@ ed skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; un@@ fruitful past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the preserved dinosau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well toler@@ ant condition has expl@@ aining it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Radio when he was at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that appeared from the surrounding rock failed on the place , and decided to look closely .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 Po@@ unds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the ready result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have just blind with eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main gate Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , though it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a wall , probably threatened by meat @-@ e@@ aters dinosau@@ rs .
the strong mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white camoufl@@ age to hide in front of pre@@ dat@@ ory , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique that is known as a counter@@ cre@@ mation , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed better to inter@@ fere in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier came from the headlines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli is named after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
it enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the con@@ spir@@ ators , a widespread defense method in animal life , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the conv@@ ection is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising , as the size of bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the animals of today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure by the carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation was favourable as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that dep@@ loy the consol@@ ation - think about deer , zeb@@ ras , or gir@@ d@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier had been exposed to a true struggle .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavi@@ ours on a massive , highly contam@@ inated dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs ro@@ b have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was red .
scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including his preserved Dar@@ min@@ tes to find out what it eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , ran into a river and driven into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ ving skin , but also has been preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just need a little with the eyes , you could almost believe he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , had gone through the earth .
although the King of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11@@ ,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was so@@ aked after death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Radio when he was at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the preserved dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to th@@ igh .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es , which was ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ ater was dri@@ lled through the Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the re@@ mn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the Hau@@ tre@@ k still cover up pri@@ ck@@ les panels along the dinosau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ to .
the more I know it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
the remaining remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ des anti @-@ tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread out .
I can count the scales at its sole . &apos;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday night at the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage coll@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilometres @-@ long bar and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the afternoon of Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm , almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , altern@@ ating .
regarding the exact number of injured parties no data updated .
it was about mild to moderate injuries , said a police pre@@ acher .
an enormous array of life vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ drop in Munich was formed in the direction of Munich .
as a AZ reporter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ way to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ated the markings of the vehicle manufacturers , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident happened at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transport and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing else sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor , w@@ akes an unclean , or tak@@ eth up the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ ers the created ticket control .
it &apos;s simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken his place , and thus al@@ u@@ stom@@ ed the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket ranking without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to be able to use , however , some conditions have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do .
it also has to be bought through the app by rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : you asc@@ end to the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My tickets &quot; .
in the test customers , a button on the electronic survey is released .
the pull leaders get a message to their mobile devices that the g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat seat .
comes the train conductor of the ticket control at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ official online ticket .
so you can still go on to sleep , keep silent , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our train companion , check out the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train &apos;s personal journey , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB correspondence .
second @-@ plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter into individual customer needs . &quot;
those who travel often , knows that in addition to delay and pas@@ sions the ticket controls are one of the biggest medical products .
because often one does not have any documents in any case , but it does not need any documents you need for the application of online tickets .
either missing the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be shown .
the result is endless discussions between draw@@ backs and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the ab@@ yss or large space and del@@ ays in the control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core .
just one day after it arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post of somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted on their feedback , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly on its tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was there , death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thought about himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
they put their cell phone to buy twe@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people , who cried out , and from a man who claimed that Brow@@ ns to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed at which a polic@@ eman was faced with prot@@ esters in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators .
in another video , she said , secured a different polic@@ eman and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... Pets all kill you . &quot;
&quot; it is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembers their testimony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to call ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she won her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas down from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people who live in community life and have filled the streets to ask answers .
as fer@@ rell with her daughter , which carried a flower @-@ dress , and a perfect crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , making them both a conversation , which they had numerous times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered that which she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go now to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy , and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and up .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her a experience , in which they personally do not experience ec@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to keep them far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ al Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson waited .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business@@ owner who made lunch .
they made bags before and helped to pass on prot@@ esters .
slowly started a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after the 9th of August , she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived in an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ mers wanted to only document what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell &apos;s sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area responsible for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct @-@ Ins@@ ular occup@@ ants .
his commitment was closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns shot .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as those people are portra@@ yed , because I will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s experience - to show that it is &quot; not a Messiah guide , but in order to act a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an , and proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls lives , as she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the realization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the murder of the black teenage Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify itself as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting with different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; in which , based on its identity as the heart of the film was chosen .
&quot; she was the person who shook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front of the front , because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the racial relations between the church and the police have continued to exist .
he is based on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ung to singing and she feels committed to this memory , since she walked in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dreams &quot; to &quot; meg@@ a@@ ahn &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the southern edge of the pedestrian street has been spl@@ its in support for the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly can be cold .
the topic also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one at the Bit Gallery said : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ alls ) or simply simply : &quot; size ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , as well as the other business benefits , fear the ad@@ versaries , that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market stands in the 13 direct marketing products .
construction work will conclude with the start of the construction work .
the gallery m@@ acher want to integrate a market place in the new building - in fact for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the Pe@@ as@@ antry thalle for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ i@@ dens always loves again .
the but@@ cher shop also discovered us .
we would wish that , during and , especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there are also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether the direct market in a market hall is located in the gallery , get to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping is in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ink@@ e- or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough in our city .
one can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since it &apos;s not even a regular weekly market , it is more important that at least the market hall should be preserved .
after all , the goods offered at the service is fresh , mostly offered by the producer and is extremely clean .
as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping center only by bigger firms , because the local an@@ ets are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special business are almost no longer and that which is still left , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market stands doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit in Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market place during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the Bit Gallery is actually coming .
or does it make the gh@@ o@@ sts bit @-@ Gallery to drive all businesses from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs no one .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant hall , yes , thanks to the sin@@ c@@ ere many - how I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the farmers markets are broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible , the similar to cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg made of che@@ eks @-@ tu@@ ps and hair cuts that were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from prison in Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analytical minister served a 35 @-@ year sentence after it publicly made diplomatic messages about the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was founded in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that might be extracted from Mann@@ ing and out of the 30 portraits , such as someone could not only look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations , but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , born as Bradley , was born in 2013 , but has already been talking about the identification as a woman , has been sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde seduc@@ es - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came on from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ars pumps and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sentenced to un@@ equal spectac@@ les over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Comic &quot; Supp@@ orters Images , &quot; which would like to predi@@ ct the future in which the President Chel@@ ating would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually only had a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings would call for release seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison , was a welcome kind of happy comm@@ unions .
there is also an exhibition at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and towards trans@@ gender troops to find out new , twe@@ ez@@ ers , which he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called upon Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic fatigue , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a mill@@ ennium release of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped that the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific icon of the artist ) show how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hopefully will take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and like openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell you so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition located in an own room is one page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she emerged with a free spins in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States , as King of Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so don &apos;t stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight out of a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted to look forward in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed into the center of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , with which their genetic h@@ ap@@ pers were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , who formed in Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide man hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who was found as susp@@ ects , after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants were issued due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as announced at Cook &apos;s District Court .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found victims of several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police is active according to the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University in 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , Vice President of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now being ur@@ ned and excluded from the entrance of North@@ western University &apos;s campus .
&quot; this is now a criminal affair that is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operated with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ es .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the University and the Sil@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help U.S. investigation authorities in any memorable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ rens colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a vision of her residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help us find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received a mysterious tip that happened in the apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident happened on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ schedule has been updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA program to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ creation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and published recently on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could be concerned for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot;
however , one of the criteria reported in the list referred to as the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to the alleged state sponsored d@@ oping in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has encountered a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os voted to agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report of controversial positions and regulations may contain .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the implementation of d@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs yet
they shared the company groups .
it is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed for any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was reported in the message .
from now , only eggs are delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative for fi@@ xation @-@ containing anti @-@ ey@@ ec@@ tives .
Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure your staff good luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ age , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ rett , who operates 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it allows companies to address surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite management and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the pursu@@ it of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap P@@ olls and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows a look at a glance which show Units the Most Complaints and which managers are low @-@ approved results - so that you can drill out why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in sc@@ and@@ als that an ex @-@ post office has been published since then a former employee describes a blog post , where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance @-@ industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ t , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year , am@@ id@@ st the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ t has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Company makes custom @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; P@@ olls send confi@@ dential responses in real time and watch the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive board is involved , complaints are to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ t .
if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences due to consumers &apos; boy@@ cott , workers of flu@@ ori@@ ation and cl@@ er@@ ings , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has hired Conver@@ t for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and a simple way to achieve its headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email to the company headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
now since the company is converting the Conver@@ t , problems that were previously identified by executives that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or irregular tra@@ inees were identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disp@@ utes . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke up with the Enron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right &quot; that businesses realized that they could not prevent their dirty clothes online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people use hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors , which both supports start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ t received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing the entire capital raised to $ 47 million .
only $ 10 million in November from Bess@@ emer venture partner and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff expect more jobs than ever before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want the feeling that you accept and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ dit@@ ch , when their portfolio company run well . companies run smoothly when employees are involved and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools promise third promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder you will find support .
the data on employees of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees to your feedback , it can have expect@@ ancy that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can motiv@@ ate dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ating employees .
&quot; if you have to ask 4,000 suggestions , you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to be very keen on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys now , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so er@@ rett .
and after the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees it was due to the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organis@@ ing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
on Ruby Tuesday the company will always get new insights over employees , and it hopes for a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector , which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will also lose our customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose business .
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
at 23 o &apos;clock there is a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football player on one side of the new exercise fields on the campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ cot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ till minutes do a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real wa@@ iter mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the player , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 should start to meet the already completed time plans for players .
the compromise on the two days is more than a day , where Bru@@ ins moved the beginnings of the camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to have 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he will support the rules change of N@@ CAA , even if they add the much employment routes of the player another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they just pressed through , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the Camp is finished , what has been over@@ thrown in view of the clear sight of its fields , adjacent to the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the higher class , which will already be equipped with foot balls , which will be a protective net behind a Tor@@ p@@ fo@@ b space .
Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far too fet@@ ched to think that the people there rent a room and then set it up to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video clip of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best thing we have .
therefore I am not worried too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit messages to third parties and their results at the original contribution then , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize the possible counterfeit software and to send them on fac@@ t@@ apping , the possibly results of the fact review from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main focus points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of which believe that they also have influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has become subject to a major political topic in Europe , with the French voters being flooded during the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany does not support a plan to eliminate the social media networks , as before the election there will be swi@@ ft fast as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts review .
&quot; in addition to the realization that stories of fac@@ ebook @-@ checked third parties want to focus on profound decisions concerning what they read and share , &quot; said Sara , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
it added that Facebook must continue to test its feature &quot; in conjunction with the article , &quot; and in other changes to his news feedback , to reduce wrong news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a can@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy headquarters in the Consci@@ ous River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful on the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ anna May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only wrote on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double female in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time they lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as it would be there even though .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who was beaten with old papers that he will be supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mounted hy@@ ena heads on walls and bottles which had spent centuries in tren@@ ches .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ scap@@ ing , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access to 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the loft . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what they possessed : &quot; one could mean that land con@@ fol@@ lic@@ te would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view a wider basis into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse dating back to 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rhodes .
&quot; the peas@@ antry started in this field and I thought , an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ ers that the family Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell portra@@ yed out of the 18th century , which filled his own funeral ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was dug up ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rhodes &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men seemed to be the right g@@ aun@@ er to make debts and spend money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men put their deb@@ tors to marry their old women - I introduce them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experience
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness of a comic novel about El@@ ong@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ called again by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like me , &quot; Oh , now I have to get back with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : covered over 300 years old Mari@@ an &apos;s chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) do not really think , &quot; write them on their last un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that much better is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we considered as bad honey@@ bee citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
in action there is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount allows the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to re @-@ use their new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the Army
every year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) will be adjusted for retirement and transport .
so also this week .
on the first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session was held no longer in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
among the consultations , under the presidency of the government , the five vice @-@ premier@@ es as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part .
so the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
Deputy Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed Cou@@ p has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers since the failed coup .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan as a wire p@@ addle .
around 4@@ 86 people , which were directly involved in the coup attempt , is negotiated by Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is the army really in grip ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ certainty in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff , there are Bes@@ or@@ g@@ ations for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest themselves in the lifting of the case for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ wing unit in the army and security forces still goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 stat@@ aters , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
in doing so , it seemed as Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als were formerly known as the real masters of the country .
three times , they ruled their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan sailed the power of the military by step , not least under vocation to reform the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is conducting an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; magazine , a well @-@ known officer , who was seeking refuge in the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and o@@ af@@ ists in a few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does this affect the Nato could not be cold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ge of doubts about the willingness to serve the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say .
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he looks to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for the approval of Visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States to change the way as the citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will meet the candidates who are English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge of our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to travel route to the shuttle bus
again , over the past few months , the future of the racing drivers had been fought - now it is supposed to be very fast .
even before the end of the year the tourist railroad , on which the travel route is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing drivers in the long term , according to the public transport service , the construction work will begin in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue and order the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ racing sti@@ ff@@ les , and conf@@ esses the country in particular for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Transport State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum exceeds 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will now be final , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and South @-@ ür@@ ingen Rail as the operator agree on the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map , the vehicles used for vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that would be regular to be ordered for the race @-@ pav@@ ement shuttle on December 2017 .
the speed@@ way shuttle is an especially popular rail connection between the train stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it was tested in the course of a pilot project , whether the distance of sufficiently many people is used to order them regularly in the future .
the circuit is also heavily b@@ lown up in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can not be re@@ united in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robot .
yes , actually .
sex robot is currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people are making fun , but the companies provide a lot of them , and we will see them more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ffs have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lica that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can modify his robot in accordance with his beliefs &quot; and thereby select everything from the eye color of the robot about the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a si@@ lica .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible for example their users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as for instance .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Robot developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ap@@ y and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the True Comp@@ an@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its m@@ oods throughout the day - just like real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ ris@@ ome aspects on this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ lying female properties that goes to rape if one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah is concerned , dis@@ comfort one at most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the site .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasingly refin@@ ement refer to something dark and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire to having sex with under@@ p@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men are of course not holding sex robots , and while the FR@@ R remembers their rising popularity , they still remain in the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ ened out of the boundary zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive until they have given the free market to them .
however , there is a certain sur@@ ge that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time that the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a pre@@ sidents in the White House so that it has become sexually ass@@ orted to have women sexually attacked .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the en@@ closures and out@@ si@@ dered eyes , but how realistic this vision is effective .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this won &apos;t feel like a big jump .
the target behind these sex robots is to have a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builder , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point , when it comes to &quot; Person@@ alities , &quot; the robots do not constitute real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing that might distur@@ b on independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation .
in other words , they are counterfeit slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 language : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ ness of Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voters , also have families split into small size .
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relatives .
we all reportedly ple@@ dged to take advantage of our filter bubbles .
the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es , has been less noticed .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has lived for a long time with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
they re@@ minded me that the unity of a joint enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including Republican relationship , with whom they fought for decades of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context , that this also brings significant risks .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting impact of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ epy possibility that his m@@ itt@@ ens will not be dischar@@ ged by one day .
however , there is a still afraid of long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of ver@@ on@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s kom@@ peti@@ tive version of crazy ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur in a very mild stra@@ pping .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy to qualify as a measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music convey@@ s this in strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are becoming old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not yet over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , because here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time .
if I had to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody was asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before using my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same thing plus the option to reduce the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow exchange of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , which is not required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zed , while I tired the experience , to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Sch@@ circumcised in his craft , which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after a appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ el@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , by firing them several times by a door of the toilet paper in his house in Pret@@ oria , on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell which they say they are to be sp@@ inning .
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority reported that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger Schools the quad@@ ri@@ cular plants from F@@ ewer and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released for vac@@ ations and school@@ ing schools .
three of the dismissed students will continue to high school , four at the secondary school .
head of Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental community in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes selected under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ les which grows in the hen , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower sh@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold took a strange egg , and left it from his chickens .
instead of a chicken sh@@ ud@@ der came out a little eag@@ les .
but the hope of making a chicken , the eag@@ les beat on a high mountain its wings , and broke out .
afterwards the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , which wore cylinders to the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young was different than the other young ones ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish every fourth @-@ wat@@ ery that he feels in his new school .
it followed thanks to the colleagues , the previous school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who jumps over again with material strains , and the parents .
the cooking time is now over , declared class@@ mate Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their school after two years of instruction only very much , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the square @-@ wat@@ ery .
finally , all students would sound a song of summer time and holiday time .
he broke out great joy in the children .
eight winners are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested on Il@@ legal Camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , she was released , while the examination was underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians was later released .
the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied control of the free camp , and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not for this purpose .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the affected now need to know
how precisely is the software update instead ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission @-@ behavior of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin at the ACE car Club Europe gives an ass@@ essments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles which have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ armament is arranged by the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers announced a long @-@ day implementation in the coming months , but also called no exact date .
Daimler is communic@@ ated to write every person affected .
if anyway , if it is an inspection , it will be done in their framework .
how long will the upgra@@ des arise ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin says .
the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer , as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen that voluntary actors do not act on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be , to get an appointment .
what makes drivers who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE will wait for wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would draw , so s@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
is a massive rise of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE doesn &apos;t fear that .
but in the regions where drivers are threatening .
in the rural area , there are no losses for older diesel .
the ACE will advis@@ es you to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize was given to President Tr@@ ump to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted International Kennedy Center .
as the setting direction on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) belong to the honored .
awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award ceremony .
the L@@ ear &apos;s progressive TV series announced that this is why L@@ ear already announced that the participation in the Gala was announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw from the resources - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an empha@@ sized them to take a conversation with b@@ ump to clear their view .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the earlier award winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city alive
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to retirement in the next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ mer is a t@@ acker .
and his work still makes him great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press process .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that so far no application does not fulfill the requirement profile .
the town is looking for an architect or building engineer at the nearest time .
this is how to pay attention to regular break@@ ers - not enough time for a working revision .
since Has@@ lach was acting as a sub @-@ building authority , the applicant has to suggest the applicant .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if it is no longer able to fill them , the citizens would have to drive up to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity of the city and himself is important , W@@ acker who reports from a good service climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and his staff safe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are present .
the theat@@ rical bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium occupies .
the latter is to beat with around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; when we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks wait for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
be conf@@ isc@@ ated for a city building large play room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , it can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted as flexible .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so h@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of green spaces will often lob@@ b@@ ish by citizens and visitors .
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for that which cle@@ ans &quot; if new buildings are approved , stresses the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ chery .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ chery bears great responsibility anyway .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs all about my table . &quot;
in cooperation and coordination he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
also , his successor remains too long , W@@ acker said : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the place . &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good service climate but also for the further design of the city .
if anyone would like to bury Roland W@@ acker , should study the city of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with technical direction architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction plan law .
building and civil engineering , building planning , construction planning , ad@@ under@@ wer@@ age , administration of urban property buildings , urban farm building with building yard and urban development authority , including monument protection authority , including monument protection .
thrown by bike : southern route locked
the police have previously unknown the blue bicycle from the railway station in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ese Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged , that the subsequent freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go from two male servants and look for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene there were a ros@@ ary roller and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , have brought themselves into large danger and endangered the train traffic .
besides the damage at the Lo@@ k and the facility as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the cost of rail vehicles could also return to the perpet@@ rators .
all in all , there was a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the nar@@ r@@ ator .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be led without disability .
almost ten people went out Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
goods were not made out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 @-@ metre ra@@ ping had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meats , dairy products and chocolate might help to re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( un@@ bund@@ le intest@@ ine )
red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts precisely the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases can ease .
the unbe@@ ar@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA , caused by stomach cra@@ mps and blood vessels , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme drow@@ sin@@ ess .
during those affected normally , meat and dairy products are advised to re@@ lie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote immune cells .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in eating is not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to delicate tissues .
if the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is too far towards inflammation , it may result an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance gives immun@@ ity in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the bau@@ bles of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had their immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han has rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system is working with humans .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated .
she presum@@ ed that the difference to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice became DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them failed in mice .
mice have been re@@ ared in a sterile environment so that they had no intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria broke out on the immune system , researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant promoting cells .
as the active component of the liquid is cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant immune cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our stomach @-@ intestinal markets .
it is unknown whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people such as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , because these cells contribute to the inside surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;

however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks he &apos;s football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started to launch its launch @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to wish three further new comm@@ itments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of his four relevant new comm@@ itments .
&quot; three of them to get there , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew by Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar shiel@@ ding , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertis@@ ements earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is twi@@ sted : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the Prime Minister had always faced with a certain concern to Berlin .
just no stor@@ ks from the party centre , just no head@@ wind from the band - this was the most important desire of the election fighting .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , this has fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees have been watching the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing dis@@ agreements and events in the state @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind .
there were deep precip@@ itation .
and one after the other .
the Federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ist of an Gre@@ ens Parliamentary Group has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the local elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost their A @-@ votes majority to the Opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal State Secretary , Michael Kell@@ ner , asked the slo@@ ping down of the Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ ire to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear interro@@ g@@ ation of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ ire must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and the campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the Green Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true for all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ ed with a SPD candidate , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message had reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is facing the green members of El@@ ke T@@ ear to the CD@@ U without its own government .
it is the preliminary culmin@@ ation of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state .
and nobody knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more , did not calm down the com@@ rades at the time .
according to the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was even worse - and it became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD immediately , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smoothly .
bo@@ asting the com@@ rades in the weeks afterwards again .
then when she had exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next descent .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD faction , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burnt .
and because he didn &apos;t make anything wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister had already been in criticism .
mi@@ ese revers@@ al values came added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just that , because in the past weeks , Weil tried to get more strongly in the Con@@ federation of Ak@@ z@@ ente .
com@@ rades in the context of Martin Schulz did not hide his power in Berlin &apos;s former mayor of Hannover to build his power in Berlin .
they let him grant him , because they were given a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
thereby , because of the parties comp@@ ul@@ sive , the lower @-@ Sax@@ on nature is basically no fault .
and Schulz not at all .
at times , the com@@ rades therefore endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is committed to the green , and above all on the ab@@ ro@@ gue par@@ liament@@ arians in the life@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Ms T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets their own career times about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party companies in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ ire is not elected because of its person as a direct candidate , but over the state list of the Dutch Green Party in parliament , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on par@@ liament@@ arians continues .
the logical consequence , it would be that she returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters for four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the Bundestag to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career ra@@ ging of a future CD@@ U Parliamentary Group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there was more or more detailed reports of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding of the town centre III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his own house in the years can come from the country .
in addition to this , Mayor , Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler , and three representatives of urban development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler released a review of the previous year .
since 1991 , it has been in sensitivity areas .
back then , in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg state took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the district area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development , and not only new construction areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , that it will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount of 8@@ 33 333 Euro , including 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area ?
one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area , interest in interest , san@@ itation .
if necessary , the territorial limits could then be moved again .
on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social town , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal towns , improving the residential and labour conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objective , that is , per property .
the renovation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for the funding will have been running since 1st January 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , only once the changes will be carried out , as part of those who have received a questionnaire for the re@@ plen@@ ishment .
in November or December , the rules of stat@@ ute will be made to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then stated that every municipality had to be carried out prior investigation .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban mis@@ circumstances and decide when san@@ itation is renovated and in what extent .
it will also be entered into the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after emotion and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , a major success factor for the project was the participation of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that would be sent to citizens in the coming weeks , and can be filled out after the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and Property @-@ piece &quot; in which it comes to the structural condition and the renovation purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can be made information on size , distribution , and inhabit@@ ant of a housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only complete when building commercial premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be aware , Got@@ zel showed that a modified questionnaire was not simultaneously an application for funding .
moreover , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding in accordance with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wind@@ hoff Princip@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes first , framed first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they could not be &quot; reserve &quot; for later . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Municip@@ alities II &quot; were shown to make the presence of a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty &quot; .
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the house and by car .
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can enter his door@@ step , enter his office and even can start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index and offers now the service for companies and individuals that want to simpli@@ fy your life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants to ensure that the im@@ plant process is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the palaces on houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the White House &apos;s advertising costs cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event dedicated to the American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military personnel sent to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American builders .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 countries .
in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire @-@ blowing from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck , manufactured in Connecticut .
the White House &apos;s military office called for the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn by the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of helicop@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware , because it is an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , the deputy military commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message shown that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the South La@@ wn at the South La@@ wn for the event , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House was delayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the initial air conditioning was during the event during the helicopter while security personnel remained at the plane during the time at the plane .
the records provided by the TIM@@ E was not clear , if ultimately , a second flight issue was required .
the Hatch Act prohi@@ bits federal secretary , government property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one question we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander answered .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts towards contain@@ ment of government legislation .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically acceptable purposes .
pre@@ sidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump caused an investigation into the investigation as the presidential plane in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that would complain about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy press conference of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the region around Washington and in South La@@ wn by turning the U.S. President at the White House with precise peak of cen@@ timet@@ able .
as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercise clim@@ ates throughout the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event had the training requirement for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ icop@@ ter Units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support committees . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company had not been involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Ministry of Defense for the 2017 budget for fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D substitute for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit , flight time of the airplane , took 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House asser@@ ts that the actual costs for the operation of helicop@@ ters are far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance , and many other hidden costs , which are contained in yearly resources . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the att@@ ach@@ ments for DO@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract statements .
at that time , the former Press@@ ure @-@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things which are manufactured in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most of the Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire @-@ blowing .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top leader of the second tennis @-@ league in the table advanced Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss kicks off tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel on the S@@ V tab@@ s .
despite five games still mak@@ er@@ os@@ er balance , the leader of the second tennis court has received the sense of reality .
in any respect , team boss Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly respect respect of the opponent .
&quot; it is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just in the back positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even point to the Davis Cup .

&quot; it will be as hard for us .
you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ ers team for the trip to the high north is practical .

how America can damage O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his h@@ unter , the law en@@ acted , &quot; Congress held a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; in order , corro@@ sive .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels is fo@@ aming against the U.S. advance .
after all , the draft to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
based on wor@@ rying , investors of the native O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Service Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is massive .
nevertheless , it is too early for the estimate of the consequences , thus the official statement of the Group company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump had to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are given him to choose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen itself which the corporation could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is set at the centre of the Net@@ fli@@ x region
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , Pablo Es@@ co@@ o Killer reveals itself , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not yet over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ red of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed her attention to the richest organization of the drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fortune 500 company &quot; with more state funeral and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodriguez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , the Mexican compound and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe@@ ña , the guy , the American and Colom@@ bian law en@@ forcement agencies , to support war on drugs .
further new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back@@ wards : the city introduces 46 kitchen staff .
the town organis@@ es the Kit@@ a mid@@ table again .
fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock will be turned back .
as of September 1 , the City of Kre@@ feld will take over the municipal kinder@@ garten of day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy director in the field of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
boiled out of the house : a Cater@@ pillar takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled .
the city runs out in the fields of 46 day@@ care facilities , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
last year of kit@@ ten , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there are not only children who have taken care of 45 week@@ days in the day@@ care centre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 research teams from 1 September kitchen service : they heat the supplied food , add to salad , raw food and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sevent@@ een @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen women are now firm to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for the day@@ time , simpler and educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is why it works : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen strength of the team is meaningful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the Kit@@ a , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important to children .
the pur@@ ge of the kit@@ a spaces - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also provided the charm of the quality improvement in the kitchen capacity , in addition to the cost comparison between self @-@ ruling and foreign exchange for the city as the most cost @-@ effective , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial forces are re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 persons in the educational area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , Head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are killed in the provinces of the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women can not be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be truly representative and believ@@ able if women are in@@ appropriate and included in all parts of the election process .
the Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban announced threats against a election process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be the power to meet peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

men attempt to cut 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls
two young men aged 19 to 23 years have to be tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union is aimed at managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on long @-@ term commitment to produce production in Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has pushed over the future of investments in the Toll@@ er location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
in recent years Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ i said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the Manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; doubts that financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pre@@ driven . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we have no clarity of the general manager and investment plans for the future of ra@@ bies , affects our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have been working here and the workers must focus on the local community and the large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and before the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing life cost and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently desper@@ ate a thri@@ ving production of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ i said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ ppo has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland last yesterday , and the company will respond directly on it , as we estimate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in Toll@@ ing , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all enterprises that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our businesses constantly check - and that applies to all of our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ y@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of Toll@@ er as production facilities . should our business processes change at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after deduc@@ ting a £ 189 million in order to dissolve its free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but they warned Barcelona in front of the world record three years ago ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is li@@ vid about the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans state is that the club has always been given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly stated that they would not allow it to go to the International International from Italy , and Barcelona managed to feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar .

an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ ar@@ au and Le@@ ese seeks the police witness .
because it was a car to meet him on the track , the driver had to draw a VW Tour@@ an out and touch@@ eth the conductor plan@@ ks .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ er was on the B 215 from Stol@@ ar@@ au coming towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of Stol@@ ar@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his track , so that he had to depart to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver comp@@ lied with the conductor plann@@ er .
Sach@@ inj@@ ected was created in the car .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued its trip to take care of traffic accident .
according to the accident , it may be good , that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ inion @-@ atzen report , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ reg@@ atta @-@ Report for the abuse of the Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report for the mis@@ lead sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ au continued for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained according to the publication of the German Press Agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today , Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express her deep regret about their own under@@ side or their then false assessment of the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no doubt about the traditions in Regensburg doubt that there should be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the hab@@ it that the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischen Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to go on the church and this is a gre@@ ased fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in their youth &quot; saw a quite normal educational tool &quot; had been &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ ed children , as I was one . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to turn the standards for past few decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
entirely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who responded with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ant At@@ tor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ au became sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high blood @-@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 dom@@ eter and sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , let &apos;s hold that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could be also severe .
nevertheless , unlike many other accus@@ ations , many of the victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories will be linked to him . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report for the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ au Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion is dischar@@ ged .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence to Prot@@ ects &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ le@@ hammer , &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one raise many students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to others , it also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has been tan@@ gible , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you analyze this final report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
to him , eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion or mit@@ age in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violence at the pre@@ school also occurred outside its efficiency sphere .
it can happen to him , if you want to experience too late or did not take the first suggestion too seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was received from practically all those questioned - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven , &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent witness , describing him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sin@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ minded teachers who supplied them regularly with cakes , biscuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high eg@@ oc@@ ion@@ ality , which led to wre@@ cking .
that he did not only threw those with chairs and threw the key h@@ aul@@ ts on the floor , but also ear@@ marked with ear@@ thly boys and ears , he himself had been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for themselves .
however , it has to be said to have said that such educational methods were widely used in the fra@@ ction period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as in teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a state of school .
compared with what is in this report , namely , the di@@ re sexual mis@@ use and the violence at the pre@@ school , this is free bag@@ at@@ els .
one has already wonder@@ ing if it does not seem to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , so many media has just collapsed on him .
on the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him , still eager to be ze@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report sent Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report , the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse during the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also posted any settlement or contribut@@ or in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a covered representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then it is certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
how do we assess the Dom@@ inion disciples R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student was form@@ ulated so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had been right ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) , and could have had his own perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I hold it ... also for really absurd , assume that it is just opened ... boys ob@@ tru@@ sive or clear@@ er , or rather opened up , as compared to their parents , international guide , confidenti@@ ality , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report on the very clear result is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ous student and / or their environment , the examination could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has to be free from every contribut@@ ory .
so he cannot be charged with him , not prevented , or to be brought to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
in the media there was a lot of &quot; violence to read &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ heim .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; seeing &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the great problem that everything was mixed in the reporting and it was taken to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the midst , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
it is set up separately : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ au College , between sexu@@ alized mis@@ use and violence as well as , we say once , other fix@@ tures .
furthermore , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , i.e. , from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ au .
all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ disti@@ c@@ cul@@ ed teachers were quite similar and mal@@ nourished , they all have to be successful at the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous circumstances have to have .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boy at his face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; tab@@ oos .
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there is already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ st violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims &quot; the general humanity of R. estimates , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories will connect with him . &quot;
so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from his predec@@ essors , at a school where he did not work and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
en@@ closures Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ahead of the conditions ri@@ gor@@ ously the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um which the report was even re@@ produced .
in this regard , he refers to that &quot; that in the pre@@ school , the test sentence will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
he sees urgent income in view of the danger of negative charges .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was long ago as a test sentences were long been banned in Bavaria .
before that , it occurred in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows of us .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the victims were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the allow@@ able border had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away .
that just doesn &apos;t agree .
the test sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria in 1980 , and officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to approach the standards of contemporary ped@@ ago@@ gic standards at the time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger that the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princ@@ ess has already right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able to all times , and not for what was broken in the nursery school and violence against innocent children &apos;s boards , which goes far beyond that .
all of this is quite horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be done .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its means to discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear @-@ ri@@ sts and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also has strictly adher@@ ed to .
what &apos;s the image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of reference to the language also ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ ans played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I &apos;m not sure that he led a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent in there .
but this also has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which no un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of cat@@ tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went out twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one acc@@ ru@@ ly makes no big singers but at any success , right on which area , but always discipline , passion and self overcome .
what a man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on your book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quite well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deep faithful and hear@@ ty people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something a fly a little bit too .
I get regularly with how many former dom@@ ites are still today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly about them , are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ ites are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always is a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be , but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they still have views and honour them today .
and please , once more clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educ@@ ating methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have never overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and an even more prominent brother to make a spiritual sin@@ u@@ ck .
there is the bad intention that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report which has just been published , loaded him .
now the ambul@@ ance area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who had acquired a great promise and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps even Germany probably nobody wanted to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ au , finally in peace .
