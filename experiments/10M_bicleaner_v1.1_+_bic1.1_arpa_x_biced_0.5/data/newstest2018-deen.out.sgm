<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four maps that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are meeting today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A seftkapelle, where the S-Bahn tunnel will be dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers work the rusty reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not currently current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to be exciting already because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a rectiring road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offering of the geoportals in Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the broader area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickentepatic, which one can not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The great coverage map were set up for cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called pristings.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration, between 1810 and 1864, and of the first surveying Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second World War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally pulled off the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a wide-wide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">KurfürstMax IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urgency Award for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the others found on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has extended itself into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was granted 21 years after drawing up the map, in 1877, as the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the houses are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West park is, you can see nothing but fields - at the first sight: in the Hineinzooming, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called 'Urbino, "which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels do not prove to farmers more - but small gardeners of the complex "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is characterised by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the contrary, in the area of the present district, Au-Haidhausen can not only read the street names "at the" Gasteig "or by the front" on the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one has once locked people with madments.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was the Munich Circle-Irpension at the Auer Lübeck in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder, headed by the establishment of the psychiatrist, led by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced to his time and ended for example the Chains of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for building the Kreisky penitentiary in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Youngsters on the former Auer Ward is now going to meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with a training course.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west is the soccer field of TSV Munich East, east residential houses of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - built in a architectonic way to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during WWII during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was named "Head Square," the Kaufingerway was named "Kaufinger lane."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War led to the heart of the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="46">The allies of the Allies broke out many holes in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb of the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days work on and on 5 April 2017 on the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting gallery, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Published Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of farms has issued a warning for colored human beings who are travelling due to discriminating policy and racist attacks by the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal state of Missouri, which is alleged until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourced, as a number of fragility, racial presence in the whole state can be noticed and stated here," "" "says the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as prosecuting minorities of the state, which cause disproportionate the group to publish the journey, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of the citizens of citizenship that happen to humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be stopped because of their skin color, they are put together or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group of events such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and Death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state of Missouri, and was accused of accused of crimes of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri, which showed that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff of what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people have to be willing to bring along the money money or the relatives, that they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes according to the latest numbers from the FBI, the FBI, which ranks the state in regards to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had adopted itineraries for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed, the local prosecuting authorities were committed to repaid people because of immigration defects, which will contribute to the further expansion of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel maintenance are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the rectory court of the Schwendemann family met representatives of the fishing bacher CDU-suburban together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into its operation, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young are accommodated and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, so swivel.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the most beautiful, it is entirely regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he also described the BLHV-Chairman of Fishbach, it also described the fence project as "elementar."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate so steep surfaces on derart.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for a lot of work, must be processed using the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have been struggling with the terms and the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elteristic operation and use this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leaders promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers should be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the capacity of the surface could still be pulled out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and to make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "says the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 on the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open space area amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be choosen up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was funded by leader, a quarter brought the village of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers had to invest 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and virgins."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß:" "" "there are best foods produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-level of agriculture (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The finish is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is a prone by the lpr.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fence does not have to be volatile (Hanging above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space is equivalent to 35 hectares, with a total cost of more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest mark of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans like each other - as well as each other - the sorrowed fall of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologist of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hot quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president to drastic limitations of the legal migration of the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde by boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have had it, if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked her importance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to, as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his basis was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complain," "" "I don't want to go on a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American liberty which lights the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the changing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your waste, your poor, and your necessary masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the elight waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who started to place their words after their death at the base - was very good that they did a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The compound of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change it long from right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty has no one invite, but rather an early neo-conservative, who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh is encountered here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the perception of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantastic act of Lazarus was to see them as they see from the exhausted, elly, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, to see the world from perspective of people, seek refuge and give a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever wanted to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not shine on the way, but hatred that is the only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schotts belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship title" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue to continue until we find it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that something has to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy in the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butten, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance while Eiliie Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain word was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie brought all of course were magnificent. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silbermedaillenev, who will compete in its fifth world championships for the 400-m hurdles, says it "incredible" that 16 Schotts are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, who were met in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance of Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The capitalist capital says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only belonging to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special feature of team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, making it something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the gravel who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to poets.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as captain affects?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block Critics via Facebook: do not work for a public office, if you cannot bear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the Domestic Policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He stumbled upon criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't make his critics silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, as sheep are led to the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it, to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sent him so early this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor of the Governor, dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it is only Facebook" "", "many people said." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand at the leadership of its state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary resources to connect with his voters and playing his haunless head to chemotherapy on its side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking of persons who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially, and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Spreader Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor, arguing that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of cast or spammers or water filled people who swaying the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post talked with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and unprofane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest renounced the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD, was not satisfied, but she asked to hate them.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on hate and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news statement" The Post. "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I really appreciate this idea even if a number of people on the same subject takes place, then it will be recognized by some more than a collective collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the Governors of the Governor referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "interceticism."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's a lot more cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conductors to burn, or to silence demonstrators, or to silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly what is happening in digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticised that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the first asparment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the period of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers contributed between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous letter proposed to its leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who use pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters of newspapers, Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which have criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents published by the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could not have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only exists at the border border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible, but the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are supposed to prevent a "savings" of the landscape.</seg>

<seg id="519">With a view on ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district was not aimed at the reasoning of the association "Boisheim" itself.</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four kilometres of wind turbines at a surface area of the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, involved in which the city of Viersen is centralised, were closed to the owners of approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be met - this corresponds to approximately one-fifth of all four-four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">In the last summer, Fortress City Council issued green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich in Aachen and a part in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg, with Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Any consequences will be made for Paris Saint-Germain on the UEFA, as the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to negotiate teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair Play rules, which were called by the UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG had to point out sometime that the transfer of Neymar was financed without a major loss.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian ans from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>

<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in the Chelsea in 2003, and then invested a club with potential, and then invested heavily in order to build the team and build a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="1133">While the current three-year-old FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of up to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to make it a bit of excessive expenditures.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps has plans to limit new Chief of Staff to limit the Presidency of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly will actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, at his first working day with senior employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that have entered the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said that information about him should flow through - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would take better decisions when he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense but others have attempted to tame Trump, by monitoring its medical device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now where he is at the White House, his TV advertisement is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when the candidate was offended, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince him," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February versus POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Policos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit is taking control, according to six former campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a priceless praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever 'was under control, is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets have no more spark plug without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it a few times, trouble away from it, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house composed of competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Materials, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported on the preference of advising the preference for the preference for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials said that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press prints, especially those with shameful lung cheques, and that it turns out to figure out where these come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Just that happened at the end of February, when someone sent a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of being" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned from Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence or that he expressed incorrect preaches in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is alleged to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel has taken up work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under vocation of the people familiar.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper recorded the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there is already the first precharging of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin to have been engaged in the presidential election in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines if there were agreements between Trumps electrophy and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations are aimed at investigating several men who acted in the election campaign as advisor of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also adopted more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post wrote a couple of weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally got into the centre and check the accusation if the president possibly has hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys, to examine and decide, to examine and decide whether he should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on, if there are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to turn persons to the interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the broadcaster, CNN were already shown to meet the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were prompted by a statement, named it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., Trumps consultants and law-law Jared Kushner and his damaging campaign manager Paul Manafort were involved in conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the insertion show that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he should be needed to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end in order to decide about the arrest of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the enforcement of the Gremium of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president took an address in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject give the Democrats a way to feel "good, because they have nothing else to talk about that."</seg>

<seg id="1505">This, however, usually work in the obedience, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent" "" "faire" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times, that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed in it, its name was further explained in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was not first used after Trump had fired comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this ramp, accusations against Trump had become noisy, he wanted to hinder justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June prior to a Senate committee, Trump asked him to have asked for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This led speculation about whether Trump Mueller would be dismissed.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the west-Antarctica a gigantic iceberg has replaced the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelleis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The weighing over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 sq km big coloss are now moved to the north and will probably take two or three years until he is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is equipped with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest iccaries who have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">When climate change played a role during the crash of the iron, research is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, the US research center for snow and ice cream has been held in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The coloss was now a part of the Larsen-C-Schelcows.</seg>
<seg id="1528">The bowls swim on the sea and is peaked by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It always grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcows is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was the balance of waxes and disruptions several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes in a complete shame, writes AWI.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shrinking is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and could fall, if at a key point a piece of breaking.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelcows and Eisberg increases the sea level, because they swim in the water and pushes the ice so much water as it gives the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shrine is that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in small measures, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelcows is the fourth largest in the Antarctica for almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The front of the mainland is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural creature and no direct connection to climate change is aware, the ice plate is now in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelcows will come back again, and possibly close together, his colleague Adrian Luckman, added, added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher will not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not to climate change, so in the past decades, many ice caps of the Antarctic peninsula are torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirts of Antarctica is located towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and counter to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high-inclusive effect of the E-Sports.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the management consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth ahead of the E-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for the reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and impending drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what safer to feel: they are supposed to take their children with the office that were the goal of a attack with grenades in 2009 or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: adversary, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug mugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break of violence, while in all the country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto gave up his office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you find the editor and its irirator of Riodoce, Co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows his Central finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smelling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though a special position was built in 2010, to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the committee, it has led to the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug dealers and organic crimes each year, the murderers are only rarely issued by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still consist of treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, although the terrain is now still digitalized.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid, my time to waste in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we missed all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce's office in Culiacan's capital.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was shot from two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "Tweld River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to move freely around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as riveting fractions are fighting it to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of wounded, two-story Mausoleen for drug-trees that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "remember for a minute that there is a state of" "" "tranquility" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, there was the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rival antitrust in war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have offended the sons, presumed gait bought every copy of the output when it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to force the same story after the seizure of a different newspaper, which had the same history to leave the country in its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce's founding member and sold 50 U.S. dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without violating the racotta problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">The newspaper has served as a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took part.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard to publish studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Mary-Moors-Cabot Award" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever they led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I would like to live more," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug dealers in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take the task of taking part in a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done before so many? why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird that could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-proof and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it does wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be duped... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous blend of lucrative smugings, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were entrusted by the state government to protect the Riodoce's offices in a four-class building of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in jest, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who called Governor themselves as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain country, where drug bound de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has captured on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposition on the spending, focusing on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the State Office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped, or as it happened, so caution was enjoined when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI).</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of highly harvesting cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escapes a military incident.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez, considered the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with nickname" "" "El FLACO" "" "because of its slim body." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something that they never expected, activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez snap a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adverge disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests that it is its own.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pionate journalists and bring them to them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then, that she is divided by the government because she is worried that her anger violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists entertained in Mexico of organised crime, involved in government officials and a equality of equality. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters did not only be killed by drug bound, but also on orders of politicians and security forces which were organised with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers found out that this plant-eater, though it is covered with a armor, and resembles a wall, probably threatened by meat-eaters dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong mored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide in front of predatory, and used a parachuting technique that is known as a countercremation, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed better to interfere in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the family of Nodosaurier came from the headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and Borealopelta markmitchelli is named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">It enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the conspirators, a widespread defense method in animal life, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the convection is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta is far beyond the animals of today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was chased out of sufficient pressure by the carnivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was favourable as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that deploy the consolation - think about deer, zebras, or girdles - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this nodosaurier had been exposed to a true struggle.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviours on a massive, highly contaminated dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rob have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including his preserved Darmintes to find out what it eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, ran into a river and driven into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserving skin, but also has been preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, had gone through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the mored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was soaked after death in the sea and in mud.</seg>

<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to thigh.</seg>

<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes, which was raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was drilled through the Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor of the ticket control at No. Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already unofficial online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can still go on to sleep, keep silent, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "who wants to travel without ticket control through our train companion, check out the DB navigator yourself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2011">Second-plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter into individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who travel often, knows that in addition to delay and passions the ticket controls are one of the biggest medical products.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one does not have any documents in any case, but it does not need any documents you need for the application of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either missing the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between drawbacks and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the abyss or large space and delays in the control of your own tickets and take the Schaffner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after it arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an airbnb-apartment, which they rented and scroll by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post of somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the road" "" "it was there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else had posted on their feedback, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was there, death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., was killed.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "he thought about himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">They put their cell phone to buy tweets on people on the Canfield drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, who cried out, and from a man who claimed that Browns to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed at which a policeman was faced with protesters in front of a group of demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, secured a different policeman and cried, "I will kill you... Pets all kill you."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"it is not common," Ferrell remembers their testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we used to accustomed to call ourselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she won her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas down from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people who live in community life and have filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As ferrell with her daughter, which carried a flower-dress, and a perfect crown, came to Ferguson, making them both a conversation, which they had numerous times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "they remembered that which she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we go now to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year old boy, and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it away, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her a experience, in which they personally do not experience ecatant racism, it is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to keep them far away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Floral Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground as the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson waited.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local businessowner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They made bags before and helped to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new kind of activism for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after the 9th of August, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell arrived in an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farmers wanted to only document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell's sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area responsible for his activism around Todestract-Insular occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment was closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns shot.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as those people are portrayed, because I will be shown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The aim was to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is "not a Messiah guide, but in order to act a community that comes together," said Folayan, and proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, as she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the realization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Furthermore, Ferrells's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the murder of the black teenage Trayby Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify itself as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting with different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmatical type of action," in which, based on its identity as the heart of the film was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front of the front, because in a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen. "</seg>

<seg id="2081">He is based on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clung to singing and she feels committed to this memory, since she walked in Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dreams" to "megaahn": TV reader discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the southern edge of the pedestrian street has been splits in support for the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly can be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one at the Bit Gallery said: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need man" (Siggi Balls) or simply simply: "size!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, as well as the other business benefits, fear the adversaries, that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market stands in the 13 direct marketing products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">Construction work will conclude with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery macher want to integrate a market place in the new building - in fact for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we've been selling almost weekly in the Peasantry thalle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maidens always loves again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">The butcher shop also discovered us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that, during and, especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there are also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether the direct market in a market hall is located in the gallery, get to the height of the rent.</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping is in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drinke- or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since it's not even a regular weekly market, it is more important that at least the market hall should be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered at the service is fresh, mostly offered by the producer and is extremely clean.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop stores are rented in a shopping center only by bigger firms, because the local anets are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special business are almost no longer and that which is still left, will probably still disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market stands doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmers market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the Bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it make the ghosts bit-Gallery to drive all businesses from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs no one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant hall, yes, thanks to the sincere many - how I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers markets are broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible, the similar to cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of cheeks-tups and hair cuts that were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analytical minister served a 35-year sentence after it publicly made diplomatic messages about the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was founded in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that might be extracted from Manning and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone could not only look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, born as Bradley, was born in 2013, but has already been talking about the identification as a woman, has been sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde seduces - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came on from the great success of their 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigars pumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were sentenced to unequal spectacles over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Supporters Images," which would like to predict the future in which the President Chelating would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only had a few days after the book was released, Mannings would call for release seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison, was a welcome kind of happy communions.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also an exhibition at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and towards transgender troops to find out new, tweezers, which he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen to a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called upon Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic fatigue, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millennium release of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped that the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific icon of the artist) show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people hopefully will take away is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and like openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell you so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition located in an own room is one page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she emerged with a free spins in hand from the disciplines of the United States, as King of Hong Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint this desire is an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance-industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial technical website let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convert, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year, amidst the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convert has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convert Company makes custom-made "Puls-" Polls send confidential responses in real time and watch the warmth-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive board is involved, complaints are to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convert.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his employees are badly treated or unethical, it can experience precious consequences due to consumers' boycott, workers of fluoriation and clerings, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has hired Convert for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and a simple way to achieve its headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or email to the company headquarters, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now since the company is converting the Convert, problems that were previously identified by executives that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or irregular trainees were identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employees in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen broke up with the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "Social Media" came to their right "that businesses realized that they could not prevent their dirty clothes online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people use hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and load the companies with recurrent fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, which both supports start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convert received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the entire capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Only $10 million in November from Bessemer venture partner and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's staff expect more jobs than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you accept and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which is both Convert and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditch, when their portfolio company run well. companies run smoothly when employees are involved and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools promise third promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employees of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless when the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees to your feedback, it can have expectancy that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this can motivate disappointments and motivating employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you have to ask 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the business management company Kotter International, who has seen the company to be very keen on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the staff," "" "Do you really hear me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys now, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the feedback of frustrated employees it was due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">On Ruby Tuesday the company will always get new insights over employees, and it hopes for a long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector, which is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you will also lose our customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a canophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy headquarters in the Conscious River valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful on the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says," ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist, Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brianna May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only wrote on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double female in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time they lit a fire because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as it would be there even though.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who was beaten with old papers that he will be supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") this seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodesdos spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the mounted hyena heads on walls and bottles which had spent centuries in trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access to 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the loft. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps that represent what they possessed: "one could mean that land confollicte would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view a wider basis into the English history, among them 'The Labourer', who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse dating back to 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry started in this field and I thought, an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit Paters that the family Darrell hid seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler' in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell portrayed out of the 18th century, which filled his own funeral (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the men seemed to be the right gauner to make debts and spend money for things that they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men put their debtors to marry their old women - I introduce them as a heap of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique screaming experience</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness of a comic novel about Elongänmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been recalled again by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like me, "Oh, now I have to get back with the damned life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign launched: covered over 300 years old Marian's chapel in Rhöndorf</seg>

<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent another 7395 stataters, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not be reunited in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot is currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun, but the companies provide a lot of them, and we will see them more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuffs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silica that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can modify his robot in accordance with his beliefs "and thereby select everything from the eye color of the robot about the form of nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford-wife progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silica.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot makes it possible for example their users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as for instance.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relapy and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods throughout the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversation or can be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrisome aspects on this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female properties that goes to rape if one step on Frigid (means: conflicting) Farrah is concerned, discomfort one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" is it on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasingly refinement refer to something dark and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire to having sex with underpation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are of course not holding sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity, they still remain in the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakened out of the boundary zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, be very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until they have given the free market to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">However, there is a certain surge that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time that the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a presidents in the White House so that it has become sexually assorted to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic pictures, the enclosures and outsidered eyes, but how realistic this vision is effective.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this won't feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robots is to have a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenweishness of Trump-era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voters, also have families split into small size.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly pledged to take advantage of our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The power of Trumps, Families, has been less noticed.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago and has lived for a long time with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unity of a joint enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including Republican relationship, with whom they fought for decades of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context, that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting impact of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his mittens will not be discharged by one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a still afraid of long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an epitome of veronableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's kompetitive version of crazy (but at least we knew how his tax statement saw) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur in a very mild strapping.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only intellectually healthy to qualify as a measurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussel of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are becoming old, the Skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not yet over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, because here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody was asked afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before using my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same thing plus the option to reduce the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slow exchange of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation, which is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologized, while I tired the experience, to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after a appeal of prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steelamp in the early morning of the Valentine's Day in 2013, by firing them several times by a door of the toilet paper in his house in Pretoria, on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intruder, who hidden himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal to the six year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell which they say they are to be spinning.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution Authority reported that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2561">Also, his successor remains too long, Wacker said: "we are looking for someone who really identifies and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good service climate but also for the further design of the city.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meats, dairy products and chocolate might help to relieve IBD (unbundle intestine)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts precisely the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases can ease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unbearable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the USA, caused by stomach cramps and blood vessels, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected normally, meat and dairy products are advised to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in eating is not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it may result an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance gives immunity in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the baubles of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had their immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan has rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system is working with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She presumed that the difference to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice became DNA sequenced and there were six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them failed in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice have been reared in a sterile environment so that they had no intestinal microbiom and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria broke out on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid is cleansed, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as the Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant immune cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our stomach-intestinal markets.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is unknown whether tryptophan by products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people such as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells contribute to the inside surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Anyone who wants to renovate his own house in the years can come from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition to this, Mayor, Albert Schindler, and three representatives of urban development on Wednesday in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler released a review of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, it has been in sensitivity areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004, the Baden-Württemberg state took over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the district area II from 2005 to 2016, the supplement was still at 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler the existing renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, and not only new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that it will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount of 833 333 Euro, including 500 000 Euro from the country, the rest of the community sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a rehabilitation area?</seg>

<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role, whether in the planned area, interest in interest, sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial limits could then be moved again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellar presented the contents of the federal government program "Social town," in which the renovations would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program are the revitalisation of internal towns, improving the residential and labour conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be objective, that is, per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for the funding will have been running since 1st January 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Even until September this year, however, only once the changes will be carried out, as part of those who have received a questionnaire for the replenishment.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the rules of statute will be made to begin with the renovations in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then stated that every municipality had to be carried out prior investigation.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is therefore to evaluate the urban miscircumstances and decide when sanitation is renovated and in what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">It will also be entered into the basic book for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again after emotion and make a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized, a major success factor for the project was the participation of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires that would be sent to citizens in the coming weeks, and can be filled out after the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Property-piece" in which it comes to the structural condition and the renovation purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2702">However, to be aware, Gotzel showed that a modified questionnaire was not simultaneously an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Moreover, new building measures are not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="2719">The White House's military office called for the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before helicopter landed on the South Lawn by the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of helicopters.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "I just wanted you to be aware, because it is an unusual event with great visibility," "" "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy military commander for aviation." ""</seg>

<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts towards containment of government legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically acceptable purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers were not the burden for any of the other props that were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said the company had not been involved to put the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budget drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the US Ministry of Defense for the 2017 budget for fiscal year 2017, the DOD substitute for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight hour.</seg>

<seg id="2871">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will contact them in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign one of our players in themselves, this will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG clearly stated that they would not allow it to go to the International International from Italy, and Barcelona managed to feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their prizes for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccer was on the B 215 from Stolarau coming towards Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of Stolarau, a passenger car came to meet him on his track, so that he had to depart to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">In doing so, the Touran driver complied with the conductor planner.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued its trip to take care of traffic accident.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Dominion-atzen report, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domregatta-Report for the abuse of the Pope John Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the mislead scandal at the Regensburger Domspau continued for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement, "We are Church," explained according to the publication of the German Press Agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger Bishop and today, Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express her deep regret about their own underside or their then false assessment of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Law," "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence with" "" "two standards" "" "measures." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">There is no doubt about the traditions in Regensburg doubt that there should be "shameful and shameful deeds," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit that the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischen Rundfunk:" "" "we would like to go on the church and this is a greased fresco." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, she pointed out that in their youth "saw a quite normal educational tool" had been "to be done with cheeked children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to turn the standards for past few decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Entirely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who responded with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenant Attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspau became sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high blood-sensitivity" "" "victims of overprint, 67 dometer and sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, let's hold that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">At high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could be also severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other accusations, many of the victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories will be linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report for the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspau Georg Ratzinger in his opinion is discharged.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence to Protects" at the Regensburger Domlehammer, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one raise many students" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">In addition to others, it also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which has been tangible, when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">To him, eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion or mitage in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violence at the preschool also occurred outside its efficiency sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can happen to him, if you want to experience too late or did not take the first suggestion too seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was received from practically all those questioned - literally - "salvation," "heaven," and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent witness, describing him as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "sinful" "", "as extremely good-minded teachers who supplied them regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" "" "always surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high egocionality, which led to wrecking.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw those with chairs and threw the key haults on the floor, but also earmarked with earthly boys and ears, he himself had been deeply regretted and apologized for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it has to be said to have said that such educational methods were widely used in the fraction period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced that in a worldly school, a state of school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what is in this report, namely, the dire sexual misuse and the violence at the preschool, this is free bagatels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One has already wondering if it does not seem to do with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, so many media has just collapsed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him, still eager to be zealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report sent Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse during the Domensburger Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also posted any settlement or contributor in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a covered representative for the others," "" "It was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then it is certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we assess the Dominion disciples Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student was formulated so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had been right (Georg Ratzinger), and could have had his own perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for really absurd, assume that it is just opened... boys obtrusive or clearer, or rather opened up, as compared to their parents, international guide, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - thinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report on the very clear result is:" "" "in the apprentious student and / or their environment, the examination could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has to be free from every contributory.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be charged with him, not prevented, or to be brought to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "violence to read" at the Regensburger Domenheim.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "seeing" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that everything was mixed in the reporting and it was taken to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is set up separately: between the preschool and high school of the Domspau College, between sexualized misuse and violence as well as, we say once, other fixtures.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report incidents from the time since 1945, i.e., from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domspau.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadisticculed teachers were quite similar and malnourished, they all have to be successful at the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous circumstances have to have.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boy at his face when they were already at the Domspatzymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, like most witnesses, the subject "Pre-School" taboos.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there is already discipline, but no sadist violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims" the general humanity of R. estimates, and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories will connect with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at most, the accusation remains to be looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from his predecessors, at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Enclosures Georg Ratzinger ahead of the conditions rigorously the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this regard, he refers to that "that in the preschool, the test sentence will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">He sees urgent income in view of the danger of negative charges.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was long ago as a test sentences were long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the victims were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the allowable border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just doesn't agree.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980, and officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to approach the standards of contemporary pedagogic standards at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "Fallacck of Anachronism," so the danger that the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and not for what was broken in the nursery school and violence against innocent children's boards, which goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">All of this is quite horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be done.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"" "" "" "its means to disciplines and punishment, i.e. ear-rists and ears, were widely used in the 1970s." ""</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also has strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What's the image of his Regensburger Zeit, Georg Ratzinger has given you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of reference to the language also?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspans played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I'm not sure that he led a stricter regiment in there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without which no unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of cattrang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went out twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, one accruly makes no big singers but at any success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on your book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faithful and hearty people, from which one can't imagine that he could do something a fly a little bit too.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domites are still today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly about them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domites are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be, but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still have views and honour them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that one accuses to him are educating methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have never overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and an even more prominent brother to make a spiritual sinuck.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the bad intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which has just been published, loaded him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the ambulance area, a 93-year-old man, who had acquired a great promise and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps even Germany probably nobody wanted to know the Regensburger Domspau, finally in peace.</seg>
