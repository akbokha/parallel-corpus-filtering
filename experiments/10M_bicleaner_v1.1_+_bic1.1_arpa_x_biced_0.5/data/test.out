Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are obvious .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses re@@ minded of their holiday , they hunt in quick gal@@ lop home to feeding home .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - back to horses .
he left himself with his family about the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he sw@@ ang on photo .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ aler handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala to Golden Sports pyramid .
there is no lack of the lik@@ able athl@@ ete .
Bundes@@ amt Cross , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen pushed him already .
the 18th prize winners of the pyramid pil@@ es is long .
in Aachen , he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award will give me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she will not only be awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more outstanding athletes , the double US @-@ mast winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Ru@@ im Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the ski@@ pping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society immig@@ rated to the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za cost ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the major animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure to invest and prevent trading agreement T@@ TP , they want to use Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential competitors are , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic request .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the state , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to be rather small in doubt and warns against that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wanted to best@@ ow the economy to death and regulate his death , he says .
in contrast , he would be completely different , claiming Tr@@ ump .
he will drive regulatory appro@@ vals , and makes it strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses .
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to fulfill he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
that &apos;s why the taxes were raised to the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
to be invested in the country , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost immediately .
the democratic applicants have even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ od@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , then party internal discussions could be returned .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal support in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris Climate Agreement plans to termin@@ ate .
Clinton aims to expand and strengthen renewable energies with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - also with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the cap@@ aci@@ al trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the United States do not want to ins@@ ulate from international trade - just better protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , Clinton demands Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is necessary , he says he must not be changed .
however , the major discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants to un@@ load the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least of the weal@@ thy wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in his arm .
he gu@@ cks with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she noticed that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the division &apos;s division of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ ot@@ ted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
un@@ long it was opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is an watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who comes here has made her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because they are politically persecuted because they are torture or death , or because their families are sending them to Europe as a hope for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many do not steal away because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ oring , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; for example , tu@@ g@@ boats are demanding a bottle of water for a bottle of water , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they would appear in Germany , is told by B@@ ahr .
here too , all women in refugee are often referred to as inferior amounts of less and ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the Munich @-@ North , are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar with that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not trying to help , more accommodations need for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they were using a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in accommodation in the governments .
in Schw@@ aben , women alone were not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ ure pre@@ acher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some community shel@@ ters or their own homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations for women there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or men and women gather together , it may be too - persistent - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower rooms should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this protection must be felt , you can read on the And@@ re , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have talked about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
general denti@@ sts : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new campaign measures
deputy members of Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have called for their union to appro@@ ve new meetings with their disp@@ utes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more meetings from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been ab@@ le@@ ased to go on concerns about the Treaty .
assistant doctors and medical assist@@ ants have agreed in July about the re@@ jection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have coordinated with the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; di@@ har@@ r@@ lich quietly , &quot; what led to the agreement that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC bure@@ au matched the proposed new contract to complete the proposed new agreement with all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has set up a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to make a running program es@@ escal@@ ating labour measures starting in early September .
the disp@@ utes reported that Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists had to be six times a year , the first total loss in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election of the agreed agreement , had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ aries and Medi@@ oc@@ inst@@ ants , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy H@@ unt MEP , said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of external side@@ ways &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish opponent in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot honour the int@@ ru@@ cks that Ankara wants to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was a stroke , yes .
but Put@@ ting smile worked lightly and hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for its restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report every five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not just return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved so much as it would never happen something bad .
it seemed to me , enthusiasm , to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ aming , sustainable Kü@@ h@@ le showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ asted .
Putin was par@@ ted and accused Ankara to have Russia in the back .
it was even greater , since it was committed by a m@@ oo@@ ed friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be difficult again when not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media introduced a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed like the Turks would bear the debt for everything .
on the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior officials said that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in territories of Syria , which controls the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he disputed that v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of Erdo@@ gan who wanted to listen .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clear .
Erdo@@ gan is first of all friends who can get after he became a coup d &quot; é@@ tat in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal hi@@ on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the national television budget predicted fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it in this way : &quot; tourists there for long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is up@@ li@@ vid to the West because it was a response to the attempted coup as a weak response .
to do this , the pro@@ longed res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to withdraw from the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian State of State won a bonus for ensuring that he requested a coup d &quot; é@@ tat against the elected government of government .
this is for Moscow , a self @-@ understanding that himself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ assy palace at the sea , it enabled Russia and Turkey , as it once described me an analyst , &quot; Alliance of external side@@ ans &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and treated badly .
nevertheless , despite the public pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ ation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow gave himself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides .
it could be noted that after almost three hours of hearing both President at the press conference said that they didn &apos;t even stri@@ ve the subject .
the president of Turkey avoided it inten@@ tionally to respond to a question about their differences while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open en@@ dencies - and in view of the potential for a complete Dis@@ aster , as NATO member of Turkey fired the Russian mar@@ tial jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is due to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Board .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand were connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since been dist@@ anced since then , when she had to be saved almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
during this time brand str@@ at@@ ches &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumer products .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to press more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alized head@@ quarter and the stock market change to Nat@@ West change .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand , as well as the brand , which our employees will be employed here , as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing a global goals , but follow their local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with our customers .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will not continue to continue and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in his sports sponsor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop for the Bank of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori finished his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market in Friday .
he was trained at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race course with his second win of night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , Lester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three winner winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won against G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ quet Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori tak@@ eth the jubil@@ ation when he cat@@ ches the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s met the milestone in the obstac@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth time Der@@ b@@ ys@@ ers had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 of career @-@ goat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern arts and it &apos;s no surprise that he has achieved this milestone , just a few ahead of him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intellec@@ tu@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a couple of weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains when he would not just be a weekend and grand@@ pa jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie already had almost 30 years of winning players , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that it is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying di@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the sign of British flat racing for two decades .
it was ner@@ ven@@ tic .
a whole number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug @-@ ban .
three years ago , he had in early difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month semen , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his branch and return to its top shape .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said earlier that he wants to continue with his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian President Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin did not expect to release his Chief of Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a lot of years of the closest colleagues of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport affairs .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is said that Putin is arranged without the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of its obligations as Chairman of the Russian President . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the representative of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 , the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) , it was later log@@ ging and head of the head of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thank you for confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as head of State concerning the legislation and inspec@@ tions on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this stage was mysteri@@ ously made in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time , one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was responsible for Soviet intelligence service , K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request .
but despite the lu@@ dic@@ ts for the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially now before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once praised as a potential president , would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - came across to great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted at the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It &apos;s true that I had asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to put confidence for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his representative .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , which he trusted in the most .
once upon Putin , Ivan@@ ov had been estimated to be President of Russia after the second term of President of Russia , a third presidential term could be viol@@ ated against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near Allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became the president of three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement by his resignation .
Gibson , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , have prof@@ aned on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Queens@@ er@@ Cross@@ ing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ er@@ Cross@@ ing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four locking points of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 sl@@ ings .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
economist Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first who went across the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment at the building of the Queens@@ er@@ cross country .
we are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic size at this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of total bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , project director of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
at this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter stands for high @-@ proof high @-@ depth and deep @-@ construction .
after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the northern tip deck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or landing page .
this was reached by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled off at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
he@@ ats , because the toler@@ ances that the team works are tiny - on each side it was only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after she threw her fishing boat before an@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station landed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swim in safety while their boat moved further from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and stood the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already seen the boat out of its range , until we left the water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from 60 years and was found on a boat without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived aboard the coastal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness to be hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot@@ motor had an emergency stop@@ per , however , in the case of the Bo@@ ots of the Bo@@ ots of the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
heavy hurt - man stri@@ pped to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal stuff .
instead of the alcohol , dis@@ car@@ ded the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when they came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and in the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes in his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
that embra@@ ced his sister .
together with their livel@@ ihood , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her life .
on the road she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ endangered man .
when the two women once again gu@@ essed the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old is his sister to his side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ ger cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD performs a &quot; manual concept &quot; for the next rat@@ ern@@ ation .
but war is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to rest as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments may also arise in the stock .
however , the major issue of the town hall was , however , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build up with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to grow at least 10 percent of these areas , but as possible 20 per cent of the apartments are building as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions , will have to be financed and financed for incen@@ tives .
the problem , &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors a few regulations as possible .
the Left doesn &apos;t want to dissolve hard@@ ships for investors .
regardless of this , so viol@@ inist , h@@ ort a tigh@@ ten to the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more personnel is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will receive the skilled workers .
but the program does not fully understand : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how compar@@ es the loss of further around 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose support will run out in the next years ?
by 2020 alone it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the plann@@ er spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be rede@@ emed to be rede@@ emed by the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to take apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the West city .
at one stroke the problem viol@@ ates itself .
because in the West city run down the year @-@ end fri@@ ght .
around 1800 apartments could be found there again in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , housing construction companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the West city is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mixing .
a concentration of social guards in just a few districts shall not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must start with the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and child don &apos;t go out to play anymore , but rather , prefer@@ ring to spend their free time to spend on screens , has been compl@@ ains in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go there is to get people from the sofa and be more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities outdoors are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I am thinking of course on the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app based on characters which were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it was created a cartoon series , playing cards , and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture was the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smart phones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that were tra@@ ced with a GPS and , once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the bet@@ wi@@ an and le@@ ap@@ ing for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the release of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent each day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for increased performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
those who are regularly driving sports , reduces his chances to become cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that is fun to them .
thus , three pillars of health is covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new girl@@ friend@@ ships .
anyway , there are also sh@@ orten players who always have to complain about .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
a breakthrough has happened .
even if you could follow smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal , and the use will be recre@@ ated with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , and many people on the hunt will help to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is definitely immune to all that .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ ge@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team team A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ ev in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swe@@ eper during the single campaign for women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ winning title , and a total of the fifth , while they k@@ rep@@ el their reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all .
it broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was found in this moment .
this success makes it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought her sports for new heights :
in the last three years , Bil@@ es domin@@ ates their sport race - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ out of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final testing in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not back with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after selling gold and silver in the single campaign for women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday while at the farewell celebration of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i used as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on top of their long way to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
a part of their ground exercises - which included their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a training session in the gym hall , where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no more lost events in the summer of 2013 , a Sieg@@ is@@ eries that will hold so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily carried through two turns , the image dra@@ gged .
floating Bal@@ ks and Bo@@ ots - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating floor - and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her soft@@ ly as she expected her final eyes - a pure formation - and tears radi@@ ated on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision , who once described it in her collection book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke of Must@@ af@@ ina went .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capital employed by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ ted .
as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ old twe@@ et has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ case shot at music by car
according to police reports , on Thursday released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ age of Phoenix , while they were talking in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 when the car was par@@ ked in a drive , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of an adult victims .
the police pre@@ acher from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting of the investig@@ ator led the investig@@ ators to become a close look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks seven people and two were injured in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to manifest the evidence they have led to the conclusion that they were linked to the conclusion , and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died on site .
a witness told the police with that it was not unusual for her to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on the sho@@ ot@@ ings that resulted in an empty pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the triple murder and was assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ y@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most of the 6 year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its age group Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I create this not .
I don &apos;t create this .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
which is not true at all -- of course , one has dropped on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund can never see them under any circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of assistance .
Edmund could neither sit in cra@@ ck@@ ling until his third year , and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress .
he can run with assistance and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Edmund said for &quot; Please give me something ahead of them . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing languages , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not typical character language -- it says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund , and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ik@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how life that will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t really know .
I have been asked for a long time since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect she can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has been a hop@@ eless advice for mothers of babies with birth defects which caused by the c@@ ic@@ avirus were caused .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainfall , floo@@ ding on salvation in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainfall and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana en@@ forced the governor to call the emergency call on Friday . it will reck@@ on all Saturday about with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the tor@@ to@@ is flooded their sho@@ res and threatened with large floo@@ ding in extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Security Service .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards told that state officials standing in continuous contact with the local authorities and assistance to the con@@ greg@@ ations already on the way .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality had required ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service predic@@ ts that additional 3 @-@ 5 inches could fall to rain in this area .
in the South of Alabama a fl@@ ut@@ ment system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louisiana , will reach a record level after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many homes to the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ ward ag@@ grav@@ ated flood in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these are only flowing slowly in Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the E@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still pick people from the flood in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among those who were rescu@@ ed by glo@@ om@@ ers on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which normally lies more than 400 feet from his house , rise overnight by night .
he said that another boot@@ ees , who lives near , would have warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and po@@ uring the water and pushed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years where she lived there , never had seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he &apos;d be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency relief would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated to Friday .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread out &quot; quickly , &quot; since it continued heavy rainfall , and that authorities will continue to ev@@ ac@@ uation the ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , an observer was in the vicinity of Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was considerably su@@ cked through the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding the rescue of residents out of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching staff in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS @-@ affiliated station WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ated houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now flooded with them .
the Chief of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets allowed from the floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , Not@@ ices were set up to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads are provided because of the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the town administration .
this seems like a similar incident .
in the no@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy &apos;s Harrison Count@@ ess said that it was even ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday was reported to be flooded , but on Friday they were not reported .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per &apos;s value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ving sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police claims that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several fire@@ ab@@ uses including in the lung , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital at consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced from balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ chi@@ z the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was classified in a hospital as critical , and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ caster that he is expected to be read again .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people fired by German@@ town .
three men were shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old age .
one of the 29 year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy has been found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who found himself in a critical condition , reports the broad@@ caster .
the other two victims were not found in the car , and the police just determines whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could be .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently had come to a cross between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
patches for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , survived the crime scene .
it seems that it clearly acted to a constant struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the road , they were leg@@ ged .
so it seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided police ret@@ inal p@@ mann Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently checks , according to the surveillance video .
another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket near the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police is looking for a susp@@ icious .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present myself among the women &apos;s Olympic Games in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
firstly I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ists , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is Cath@@ o@@ lics , round , makes every proud .
this squ@@ ad finally reflects the United States .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , the number one was a Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
with the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad and che@@ ered America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of three @-@ fold world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won with an individual multi @-@ campaign for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we &apos;re experiencing the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gym categories throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four tur@@ ists in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a expensive sport and Turner first line in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who come up for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in weal@@ thy suburbs which can help business .
in these clubs , the Turner get their whole training and this is a dev@@ al@@ ous and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer von Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the tower .
we have to be inspired the con@@ greg@@ ations of Au@@ n countless , young girls , inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , making a more affordable and easy access gymn@@ asi@@ um training .
I have founded my Turn@@ halle Foundation of 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained by national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to provide high quality antenn@@ as to learn the possibility of learning from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of that crew to bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team gol@@ and thank you that so many young girls are motivated with a different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists would like to organise any further strikes after Jeremy would have rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggestion
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted in a vote , refused him .
in July , H@@ unt &apos;s plans revealed to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS was found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful .
the first assistant doctors should receive a new contract , which contains modifications to night and weekend work to improve the care of the ti@@ cking times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A comm@@ mitt@@ ees last night in a message with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have agreed to the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , in particular that it pre@@ heat the current staff crisis and fer@@ ment it to treat all doctors . &quot;
at just eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress will be made and time runs out .
efforts on the BM@@ A solution to solve disp@@ utes caused by the government to participate in the government &apos;s sake and sometimes on th@@ under@@ ous silence .
this was the word of a speaking that Jeremy H@@ unt had made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt must now act , lift the up and talk the concerns of assistance in Assi@@ stance . &quot;
should he not do this , so , in Assi@@ stance doctors have made clear that they are ready to carry further meetings .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ine@@ ations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were involved in order to cover doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better weekend re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Staff , called for assistant doctors to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working measures do not achieve a little , but are already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es answers the concerns about er@@ mund@@ ane and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers have hoped that this continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as an aston@@ ishment , flexibility in training , training vac@@ ations , mutual recognition of cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , training vac@@ ations , mutual recognition of teaching , education , health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 per day medicine after being recommended by the authorities , to submit more people for a longer period .
the t@@ inn@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine was administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of strokes or another heart attack .
according to the N@@ HS , the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
according to the N@@ HS , the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fet@@ ch material in the arter@@ ial walls which make bel@@ lows .
when the cover breaks down , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that leads the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when blood cl@@ ots solve , it can flow through the flow of blood flow and blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons , who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the UK company Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the name of N@@ ICE , which today has been published , recommends a 12 @-@ month ing@@ ray of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health Research Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , one quarter of all persons suffering a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing additional heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft recommendation is not recommended for this period .
Culture of Political &apos;s Political Affairs , election fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ishes
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a governmental report on corruption from office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to that widespread election fraud is ignored in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles inter@@ vening the police , election ob@@ servers and city houses to have evidence of electoral abuse on eth@@ nic@@ ity regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , which is now an ant@@ agon@@ isms of religious motivation , said that it should be allowed to protect police from the police , to set off turn@@ tables outside of voting cabins to protect voters .
he recommends that voters should conduct a document to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a voters must name only his name and address .
the report proposes , not removable ink on the fingers of a person when they leave their electoral voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
it demands that the press should have access to municipal records and decisions from non @-@ official funds or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not only serve to vote , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial ev@@ asion that goes down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special optional Court decided that the official mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should appear on the corrupt and illegal intern@@ ment of his Am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious emotions of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that there is the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ min@@ ation , in which one person cho@@ oses other .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the whole country .
he expressed particularly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ stain the electoral system , including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof has been attached that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose the El@@ der of El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ glad@@ bach background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a concern that ... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work in@@ discrimin@@ ating documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report adopted by Ther@@ esa May is also demanding the tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the voting rights for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask elec@@ tors in front of the choice after your ID .
not removable ink on the finger of a person when she has left her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person must be ensured that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic mail @-@ election .
prohibition that political activists deal with complete correspondence and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the powers to establish sec@@ rec@@ tions for poll@@ ing stations .
an amend@@ ment that establishes a charge of in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation under the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( referendum law in 1983 ) .
no photographer in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the constitu@@ ency stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to make sure that the staff will rule the rule that voters go alone into the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls beyond the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his representative to corrupt and illegal practices in illegal practices and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty of a number of reasons for reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; abor@@ tion controls &quot; of the city &apos;s electoral sector .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the tribunal in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country bears as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics are made this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , which has proved an impressive double successor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to hit gold fighting athl@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one may give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that runs on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympics projects that are more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in the ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger in the wheel railway , many people pointed out on the Internet as a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in the ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cover@@ tly .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave him to listen to his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;m doing it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be one of the most popular simil@@ arity between the British O@@ br@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her major , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to pass through as a double bond for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a speed higher : this user is convinced that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption acting
another one @-@ year comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ h , which has similarly heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal for the Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova market shows more than just the sun @-@ fired skin and blonde hair such as actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan spoke Adrian by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
powerful women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter User was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities .
theory in the space : according to this user , there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter @-@ User@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that hope is solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical . &quot;
indeed , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar facial form and eyes .
another popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , broad smile , resem@@ bles that of bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was switched off , when he finished the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ aff aff@@ el to his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; color &quot; could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as Mi@@ ef died as a pig .

the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , where many of him were talking about .
Twitter User did not return , when they heard how un@@ sensitive in Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you only present the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short period later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , recorded live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast on a floating output . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortunate formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times at the end of the people who had answered B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
comment@@ ators Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC led and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message out .
we regret it correctly , that these statements were made and , that it was possible to broadcast them .
yesterday we were able to ap@@ ologi@@ ze at our spectators on the show and our followers in the social media .
to establish a clear@@ er , Byron &apos;s comments are focused on the performance of swi@@ mmer and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequ@@ ately and an un@@ fortunate formulation . Byron does what he has said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald was arrested in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to support her as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for me to excuse me for the comment that I made after the gy@@ ms of women in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have taken care of the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not in her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no contemp@@ t , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;

the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went out to dress her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row , to sample sub@@ h@@ osen .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she mut@@ tered her , as she saw her , she moved back and put them back to the shelf again .
she continued walking and tried four pairs of under@@ h@@ osen in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who at the same time was in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under the under@@ wear , she moved back and left the business , without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales space , she took a couple of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , attracted their own shr@@ ub@@ es and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when she went out again , who didn &apos;t like her , since she put it into the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you did not feel it , and went out again and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone who observed someone - or to think about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent lives , said : &quot; as contra@@ dic@@ tory that someone would take sub@@ mis@@ ses at home , which had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff has tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - what &apos;s equally good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had an@@ gled and did not have washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect himself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms strikes
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a safer place for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to turn away with armed troops .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn around the sk@@ ewers .
when you turn back from behind , then you should turn your att@@ acker so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and take from the gun line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you strike your face with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the knee into the glue and rotate , while the att@@ acker is squee@@ zing pain together , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , take the weapon and rotate them , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
transfer the weight simultaneously to the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backward and make the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ um .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est part of your money - if you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eler Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for one guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller inter@@ cep@@ ted his immune system and worms of a serious test - taking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe .
the present@@ er and it@@ ator Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk dismissed his course on a Euro @-@ scho@@ oner , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse head of a draw@@ back and public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before leaving every object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going on .
but the experiment , which was filmed in the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , r@@ ins@@ ing the rinse head of a draw@@ back , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely disgu@@ sting , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on promoting Dar@@ mb@@ als and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he stretched out , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by travelling through the world , and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to washing dishes of toilets , the task introduced its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concern and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and sl@@ um@@ ps . &quot;
in the film , he was justified to his call .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample line showed a lumin@@ ometer of more than 4000 units .
compared with this , the lumin@@ ance speed will be freshly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse , after their L@@ umin@@ ometer numbers over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have a less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel il@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I &apos;ve found in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;ll stum@@ ble here , because it is inside disgu@@ sting here .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation .
the company equi@@ ps Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Battle , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating about watching and is simultaneously the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we made a crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings to the end that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide for more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he had asked for some of the things I had directed to le@@ cken , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to join them , and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m happy that we have recorded some of these dirty treats to film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of those surveyed , lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent reported that they have at least sometimes used products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroys the social flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a ozi@@ ale family left her social flat after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50.000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , they found the property of the apartment in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls are sha@@ ded holes , wooden floors were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y who works for the house management in Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing said that she fears that the apartment is no more to repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here , and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror , which had joined the family , in@@ timi@@ date with bases , abuse of hab@@ itable , drug abuse , drug dealers and excessive scre@@ aming , stre@@ aks and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the le@@ ase contract , got a arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate , in which drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floors were torn
neighbors said they had to fight on the street and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ etes it and her partner non@@ violent from the estate , after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to choose voluntary .
the dol@@ ences were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that her life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; you didn &apos;t stum@@ ble around anybody . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was terrible .
the countless times we &apos;re saying the police here , are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that it had the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , called the police in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the left side of the municipal house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it ab@@ hor@@ red the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of her family as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult , and their deeds had to be horri@@ fic in their neighbours .
I appreciate all of the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that cour@@ age@@ ously passed on us and have made us the information provided .
I hope that this development will contribute to some neighbours , and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that left in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the household authorities will now have waste disposal , which surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis and gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of fin@@ ed after the owner of a drug in the class B had found guilty .
they claimed that the money spent a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room@@ walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti by gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that she will del@@ ate rent@@ ers , who do not keep themselves to the order arrangement .
Angela C@@ row was distributed by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with that the del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other rent@@ ers , who do not comply with the laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can conduct without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been off@@ ended by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of air force laid an incredible assault flight
the Air Force sent that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted on that there was no risk of safety .
this was the moment when the k@@ ang@@ ent tourists start to get in panic after a ti@@ lled Jet above a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tan@@ gible proximity beyond the sun@@ rises on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers go up when they were understand@@ ably , concerned about the noise of the excess ge@@ aring works without beginning to see what caused by the clouds to them .
the incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane arrived from the darkness and incredible deeply flew
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply they had to fly , that this was the only possibility to recognize them .
the nar@@ r@@ ator said that the jet had a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility conditions in the proximity of the surface fires , however , the Air Force insi@@ sted on that the safety was at any time endangered .
area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people were killed on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today gave to the fact that the pilot had to fly through the conditions - strong fog and fire - so deeply they had to fly as deep as its view .
the plane was located on a training flight , where pilot &apos;s fishing boats had to identify part of the exercise

with the date eleven successes of the record winner is the record winner in this applicant .

Donald Tr@@ ump grants to ″ massive issues ″ in election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive car@@ ef@@ ulness , even in traditional federal states to h@@ end their majority .
Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now existed weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment in which the normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after 16 Riv@@ als has thrown out of the race in its own republi@@ can camp , the doubts start to the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
guilt : false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ able
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were similar .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance to which republi@@ can candidates are common in the state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ t : &quot; as I have done so far . &quot;
and sh@@ ew : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he do nothing more different than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it &apos;s not rich for him on the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this was fine , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump must have threatened to split funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better demand values .
instead of whose wants to climb the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the Congress more strongly than the arms .
Olympia : thirteen dec@@ eit at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar commission on the case .
Ken@@ ias athletes threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud control at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee informed promp@@ tly to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar commission to investigate the case .
an Ken@@ yan function@@ ary has informed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ buyer F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this is the team @-@ line Ken@@ ias has been reported by D@@ oping control systems .
the IA@@ AF world federation around the case is searched for information about the case to ri@@ gor@@ ges its investigation , an IA@@ AF speaker with .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will receive an assessment , &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal were released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ ias boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athl@@ ete , which stood on the list for the training control of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics President Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio games .
he is supposed to have informed against cash payments of his country over upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was reportedly captured on his return at the airport of Nairobi .
in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special observation at the IO@@ C for a long period of time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio games , unusual before the Rio games has been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the vis@@ ier .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti D@@ oping Agency had committed a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose d@@ oping com@@ b@@ ating form are associated with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the championships for athletes of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , ARD will always be imposed again , that in Kenya d@@ oping means to be easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian Athle@@ tics .
thereby it could be demonstrated that this sport is widespread and systematically ex@@ pressing .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then exp@@ elled from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salz@@ burger Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan orchestra Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older incar@@ n@@ ate Maria .
she remembers her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as personality would be .
she tells her in her song : &quot; I produced the Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I produced in Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is smart , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Romans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for her opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with you .
she is a monster of funding .
and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such an enormous opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . McKin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ smus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we have gone the refugees at that time , the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York City didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same issues , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school maid , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned their death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria several weeks ago .
it was assumed that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
the Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after the family after her family , after she had the war to leave the war and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved to go into a war zone - people ever to take this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London climbed into a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
sult@@ anas &quot; family has been told that she has married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton will stick to the Supreme Court &apos;s case as a candidate for the Supreme Court .
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton nominated Chief Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next president will be elected president Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia at the Supreme Court .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects to select from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a speaker by Rei@@ d said later that he did not speak to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate he .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clin@@ t team would not care for ag@@ itation with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .

he also noted , Donald Tr@@ ump is not suitable for the presidency .
bats intends to get nu@@ di@@ ments for &quot; women and men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970 @-@ year Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous nude people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for its N@@ U mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us this year that his nude magazine of classic school play@@ boys distingu@@ is@@ hable , since &quot; Playboy was for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical neck , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to the Cal@@ endars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will be able to participate in this project because it &apos;s a wonderful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open cart call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish town@@ ship pays for mass curse
&quot; who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on rough suit@@ cases , &quot; says the disc@@ ern@@ ing of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialog and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in short , the Kurdish congregation of Germany pays for a short term of tens of thousands of protection , from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the ch@@ and@@ s@@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the harsh action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish congregation of Germany expects a mass curse to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I take with tens of thousands of people in Turkey , with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime continued to fight the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already passed over Kurdish high bur@@ gs with pen@@ alties that 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run .
after the f@@ abled pl@@ ush , another sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added .
many are going to re @-@ start in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff lam@@ ents the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic towns .
there@@ with Erdo@@ gan will raise the transfer back to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been ex@@ terminated or marketed already in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government demanded that the federal government is as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; was held against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement is also feared the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition leaders .
the fire mark@@ edly as Gü@@ len pendant destroyed teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics in professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on rough suit@@ cases , by the way , also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , leader of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialog and education , the world . &quot;
like the newspaper referring to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks have already reported the largest group of political persecution recognized in Germany before the put@@ sch .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus just under 29 per cent of all as well recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , do not find themselves those of war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum in accordance with the Basic Law are only politically , therefore by the state of government , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won nothing from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the country &apos;s Day .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
until 2021 , the Parliament election will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
the summer holidays , heat and land w@@ rest@@ ling do not occur until now .
the locals who are to be persu@@ aded by the voters are on vacation .
most holi@@ day@@ makers , who are on the country , are on the island of Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not allowed to choose the country .
there are practical problems : in the holiday , hel@@ pers are able to infl@@ ate the posters , infl@@ ating air ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and pour out voices at the end of the vote .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has under@@ gone an election campaign close to the people over themselves .
the hot stage , when you can tell at all , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , like heavily new@@ comer AF@@ D , and what remains is left at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ posters .
he travels across the country , spread roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , as it did already his legendary artist Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
apart from that , Seel@@ ing has gotten cold feet , so ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel gives blame to the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is probably going to cost him a beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time on the right place .
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel to large expl@@ or@@ ations , Merkel called the German Parliament in the Nor@@ theast Latvia .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , was recently held in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is too no one to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North @-@ East CD@@ U elim@@ in@@ ates the usual election campaign in market areas and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this , Kok@@ ert says , plays only one &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you need the base the base , that it must be very strict , once again , to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are on the left side of the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any thing in the territory of the country .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ Ele@@ ction Kok@@ ert to his fellow soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : Dor@@ o@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game is , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD in a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys , S &amp; D Group was last updated with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election the SPD gained some 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , small party with seven percent in p@@ olls , could create the leap into the country &apos;s tag .
they are making a modern virtu@@ e , a modern virtu@@ e , and put them in the internet for their election campaign .

B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : catering equipment suffer from lock
at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible work , start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end up only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are omni@@ vor@@ ous praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff , from the jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the building site could be moved to the half @-@ time scheduled to the south , until the end of October is supposed to be all ready .
he will also be praised for the work of those who are responsible , even if it comes to the establishment of master@@ ing rides .
since the construction site is emigrated on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was eliminated and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation inside the place has been relaxed .
citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic to the place seems to be back .
&quot; there was partially significant complaints , &quot; says the main office of the refurb@@ ishment &quot; administrative project Florian King . &quot;
the residents of the brook @-@ road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sought routes and rather than the sign@@ age .
what led to that man@@ cher truck was fran@@ ked into residential areas .
since the speed limit has not been kept , the municipality strengthens the Mess@@ r@@ ust of M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there was significant over@@ passing , &quot; says King that made himself a place over the situation .
there have been two to three per minute .
the express@@ way was on the road with 77 hours kilometers in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment in them has led to net sales , each one asks to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has less to do so for other companies , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decrease &quot; but also gives an impression that , of course , &quot; the running hood is missing . &quot;
at the strongest are the local roads along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
that is exist@@ ential @-@ threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
there were the customers of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue fluctu@@ ated in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road planning have thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politicians would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the inn will benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B . now they must also do the dis@@ advantages , which result in the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled .
with all gri@@ ps , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its inn will continue .
after all , family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
that other regul@@ ars are often subject to the complicated traffic management of less frequently , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also very different .
after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the end of the renovation work .
despite crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its inn in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of work , that &apos;s been brutal .
constantly in the name of the terrorist terrorism , the laws shall be screw@@ ed to laws .
according to the recent proposals , the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what has a job status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner tell all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security box .
they don &apos;t want to call anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I too took part in this too .
but as the Minister of the Interior , he was on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presented his conclusions to the safety in the Republic .
but these are the more extensive .
some have been announced , announced , announced that a new security Authority should take care of encrypted communication , is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU direc@@ tives to passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies are also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second call for proposals that have not been able to do so far with the SPD : he wants to avoid sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grants the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demanding nothing , which have no chance at the coalition partner anyway .
some new ideas will present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they are partly in itself : he plans fast method for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to shift people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted targeted towards the country , should declare their smart phones and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
at Dul@@ ces for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some more worse than so far - such , the crimes are going to go away or refuse their papers to mis@@ use their identity .
some of them is political and legally .
some even more un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - for example - in the im@@ balance of mo@@ il , for example - raises the question : what does that actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subject of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak in saying that the assass@@ in of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
moreover , many people in view of high refugee troubles are concerned about security .
and things that enter@@ tained people in deeply , could not let themselves be cl@@ utter@@ ed in election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
just the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
on the subject of inner safety , the Union and SPD are increasingly vulnerable .
in the past days there was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ chy dispute over the Federal police &apos;s equipment , then on a security policy collection for some Unions of the Interior , who also demand a bur@@ ial ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is bo@@ asting here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return from the double pass he doesn &apos;t stop anything .
we have ma@@ stered the debate in Germany .
re @-@ opened , it is not useful .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban it concerns constitu@@ ent concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself .
there &apos;s a lot in the things to worry about .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing an internal security subject .
party Management Sig@@ mar Gabriel is sign@@ alized only a time of convers@@ ing and saying : &quot; the SPD are ready to talk about everything , which contributes to the security further . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
despite diesel engines , the suppliers rise in the world .
but not in all markets it is running around .
with the recall reaction , there are confusion about a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ sport can be further developed despite its many brands and well @-@ run markets despite its many brands .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and thus loads up the total sale of sales , like that in D@@ ax recorded business .
the VW , in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales rose 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries decreased by almost a sixth year .
Prime Minister Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est numbers from July to less on two sales days less in Europe .
moreover , in some core markets , it has been given a market restra@@ int in some key markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote have suffered from the EU to ex@@ ert a speaker .
in the US , where the exhaust gas is first escal@@ ated , there is also a Min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the predominantly affected house @-@ brand of Lower Saxony goes further to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales of Fred Kap@@ pler was further instructed from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen sold 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software qu@@ gast@@ ric tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls some 2.5 million wag@@ ons to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament VW , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power is no deteri@@ oration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the customer service to the customer , after re@@ armament a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cause of legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen launches its customers now a guarantee for the equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have confirmed this last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Justice .
from the Ministry of Transport , it has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has accomplished the requirements of my investig@@ ating Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power , after re@@ armament does not take any deteri@@ oration , and remain unchanged in the relevant vehicle values .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in company travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the opportunity to come back for example a half year after the conversion with a motor damage to a workshop - and to return this to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important to avoid that in any case of customer interest , it is important for any other damage that has nothing to do with the su@@ cking sc@@ andal , with respect to any warranty , as it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the concept &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demanded of rich austerity in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ note Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers , which par@@ ked 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily bonds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single case and doesn &apos;t see a signal : regular austerity would have to be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks have to pay money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and company customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been taking 40 million euros for ger@@ au@@ mer time , that could be lifted from one day on the other and could not use it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at the central bank account and may cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every one million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the cost he goes further after the forgiveness principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash just in the T@@ res@@ cent of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank should be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t want to be the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
just a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
Germany &apos;s cooperative association declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy track in ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
they alone contribute to &quot; Oper@@ ating economically - permanently possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their charges for account guidance , credit cards or transfers .
with interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made headlines in 2014 with their sk@@ ate bank branch .
Michael Kem@@ mer , the principal leader of the banking association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , in addition , the competition in Germany is much too strong in banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a cliff that has a wealth of wealth a wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they get free money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ ver , Kre@@ m@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , established in 1911 .
in the region well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepren@@ eur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no further banks known to the cooperative association for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negatives with the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and it dro@@ ves the migration of investors to the competition .
customers in Germany will not miss this in width .
destination : who purchases sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men love middle age plates .
before you have to comment on the comment@@ ator to over@@ see him under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ p@@ seud@@ onym @-@ aged ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the resur@@ gence of records of sound panels is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the unity of physical objects , but attributed to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all prec@@ urs@@ ors according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer .
it is also not a hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older platform buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on television would follow me the camera , while I wear a modest gray suit , a modest gray suit , and a modest gray suit before I stand to hold my hands and make something more determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let us take a close look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart has so@@ ared in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were based , there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , by Sister Ray ( data of data : two young women , three men aged middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men of middle age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I appreciate it , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these Schall@@ platten , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed home ) , dress the walls of his own room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy records , which he sold and again sold items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; many things I buy , are of the late 60s , early &apos; 70s that was published when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had to do with them to buy her , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and we would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my master .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he hits the You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and will take care of buying their old records .
from the talks which I have led , people usually have emp@@ tied their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records back , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to the App@@ endi@@ ces of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to recognise that turn@@ tables are a soo@@ thing community of pe@@ ers .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payments system .
some turn@@ tables feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound sites , of objects , happy ju@@ gen@@ ders .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to address spiritual .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff from an flat stack .
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people purchased a record last month they haven &apos;t listened to .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a plate , do not have a turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ ot@@ ted through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead &apos;s record , so I &apos;d like to put them into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening .
more productive , less musi@@ kl@@ ine .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who come slowly in slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I was cleans@@ ing .
there are pairs around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women middle @-@ aged people .
even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ates from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customers .
none of them looks quite lon@@ ely , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are badly det@@ ectable if one stands for someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around in the business for a few minutes and consider the variety of records for sale .
it is more a man@@ ne@@ quin bum@@ pers than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so collecting plates are not a real option , says it .
it will cost much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a fell si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how I am to explain - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holder : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit the note that jeans Hot@@ pants are to gra@@ ven , I observe a group of young teenage girls , who group to group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall filled with Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to put them up .
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also this is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they have at least in turn@@ around in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , turn@@ around and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not through the bum@@ pers through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by records while starting the ga@@ ze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who stands over the shoulders of old men of middle @-@ aged people .

French court re@@ jects offer about demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp .
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live in the jungle .
in a trial of the week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be to break down 72 temporary businesses , selling cigarettes to energy drinks , selling hairdres@@ ser and tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy , which would not be paid to taxes , and that a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the nation@@ ally supported union and other groups are not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also carried out that the temporary businesses and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people that give the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely feasi@@ ble . &quot;
the judge Jean François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a lot more important role , than people who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places that was threatened by the low @-@ mor@@ sel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is generally used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as an advice for asylum application for the hundreds of protection of protection , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closing &quot; for this children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organisations help to Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers throughout the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must adjust to the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash systems are tested to manage the temp@@ o heal@@ thier .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on the motorway construction or to gentle bridges with temporary temp@@ o , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary gl@@ itter for resp@@ ecting the speed limit .
a lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ate .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be encrypted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be collected over several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as through @-@ departure times after time , driving strips and vehicle class are also closely monitored .
in the high @-@ prop@@ elled state , one can move the trailer to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer hook .
so that it is not simply ge@@ ared , he is lowered to the measuring mode so that the wheels in the pan @-@ pan and by the way also dis@@ appearing outer sleeve .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities were also fl@@ ashing with the new technique : recently France has re@@ ordered 100 units , according to an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain pic@@ ks silver at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday night at a broken stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stage in Rio .
Fiji announced a master@@ class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , pres@@ sures , liner run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - Britain fourth at that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they stroke New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals in the same day could fall back in the final day .
but regardless of it , it has struck a 15 @-@ man team in top shape using this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , former head of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this f@@ lap will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji had a wonderful effect and left the attacks G@@ BS from fun off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in , as if one would run in driving co@@ aches . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went down in the corner .
another four minutes season , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he turned into .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly used the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle Drop from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal but it has only stopped thinking .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua l@@ ete a touch @-@ down corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new album since repe@@ ating it and there was still about a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ sides by further weak Tac@@ cl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still being se@@ eded .
it is the way it is .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and completed the fixed gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant cli@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton launched a trial for GB , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South African , whose fans sang , f@@ laun@@ ts and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame bet the i @-@ door clo@@ cks with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and cr@@ ushing out the GB of cr@@ ushing out in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK urged South Africa to a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late @-@ time tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony in the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thereby the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by combat with the cancer of the trainer for ru@@ d@@ der win
there will be no larger gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve those who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the confes@@ sion that were at the rod , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Trainer Robin Williams was ever present when she ru@@ sted the second Olympi@@ ad in the two without tax wife , the first women in the history of the British sport that put up such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th un@@ qualified use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete that reflects on the surface with the elegance of s@@ warf , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind each Gold in Ru@@ dern there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent hel@@ pers that make the difference and there was no more comfortable than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could be treatment in early 2014 , out of season , could begin , which held the break to a minimum , if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to go better again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was at the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said some steps would be sufficient .
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ fertility of the Vic@@ tory , their first thoughts about Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning , thus spent a bit more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much to me , how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , hence a massive Thank you . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person to trainer or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make something ra@@ bies .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take time for a year before making decisions on his future .
there must appear next week at a wedding on your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the water association &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ung &quot; , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired .
the association is considered a &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ly exemplary . &quot;
a small fishing drinking water supply unit as a model for large water manufacturers .
so it was some time ago in the original box in a paper by the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken comp@@ lied with the meantime .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group is &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in a forced employee , 28 years of age as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water supply of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and contains 32 locations and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
member states are the church Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remembered that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was employed in 1985 as a water@@ bed and has already been appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ ers .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work about office and maintenance activities , the budget plann@@ er , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency tours at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and compensation in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the share of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations again , because water may cover life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio she praised Gö@@ llers faith@@ less , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart attacks for its water purpose and he has lived in the water @-@ purpose , and it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he must present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group to nit@@ rate from the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller also praised Aqu@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a devoted scar@@ ce .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ structure and re@@ structure of the association .
the greatest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the frac@@ ture in the high container in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night also had to work , so that the towns with water could be supplied .
at once , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained at once because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with battles .
the management of drinking water supplies were handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who kicks up the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago around - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corriere della Sera &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago did come well and learn to learn private in New York where it &apos;s the best therapist .
&quot; to give an example , if I ask him something which is two years back when I sang at the Mail@@ änder Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .
but he is the most happy man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ k@@ os connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man is shooting at the Dan@@ gerous
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man passed away on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner and wounded them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself by us and stated his life companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , after him will be publicly f@@ law@@ ed .
in the meantime , Sven S. could have been travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ cher .
meanwhile the police have published a photograph of him .
it is , however , a couple of years old .
meanwhile , the man we@@ ars a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with him , so the police .
who Sven S. sees to call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship at . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck I did not want to make any information to the ather@@ ap@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims . however , they confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a killing of killing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we say no more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to ey@@ e@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the risk @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional costs in millions height .
financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the green power supply , are from the table .
it remains in the liberation of renewable energy sources at the inventory of the so @-@ called Own production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the past two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission originally planned to start the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the blast furnace for their own consumption to the K@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry association , the steel industry revised additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if generators be replaced in the steel plants , all an EEG lev@@ y is 20 percent .
but this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed at the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on the self @-@ creation .
with this , the status quo will largely be established in the previous regulation .
special meaning have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann declared in Frankfurt also on the reform of the emission margin &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied further , when the world @-@ largest producer of China led to the weak@@ est domestic demand of mass@@ aging steel to the global market .
European manufacturers cast Chinese steel concerts as p@@ umping .
during this spring , the situation has something relaxed .
for one show , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ orter effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have hung up .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price re@@ covering is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last once the prices were stagn@@ ant .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp has finally wanted to close the works of single works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel manufacturer remains cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a fine figure of 3.4 million tons of less steel than in the previous year , like the Economic Association steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity delivered back to the second month .
since the beginning of the beginning , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association is calculated in the coming months thanks to an improved order volume in increasing emissions .
community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good
the singing ancest@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she took the compartment music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , joy@@ ful and more lively , she says .
in addition , she does something good for her health and spirit .
for singing , coming from several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League .
most Seniors sing in choir and sharing the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular mer@@ ging , Seniors social contacts can establish and maintain .
for often social and family structures in the age of , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn and organize themselves to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this exercise sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breath .
whoever calls his lungs regularly , is also not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to receive the sound of the voice in the age , singing an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz stated by the Federal Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs during older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth age .
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melodies , people have settled in a long @-@ lying events .
when singing , head also requires special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and to concentrate on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cog@@ nitive challenge .
just older people , who live alone , do not just prac@@ tise on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one finds singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show itself : if I am long for something , I will better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby you should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people who hears it when a sound is going on ?
looking for the right offer , Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens have various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the world &apos;s acquain@@ t@@ ance in a senior ench@@ anting , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
who would like to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or the church .
many veter@@ ans will also be found on the Internet .
if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors will ask for help with internet re@@ treats .
if you want to sing , you should necessarily connect to a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats are sensitive as a cat on scre@@ ams of young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the rowing of cat bab@@ ys grown to adult animals .
to their surprise , the male didn &apos;t let the male cold - however , in contrast to the female , they beha@@ ved alike .
female cats may recognize the heritage of cat bab@@ ys at the ch@@ ew of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on the lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens which have found themselves in great need , as scientists from the medical medical university and medical University of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males also respond to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ths of less and strongly er@@ ra@@ ining young are either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the biolog@@ ist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ie with the ur@@ gency of their assistance was different .
a total of nine adult males and eight cavi@@ ties were observed from the livestock farming .
they were played for a rod of little ones , taken for three minutes from the Wur@@ f@@ box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ aming of stronger bo@@ b , which were highly frequ@@ ented .
the researchers retain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , did react to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ vel@@ ed faster to the speakers when this calls of the very er@@ ra@@ ined k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male didn &apos;t react at all , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist .
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
in fact , some studies showed that women had been sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey during the pro@@ longed foot@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
he is accused of being a terrorist group member .
the first football match takes place once again after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .
in July , after the arrest of the insur@@ rection in July , the government accused the everyday life of norm@@ ative should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which makes responsible for the coup attempt .
the cup of football is also not being done before the football .
the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against the former star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
according to the latter , the South of America was accused of being accused of a terrorist group in the United States .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be responsible for the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
although the initial state is still valid for 90 days until October , actually , this was actually the life of most Turks , but as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public places in the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
many fans of the working class Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the president .
but the Gro@@ s of the Turks , however , united with dramatic experiences in the history , is the strict re@@ jection of military put@@ ties .
there even themselves the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ic@@ tas .
at Po@@ em winner &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be back up to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Köl@@ ner increased its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and 9 templates in all the competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; rejo@@ iced : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trop@@ hy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will also say early in the Europe League .
in the south of Li@@ g it was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win anything .
&quot; we made it and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th season as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher , the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year olds .
on this occasion , the AC Florence had only posted an agreement with the agreement and Bes@@ ic@@ tas to return to the coup attempt to return for the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario must come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

others over@@ took lightweight athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio for medals .
the theme D@@ oping defines the headlines in Rio Olympics as before the headlines .

it was a dramatic scene : with a watched smile , she was still in the hall , and prov@@ oked it with her appearance .
when fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a junk@@ yard .
but there are also many other athletes who go to the Olympic Games despite d@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here &apos;s an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in Athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for d@@ oping times ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his b@@ ann the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and se@@ ven@@ fold world championship had to sit on a six month lock after taking the ing@@ es@@ ying of the pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .

Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly and was imprisoned for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m was closed in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months .
a means for penis enlargement was been responsible , for@@ ged Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres from the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ole , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athl@@ ete , many medals were subsequently detected afterwards .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Championship title nine years later , after it was found in case of testosterone d@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ oping d@@ oping and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone de@@ contamination .
he also acknowledged Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 due to a verdict of the International Sport Court of CA@@ S .

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al Dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand arise with the woman in contact , said spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered inter@@ sections and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left again .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und voyage they planned for early September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ uk@@ et and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g , and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also Austrian national citizens .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is available in relation to permanent contact with local authorities , as well as bar@@ bells .
in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday night .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday night there were two jumps too high , and according to the authorities , another person was killed .
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also enrolled in the morning in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police officers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bomb which killed an urban staff .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explo@@ sives have gone into air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
eventually det@@ on@@ ations required in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on to the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , whose name was .
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; said armies , Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday night before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself as possible moti@@ fs - it is probably the act of the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to detect a patterns that is typical of the bom@@ bers of the country in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather likely that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received secrets in the past days of sec@@ rec@@ y indications in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact date and the places .
yet be un@@ clear what group is behind the attacks .
the police for@@ gave their officials to the country , security around the important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment district .
in Thailand , there are increasingly smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not opposed to tourists .
Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after reason of reason , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to necessarily lead the orders of Thai security agencies .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) donated to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations is not necessary to take part in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) used for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversial referendum on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this dre@@ amt of the military has an impact on the military in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , holds himself good to have the Kingdom again to stability and order .
however , it did not manage the military to get a grip for years in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
almost a year ago in Bangkok we were killed in a attack on a popular Hindu @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is in the vis@@ ier of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several regional offices , the Con@@ stitu@@ zer in the Con@@ federation have set up the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts towards the freedom of democratic fundamental laws , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , immigrants will be de@@ fam@@ ed by Islamic faith or the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of groups with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ ticul@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity . &quot;
constitutional shel@@ ters in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ fication . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely matched with the federal government .
groups like the &apos; identity Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional law .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an active advertising for its own .
propaganda is supposed to appeal the people emotional .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in particular .
this is dangerous .
last of several federal states , there were reports about contacts of the &quot; identi@@ fying &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
they said he did not have knowledge .
for the constitutional safety , contacts of this species could only be relevant as from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the AF@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes its goal and is so extrem@@ ist .
so the decisive factor is whether such persons have an influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee information , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there was the Group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that other legal group group@@ ings or small groups constitute the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee abuse , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m .
however , a clear or European control of jus@@ tic@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
then , Ma@@ ate concerned about that many sur@@ fac@@ tions came to the account of people , who did not have entered into the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the crime susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminal , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed off@@ ences which have previously been politically in@@ different , or , for example , CD@@ U , SPD , or left , who have become radic@@ alised with right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used as an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world records the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the clip was selected .
in the social networks Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finishes his seat with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and reserved the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted attention of international media .
why did the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special launch by the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ tly different countries .
as in Eth@@ op@@ ia , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname did the round .
some media used it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; inspired him in a rebellion against him .
his time he beat only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ isti@@ l , there was no role played .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the eel &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i ran for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete for 100 metres of fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
sorry , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old met for eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

if the election has nothing to become US President , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .

if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be either folding or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in an telephone interview with the US television sen@@ ders CN@@ BC .
if it &apos;s not rich for him on the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said .
so he called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was formed within his party .

in view of the last bad GfK figures , each shareholder &apos;s shareholders will eventually be un@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with the BMW &apos;s case , it would be the same as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ mi@@ um@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
an accident involving 43 senior citizens were injured as a passenger car on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ phone ( County Aur@@ i ) eight people were injured .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade their details according to an opposite le@@ aster , which is partly on the opposite way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six emergency ambul@@ ances and emergency medical cars came to an accident on the state road 2 .
the last travelers were brought back from a regular bus bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ophone neighborhood of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel business .
the investig@@ ators demanded the most experienced and possible witnesses to report at the police .
the fee per cubic metres of waste will be available from 1 October 2016 for the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ or@@ b@@ l 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will then increase later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a sleep@@ y calculation , the san@@ itation price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget was found by the county office Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that for these se@@ wage plant covers .
the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to protect the assets to operate the facilities .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from the Wel@@ th@@ igh@@ ter , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg are going to interv@@ ene deeper into the pur@@ se .
the ag@@ it@@ iner@@ ary increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed a new escal@@ ating of the fees for the se@@ wage plant of the market community .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 were also overweight and covers from the previous calendar period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gra@@ vings increased by Schmidt therefore that there are a relatively small waste disposal at all three se@@ wage systems , which runs between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , due to the low distribution situation , for example , expenses for necessary repairs decreased by several thousand Euros .
the se@@ wage rise in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation period in all three facilities not last due to its age of re@@ juven@@ ation and repair applications in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and opp . nearly 20 years .
Schmidt proves that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by a mechanical ventilation system .
at the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ th@@ est , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and when the first se@@ wage plant had to be put up after almost 20 years of operation , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge has to be fitted and an additional aer@@ ating possibility to be able to keep the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expendi@@ tures came to the continued cooperation and maintenance costs , which are to be considered in the new Kal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 is still clearly below the current level .
stone houses well made that during low water san@@ itation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
in this case , Schmidt added to the market assembly of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plant over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned investments will continue to be prec@@ eded by stone houses on Dur@@ ation , especially since the supply of water @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be wi@@ red because it is a shared facilities .

snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties on such a way that is already adjacent to Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ amed , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all of the Mis@@ in@@ itte get to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have taken criticism in the past where they were accused of being propag@@ ated by the app Black@@ face gra@@ zing or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week a filter made a filter , which gave them sl@@ ot@@ ch , false teeth and ev@@ ap@@ sed che@@ eks , they called some critic a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy was referred to a larger problem , that the company has vers@@ atility .
the news and dis@@ g@@ ust have been widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ tive that the rac@@ ism have experienced , the filter re@@ minded of cl@@ ums@@ y c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .

Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural proud dra@@ gons .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference facilities up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in their hands .
and snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in terms of race as their older anti@@ d@@ ders - could expect to expect sensi@@ bility .
if one of the snap@@ shots are a picture , it is much more difficult for one user , &quot; so it &apos;s much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineers for the medium , decided to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account , and asked others to do the same .
in an attachment for medium and in a phone interview she said that they don &apos;t think that there was a lack of diversity in the integration practices of snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she has no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that is largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for diversity of its workforce , and refers to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there are Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsibility , which focuses on under@@ estimated population groups and focused on internal integration events .
Z@@ hu , in turn , said that she will be closed your Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military conduct for@@ ged ISIS intelligence information , Committee of Congress festival
military members of the United States Central Command change@@ ably altered information in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions locally , an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of the Republican member states , secret service providers and military staff , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command intelligence analysts , which reported their ass@@ essments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
Central Command , short of C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message of intelligence information , typically ab@@ hor@@ ted by high level Cent@@ Com , have drawn regularly a posi@@ ti@@ ate picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it had the actual conditions locally , and were consistent positive as an analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , firm .
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct clu@@ es that government tips have given orders to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ zing the pressure from their pre@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Muslims already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ second city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , there &apos;s so much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the mid @-@ year 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the re@@ direc@@ tives of Central Command to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations are continued .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the General Department of Defence in Defense .
Democratic members of the news conference was adopted on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republican Task Force &apos;s Republican Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com established a superf@@ ici@@ ally restricted process for the creation of Isi@@ l and Iraq &apos;s security services , &quot; was the highest @-@ day Democrats Group , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of rec@@ ti@@ fying reports , &quot; ab@@ used mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence on an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in respect of a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported of investigations by the General Con@@ stitu@@ tions of the Pentagon , which were recorded by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , published in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General Foreign Minister is still underway .
but he also noted that &quot; experts sometimes have considerable opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Intelligence and the Defence Ministry welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have taken re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year has raised the question , when President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis areas .
more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , as an Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , who was writing a scrip@@ ture on how the then government of many analysts only saw a small crew in Iraq and had little time on it to make thoughts about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker decided to conclude that the government &apos;s statements received no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refin@@ eries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this realization has not been published , but the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ ur@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins a fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American F@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , it knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are similar in their group with Britain on the first place , which remains unbe@@ aten in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will take place on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will receive the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ placed Holl@@ ings will take a little longer out of the way that lead the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising host in their success story , four years after completing the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Team of the USA , the youngest in the history of this team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which she went to her and her team .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ horse in London , which we have now .
we have t@@ opped the ru@@ d@@ ding completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the se@@ am .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and kept the match lasted from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it took a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and ble@@ t the ball to the US to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff itself , which will protect from the bracelet for swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athletes .
you cannot place the TV , read a newspaper reading or listen to your neighbours in the queu@@ e in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of women with dimples , would have been very well received under these well @-@ known names that would be sent to Prime Time , being built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV commerci@@ als , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , out of Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade there are sports species that are not generally accepted : air@@ pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may it reign long .
but if I want to make sure arguments for my particular lovers , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that there is a Olympics .
this could be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the United States sent athletes to the competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had an athl@@ ete that made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has some outer side char@@ ms , partly because it sounds for an un@@ enligh@@ tened ear , suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as which sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a refreshing enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mor of his never to end s@@ wollen cl@@ alls - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and divers , the two sports that combines them essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging victorious jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and need a row of falling movements ( rotating , hollow and o@@ tos ) before they landing at the feet .
according to official Olympics , they are evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ standing athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in the Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue in their quest for gold , qu@@ icker , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go back and down , down@@ wards and down to the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but in the television broadcast also another cave goal : the world or the Olympic sensor .
the targeted scatter@@ ing is no@@ bel , admi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up an audience .
but it is also what I felt as a little ti@@ res@@ ome of these games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go to the top , then down@@ wards , then easily upwards .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves enter the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only .
the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ ons of Women are held on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise at 13.00 .
NBC , the final install@@ ment will disappear as part of an afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that probably will probably over@@ see the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the loss of consciousness can only be achieved through the An@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the objec@@ tion@@ fication of male athletes - as suggested by The Wall Street Journal , according to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his home , new fan@@ base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an Affili@@ ate of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , beat on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that very poor prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia straight forward to breaking ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid business alliance with an rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government shook the country and expand into more areas .
last week thousands of people fall on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the Government &apos;s response was inde@@ b@@ ted according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen shot dead un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
the main videos of protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety experts suggest young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are closely together with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in considerable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby dis@@ sidents were turned into silence .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian province .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints , that cover everything from the soil usage to the worms in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after a successful election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this z@@ un@@ chy , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced on the last few years , could benefit from turbul@@ ence and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess should explo@@ de in the surface of H@@ ink@@ u@@ ck@@ el@@ ns under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian states were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter , which they are in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ian states that they were gathered together to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ics in Ethiopia , among others .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ron@@ es , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Eth@@ op@@ i@@ ens mainly in Christian up@@ countries , in politics and economy , while they have exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and living in flat lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair , by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly ver@@ ed in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special en@@ voy to edit opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians of new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ clear reasons to increase the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray Region of North America , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government and were apparently stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ cia , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that period of turbul@@ ences went relatively fast .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ aries , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intention of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly common in the social media .
analysts say that protests the US and other Western allies bring in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ fly on the neighboring Somalia , even though they were recently announced that she had closed this basis .
while the West wants to support democracy , he does not want his associate in a volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ emig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his asser@@ tion Obama to be established &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the final controversy on Friday that his campaign env@@ elop@@ ed his campaign by sending President Obama and Hillary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions about the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fellow soldier who endeav@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the actual position to declare statements that he could not have meant .
after he made the suggestion at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to imp@@ ose President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just s@@ ark@@ able .
the Twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help to we@@ aken the statement , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm came down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to make the focus of his campaign due to fail@@ over demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the Michigan Economic situation in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented Sar@@ kas@@ mus on his defence .
in late July he went on strong criticism when he said that the Russians should leave Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails , but he said later &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language boundaries in politics and then back to rowing .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test such as certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary &quot; clear@@ er , &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ologist , who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of sharp@@ ening the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump accepted a corro@@ sive sound , since its demand values decreased further .
a new pol@@ l of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a guided lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally not trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ uses his critics often to in@@ duce or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he struggles to focus the attention of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal fellow soldier in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may have his testimony .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent princip@@ als , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN @-@ interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ors , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are attemp@@ ting to argue that the government served under Obama , Clinton who served as Foreign Minister , ISIS allowed ISIS to spread out ISIS acting to control the situation in the Middle East .
in front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump served his attacks on the media and rejected them , on each of his words , and to be pres@@ et against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expert experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ laim@@ er than just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidency .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that no Wi @-@ Fi was allowed to make good coffee for 15 years .
of course , it was pushed by the prizes from his Bed@@ ford Avenue in Lad@@ en@@ front .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals betra@@ yed it as the last loss in a st@@ ating city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still don &apos;t believe that C@@ itation is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long time employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money to a new out@@ source , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept much .
Ver@@ b used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment also .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and cheese are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural dishes .
the café is not a beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodriguez said he noticed a st@@ ating current of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the Kaffe@@ et@@ r@@ ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b which I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea 24 day instead of their usual iced tea pot which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and devoted client since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he walked in front of the work and always ordered innocent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss fo@@ b watch and they prepare my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Foto Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .

Rodriguez said he had no den@@ ll that the soap store has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has to prepare a special soap for ver@@ b with cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee .
&quot; I think we &apos;ll go to their offer , &quot; Rodriguez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer transl@@ ates the menu into the Polish Republic and I said that he pre@@ ten@@ ds to put them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance to expand the café on a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , saying that he was destroyed on the ground when the café finished .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of Lok@@ als and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .

the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took up his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
President Roosevelt has served a Fai@@ ble for refined dol@@ phins at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Aqu@@ tur@@ tles .
his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was from the Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells about life in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a home house at the Lower East Side of the Food Per@@ spective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent Me@@ al &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , snow@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District which has already been in the business since the IP@@ crash 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese pie with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
when the rep@@ orters ordered min@@ ced , this took the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some budget , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine how many peanuts do eat that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E cre@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have put in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male fel@@ ines and it was served fresh baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the way to which the country went over to be no longer the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans was a central , divided subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget practices was as much as the new budget : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and water @-@ ollen were to be used as a wonderful kind , eating remains as &quot; wonderful kind , eating habits , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients among a cre@@ epy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat that was the focal point of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had been kept in front of taste or even healthy kitchen decorations .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bricks have prepared a court from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular ad@@ joining on lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continued out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t suit each other .
it was typical for many of the household staff .
as never before or since , budget staff - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by offering recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge , amp@@ en like creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals to become righteous .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a fes@@ tivity of historic treats .
especially tasty are the reviews of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ it out like the million million@@ th man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly g@@ ilded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was wonderful real@@ ms .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistakes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , the hired servants of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors of Roosevelt said that the White House produced the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most delicious food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , to deal with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country got back on the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , and said bricks , as well as science on food was applied .
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of brick @-@ law @-@ law better understood - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not make people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ shield .
after the plates were cleared out at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and cover a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roosevelt &apos;s lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes to be missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no designed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ lu@@ ded a spoon into the t@@ amed , brown pic@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
CO@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ bud@@ get@@ ing he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
bombs were killed in bombs against bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar settled his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a complaint @-@ bomb attack against the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which had so far saved the lives of almost 60,000 people , according to the image newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life to the game to pull people out of the bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a s@@ wine from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians in the bright symbol of the war in the horror of war .
however , as heroes he has never seen himself , he said : &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in order to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicopter have thrown four mou@@ ths over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer to trouble .
&quot; we er@@ adic@@ ate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that not children play it , &quot; c@@ ites the image his last words before he died .
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come to the surface usually only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks receive only 150 years ago .
the Greenland flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic along the bottom , in an hour , the average is just 1.@@ 220 metres away .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a patent remedy for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at least of a Greenland which was 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ advent@@ urer from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lifetime of li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist probably presum@@ ed that Grön@@ ag@@ ha@@ ie stein become Stone old .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter .
the researchers of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle know researchers accordingly little .
their time pent@@ at@@ mark is similar , as it took six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard , with a broad@@ caster .
prey this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the p@@ ines of a young polar bears .
possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ illi@@ ers on the bottom of the ice cream and search car@@ c@@ asses , which are from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland recipes , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch of the North Atlantic Ocean .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , while the biggest 502 cm measured .
to determine the age of animals , they are analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the linear@@ ity of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens is already created prior to the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high Carbon @-@ 14 in Lin@@ ear core .
therefore , her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear tests checks larger quantities of this radioactive carbon activity in the atmosphere .
in that with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , the lenti@@ l nucle@@ us contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday at his investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks in their lin@@ ens had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland was an old age of 335 years , whereas the record @-@ shar@@ k could be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers at the length could be assigned an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ her@@ es live primarily in icy waters , is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland @-@ w@@ al , put up a 120 year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip in which bacon was caught on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on spar@@ fl@@ es .
they mature then later - and al@@ lows down slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , which covers the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is thus dangerous and should concentrate on providing as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ rous lein .
a very big animal should however invest his resources more in a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City of Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Comp@@ et@@ ence field and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions may continue to operate from the financial transactions in the EU .
so far , for the so @-@ called EU Pass , the approval in the UK has so far been sufficient .
you are currently using great US banks .
several banks have already announced to re@@ locate jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; Frankfurt am Finance &quot; expects about 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , speaking at the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , unite the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the euro zone &apos;s largest banks , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of risk ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have continued its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to bank@@ note bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a large fund branch , cutting but also worse as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am considerably easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
additionally , the city with easily available wareh@@ ouses .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the Seine , the rental properties for first @-@ class wareh@@ ouses are also 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt had a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consulting Mer@@ cer , the city was seventh on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial position for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he succe@@ eds the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
for this , the power relations : in London , according to figures by the Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead will receive legal action from hepatitis C Patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counterpart decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the refund of legal costs which were created from the h@@ ep@@ ati@@ cal C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the inf@@ rin@@ gement of two patents from Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judges accepted a pattern of mis@@ conduct on mal@@ ice , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts .
in survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday U.S. counterpart : Bethel , Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to rise the cost , which arose during the defense of the fish .
Mer@@ ck is trying to cope with Gilead , domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck &apos;s mut@@ ually def@@ endants and property committed to laboratory work , such as Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband , an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ t USD 1 million donated for ben@@ evol@@ ent purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ ars ; former Foreign Minister gave a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax declar@@ ations of the past ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in regard to financial transparency , &quot; commissioned by Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and withdraw@@ als in relation to its previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control tax inspec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Cohen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ ers said to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already been able to have any questions related to assets , his donations for beneficial organizations , his business and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ threw himself on the topic and released a video on the Internet in which high ranking rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump stri@@ pped his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the topic also during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump had not paid a number of taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers who could still be the case .
federal states are become subject to a subject .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million as a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election event for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ef@@ ag@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
buff@@ ett said he had under@@ gone a tax examination of the IRS and have been &quot; afraid &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign has been published tax return by 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , who is now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , they paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ t of 2015 showed that this will only be USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans .
their main schol@@ ar was an economical index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were sold .

Jewish director sm@@ ite the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ mon@@ ing . - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots has unle@@ ashed a media watch after he revealed that the Kemp@@ insky Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre@@ fix , since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; sent his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann Israel sought the list of the hotels in the country .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel eliminated and was eliminated ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel over its own call center .
based on an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; embra@@ ced him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &apos;s management . &quot;
the reason , who stood behind , dis@@ band@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled about this event .
this is really very painful .
the fact that in Germany this hotel chain has been added to exactly this hotel chain , even larger dis@@ grace .
this does not need any explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers .
the incident showed a quite large reson@@ ance on the Internet in which people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the con@@ genital d@@ ai@@ ding of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ aming you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was in another post which was noted that the hotel that is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; failure &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; to record Israel into the quick@@ est list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted an spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds , that the country code has been added now .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber Com@@ rade against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students were strug@@ gling on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police , when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Rub@@ ber Com@@ rade against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers attempted to drive the students , which led to the police g@@ mig@@ ra@@ ged and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals of the Governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits on the provisional president of Michel T@@ emer to the walls .
the recent protests were some days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff , who had been revealed by a vote of the Senate on their account .

with the lifting of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran , increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , distributed by the ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , the further trade of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the action set between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes back to Russia this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign representatives accounted for about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily rice ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the Tourist levels in Russia .
one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken off last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something , from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received monuments of the old per@@ si@@ can civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner moves home when Bri@@ t won gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s latest last night in the car team spr@@ int in Rio to fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young man made his legend , when he stor@@ med home to break a victory of his favorite New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick , after taking place in March during the tour World Championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained when they saw potential in the gravel , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner , in the Quali@@ fication Round one of the Olympic Games , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ chs winning the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
leaving behind his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a major part of the transformation into a higher speed , in order to slow down it and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked like a BBC expert from his position and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have put a Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave evidence that he was inten@@ tionally down on the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a victory there was no such problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined together in the last three months as a team .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which gained seven out of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if that &apos;s a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect very successful five days at the bicycle stream .
with the form of knowledge it is possible in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that is the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety .
he had fought in front of the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the respective Women &apos;s Competition , which will continue tomorrow and completed , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura imp@@ lied , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team reli@@ es on its strong platform team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a ch@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations of the Rio were driven down .
it played Dra@@ mas in the background , as the resignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April surrounded by sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ les as well as retired from sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when one sees itself the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks after the legendary call G@@ BS , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , again .
future of the melting of Portland because of raising the energy contract .
the future of the aluminum det@@ ectors from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from the workers - stand at stake , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus raise all delivery contracts , as the supply of the energy company is necessary .
this step was followed by the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y is scheduled for 20 years in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland stand at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ places -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered by a closure .
in addition , it could occur to dom@@ ino effects as the melting furnace consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa decided to melt the Point Henry melt what led to an end of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked an closure .
this step follows the lon@@ ge@@ vity spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which delivers the big aluminum det@@ ectors with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin @-@ Valley , divided that three other owners will be announced their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant continues to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to conclude that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were to enter into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contracts entered a 12 @-@ month period of termination , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenues of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that it has already written the value of contracts already in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expec@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the agreements , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Arti@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to maintain the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have had come into force in 2010 , even if there is an explanation , why it came from the treaty .
analysts war@@ n because of the poor economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week , head of operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will use approximately 600 meg@@ awatts and some 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both systems disappear from the market , it would mean substantial reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and it would not be good for us as a power producer , &quot; he said .
more than just a caravan to reality TV Star , B@@ ander@@ a is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ da @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
B@@ ander@@ a , brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and on fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of fol@@ ks , which I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to the weeping , &quot; wrote B@@ ander@@ a .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an On@@ k@@ els and the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ re@@ mn@@ ant ) as they forgot the cover of her sister and ends with a classic che@@ er : you have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ ar@@ rests virtually any birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ tly brought the sentence , &quot; You suspected that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with respect to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the caravan has begun .
Kend@@ ra &apos;s big sister Kim enjoys her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , defeated ( it and her husband Kan@@ ye West were shown on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue , most of the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles more images than a fashion magazine , the output passes a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista by the 8@@ 32 pages of the ball 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his cover stars will be eag@@ erly a@@ waited , that in the last two years , pictures of the journal still le@@ ased out of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 , Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; passage model &quot; of their generation - among the earlier category is , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or you@@ ths of today that know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if anything goes to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women looking at the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had launched with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ inger likes success not everyone .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always a little ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June critici@@ zed Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , and she called them &quot; the mist@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ats up again , when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but riding on the mis@@ ery seems to pass by the point .
Antonio Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling you pictures of their respective pay@@ pal apps .
she sells her handmade pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their free time it is visible in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community Centers shall show 16@@ 0.000 people every year .
more than 16@@ 0.000 the most common areas of the country are rejected by the municipal government centres annually , while the industry reli@@ es on the implic@@ ations of other aver@@ cuts already on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland for already three of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair Del@@ og@@ ations and the same as they are entitled to free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services of the community , which have already been fast@@ ed , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , this legal centres will lose a further 30 percent of its federal funds .
the director of the municipal centre of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be even worse without the decision of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queensland Municip@@ ality centres are chron@@ ically under@@ min@@ ed , which means thousands of people from important services you need , rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems legal form and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
by June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of aid people from Queensland will be forced to return with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General Prosecutor and Bundes@@ jus@@ tiz@@ ers as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle cuts immediately , so that people may need help in legal problems .
last year , the state government filled its commitment to lift funds for right to national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of municipal bodies and its customers &apos; needs and to view that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

this resulted in representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue straight ahead in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would have the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U who could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the AF@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s country .
the Gre@@ ens left the Gre@@ ens despite a slight decrease of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) once again in the rural areas .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent each other .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties the SPD in the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 22.@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
it was still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously : 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
AF@@ D would be present with 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could return to a return , the pirates would not want to miss out in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia communic@@ ator came into the market .
the success@@ ors dominated the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ p@@ ous .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , which would be high resolution today for approximately two sel@@ fies of high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can buy fans still in the internet , but they somehow come from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet age .
however , 20 years ago , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a couple of months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West Coast format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax , communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even access to websites was possible via HTML brow@@ sers , if too slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded as a laptop .
then they found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
very proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could h@@ ort in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile pf@@ one of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and packaged in Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates providers , which came out all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone accounts for 5@@ 55 million units .
the global turnover of the devices is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications corporations enter .
in the meantime , around the smartphone has been created a whole industry .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World to launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , easy to operate on touch screen .
the victory of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
they disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these days are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understand@@ able for 20 years after its invention .
today , every German now looks at 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone even times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , in charge of the Siemens board of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

England must drive the Olympic spirit and expand its Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only offered in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me this was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , as at the time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and these will come again by creating new possibilities for local resident companies and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already present 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they predi@@ ct us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of Heath@@ row is too large .
I told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the branches were wrong in 2012 , and they will also lie wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heath@@ row answered every answer to him .
like the Olympic Games Heath@@ row is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to weather growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in all the UK .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency re@@ inde@@ cent cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heath@@ row is also one .
it is time that we drive to this Olympic spirit and expand the Heath@@ row and create our future business and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ ol@@ eum &quot; regarding ad block
for companies that earn money with online advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to get ad blocking , a &quot; cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game &quot; alike .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there were ad cur@@ ators on his desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog@@ post in which it means that users could upgrade their filters in the program to block advertis@@ ements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding on his advertis@@ ements to make it easier to detect the advertis@@ ements on what part of the site advertising is to be harder to be harder to detect .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a B@@ log@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle between the appealing open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been under way since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest companies in social media has dropped in the struggle is a strong indi@@ z for that become a wor@@ rying indication of advertis@@ ers for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe . nearly four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day of active users to access Facebook through their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ advertising is 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company insi@@ sts on ad block@@ ier on desktop PCs , since mobile advertis@@ ers don &apos;t have any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker with .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenues so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday announ@@ cing Facebook with that it would be &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences &quot; to upgrade to people more control over them .
on Thursday that Facebook shows that the new filter would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a message from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , why we have focused on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was right in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to record one woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman put himself in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; at the street and were taken by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ adt .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , who , of several vehicles , including a truck car , was to kill themselves .
it still died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
a investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter gave the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the public prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to the responsibility .
in any of the two cases - where one person ran on the highway - was decided that the mot@@ orists not need to go out that a pede@@ stri@@ ans in the middle of the night is running on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the driving murder was acquitted when she had killed a man and killed him , who was in August 2014 a night on the A1 near of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice was drinking and became un@@ conscious in the streets , and took the judgment .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman had answered on a justified way -- a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; totally unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was un@@ inhab@@ itable
the Venus was most likely inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus , based on tools and algorithms that res@@ emble climate research .
the model has been designed to determine if the Venus could have been re@@ marked with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggest@@ ing that the slow shift in Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have a thin , born @-@ like atmosphere , and slowly revol@@ ved around .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet had probably more dry places than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected before qu@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ on@@ ates their daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io declared in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like an umbrella , to the surface of a large amount of solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees of cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution , the previously suspected of planetary research .
even though it was probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans are ev@@ apor@@ ated and its steam @-@ steam was burnt down from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen@@ us , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide stayed back to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a coach and vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a lower part of the team &apos;s decision making .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association was immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as leader and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; said the 50 year @-@ old Roy in a position .
in the course of summer long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth to give it more depth and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a contribut@@ or right to decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the winner of the Jack Adam Awards for his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in any of the last years the last season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take back discussions again , put on strike
the workers &quot; struggles concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers will be exposed , while all the parties have put on a new discussion round at the table , &quot; said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil @-@ service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ust trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions said their last strike that the first in more than 25 years is to be a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group recorded the rates of its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 @-@ percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts out the company needed the required room to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to exp@@ ose its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alized with the UK energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices under pressure , an economic situation , which by the British decided in June to strengthen the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest labor disp@@ utes , which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion to spending new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star Wars of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler &apos;s space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star@@ ring .
the new data help to understand the Astronom@@ ers , why stars in the aster@@ isk are rotating at different rates as well as in which context the rotation of the planetary structures will be available .
&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ ters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star sc@@ ams of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they now turn to the fastest one .
at peak times , these stra@@ pping stars encounter large quantities of star@@ ches .
since this win@@ ch travels through the power fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is filtered , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of a visible star blo@@ b -- like sunshine .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors are ten@@ ding to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors are ten@@ ding to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ ring of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological cosmic laboratory to compare primary qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the star@@ ring of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is a lot more to us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ed down their blades and hang down their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerg@@ es
tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base @-@ Base .
after its emotional recovery period , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will carry on 12 August against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to the &apos; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player to the league , in 2009 he won the World Series for Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature is under a ten @-@ year contract since 2007 , 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contra@@ ction on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as advisor and youth coach - in full content .
as a player , it paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics @-@ like values .
however , the 41 year old is likely to be taken up in the rest of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodriguez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was , the occurr@@ ence is controversial outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; gave birth to ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect , for years , over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida has been preserved .
after a law@@ suit the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without any break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodriguez then was cute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ day did not fail .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski
caught up : because of a positive d@@ oping sample , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games have been o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping waterfalls .
an experienced athl@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
the first official d@@ oping around the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro have become known before the seventh competitions .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian target inski became positively tested in Brazil - immediately before the onset of Athle@@ tics Con@@ tests , these messages come to the accident .
last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been detected last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping instances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only around 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the qualification over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en submitted an opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the National Association take the affair &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also at night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics .
according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance to act the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ant EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended for pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B test should be already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow reported immediately to critic@@ ise the athl@@ ete &apos;s criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athl@@ ete draw the right fol@@ ks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such weight lif@@ ter may not be part of the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positively to his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both cont@@ ests the consumption , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had under@@ lined the entire Russian team up to one exception because of systematic d@@ oping , the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .

Sun also stood at the heart of a discussion with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping che@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers their sol@@ acker
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail accounts are currently targeted targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once , partly multiple victims of a attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already achieved a Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims were willing to re@@ lie@@ ve the sol@@ itary sol@@ ves to be able to take advantage of the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail @-@ software according to observations from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful , the potentially high conversion cost is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; we currently monitor a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
the perpet@@ rators brought the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the shift to company attacks were sc@@ ary quickly in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , you are looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ Press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to obtain the final turn@@ key code , the victims need money - usually in the form of c@@ yp@@ assing Bit@@ coin - transfer .
but where with private users use the personal photo database on the game , it goes with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fails when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German firms reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to cut the business activity completely , in case of a case humans were in danger of life .
in Germany , many of the victims were victims of attacks which could be threatened by the loss of nursing homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pays not , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
it is difficult for managers to reject the requirement of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure &apos;s security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
they explain their victims per chat , such as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free access sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and they will be rede@@ emed privately for payments of a few hundred euros , businesses have to pay partly hard and five digit sum@@ s to rep@@ ay their data .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky winn@@ ings from the Ran@@ som@@ ware sky@@ line the h@@ ack@@ ers always become professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write about a ran@@ som@@ ware in a week . &quot;
more likely , however , that it is three or four .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building cast@@ ers to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope of supply is a adap@@ tive tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding may be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the fresh purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a criminal and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per ann@@ ulated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the criminals take a spread with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 per cent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust the Ran@@ som@@ ware using a file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful adv@@ anc@@ ement , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators brought in future completely new goals in the internet of the things of the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they were able to get a thermo@@ stat connected to their control .
in the middle of winter , the un@@ lock of such a block could certainly be worth a rans@@ om .
if the off@@ ender then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in the Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day du@@ sting
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
it sounds rather over@@ loading but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear space , it works in no place close .
the materials of the interior are well processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling slightly .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 liters , and 10@@ 26 l are provided with the back @-@ up back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical , than it sounds like : seat surfaces of the return bank can be folded as a k@@ arm@@ chair and thus provide storage space from floor up to ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the trunk is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas very powerful .
he is likely to do something more qui@@ eter , however .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but steering may be more direct .
in the tested top version , &quot; Executive &quot; has no requests open .
the City @-@ Not@@ braking system ( works by pace 32 ) belongs to the coll@@ ision alarm system and the sp@@ uri@@ ous assistant .

the full connectivity is available but only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack lie below the arm@@ rest and are therefore something to achieve .
the top 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 exhaust standards .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ability of a car .
Air@@ line is not responsible : down@@ fall on the passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
for one liability may only be conc@@ ei@@ vable only in dangers which are typical for air traffic , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ ec@@ ake at the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer

this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case a family was severely affected by diar@@ rhoea and vomiting in the second day of their Turkish lau@@ ght .
she spent almost every holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective cl@@ ash which supposedly contam@@ inated the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey would have been very poor - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the bra@@ ids was in fact defective .
but the organizers experienced only briefly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , that the sea water was fine .
so he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the judgment .
all contam@@ in@@ ants have been found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through bro@@ och - belong to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .

better traffic flow on the motorway toll
it st@@ ole regularly on the circum@@ stance street - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal loss should be extended .
this is a good news for all the car , who stand in the working area at the ambient street every night in the st@@ au when they drive over the motorway mar@@ ker ( A 43 ) .
the road construction works on upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the departure Wes@@ eler Street to the right @-@ right lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread right from the Hammer road right .
the great advantage : traffic is divided up early and thus , with the total interest on the navig@@ able section of the state road 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the district Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ side runs on the Zu@@ br@@ inger on the mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 .
on week@@ days the back@@ drop is far from the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
the Nec@@ kl@@ ö@@ hr on the B 51 is shortly before departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is only one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in front of the three @-@ four@@ ths years .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the resulting St@@ au is due , the responsible state can not be said .
however , we have to calculate with years : because the bridge has an official remainder of up to 20@@ 34 .
for extending the legal bi@@ vou@@ chers , the state run consciously selected the traffic weak@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be tra@@ pped in the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
inter@@ cultural trip : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; Das Un@@ seen House . &quot;
the Club Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a musical project now .

the &quot; Class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Young Theater in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , who set up cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee backgrounds , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome categories as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young@@ sters of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and we@@ ave little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the course of course , as the press release of the Young Theater in Münster .

rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather repairs
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to the In@@ voice - but there are still hope .
the night may have been suitable for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chair@@ woman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars appeared around Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest star@@ ters with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they were apparently coming from the constellation Per@@ seus , which proceeds in the Nor@@ theast .
relaxing night : tips to sleep disorders
in the evening , one continues to walk around , at night you can wake up hours , in the morning it &apos;s not going to think out of sleep anymore .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one has such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults has sleep disorders , and more than ten per cent of adults can find their sleep frequent or permanently .
how extreme sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there may be different causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ak , member of the German Society of Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ List and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nie , an entry and a sleep disorder .
many people just go through to sleep as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says , member of the German home@@ work association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
this allows organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors behind it , but also drugs .
not rarely is the sleeping disorder of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in a depression often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors need each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be aw@@ ful , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and starts to salute you about everyday problems and -@@ wor@@ ding , gives you an example .
that leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
who should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week , and is imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor , advis@@ ing We@@ ak .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look very different : you &apos;re beaten , tired , irregular , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach and headache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , amongst other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
however , in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , at bed@@ problems we should at first contact the doctor , advis@@ ing knows .
he can clari@@ fy with research if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining during sleep @-@ laboratory medicine , for example , snor@@ ing with respiratory tract , with path@@ ogens , at bed@@ time or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder , explains Fi@@ xed .
we do not need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fi@@ xed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after turning away , one goes to bed his normal time .
beside the electro@@ des at the body , one carries a nose g@@ og@@ gles , chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
in addition , a camera features a camera on the ceiling .
how can you get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of screws in which one can attach to a better sleep .
We@@ ak counts on : regular sleep and rise times , not to sleep long in bed , not sleep in bed , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and watch at night not at the clock - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is absolutely not promoting .
what the jungle camp has missing medals in swimming
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed by Facebook as a dis@@ appo@@ inting cut of the DS@@ V team at Olympic is .
in December 2014 he brought gold for the first time in Doha , and set up his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has prot@@ ested his ex @-@ team @-@ mates by Facebook in front of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country in which a Olympic champion will earn 20,000 € bonus and a jungle heads € 150,000 should not be surprised by lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the d@@ oping control is very good .
so we can not compete with countries that support a lot and even operate under d@@ oping not so accurately or even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the inspec@@ tions should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have been reported for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who can &apos;t take a certain time before the F@@ WC / OS of independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hamburger Hamburger who now runs an ice@@ di@@ ele . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of baggage arrested
professional distances at the Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday the arrest of Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several tro@@ users and baggage steel as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants identified a gang in the area of Düsseldorf , a gang which was known from the police from last theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ te since mid @-@ July of this year and were very common , working and particularly professional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ oxi@@ fication 34 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which have traveled for the purpose of crimes committed by off@@ ences to Germany , can demonstrate four actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had caught a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ aus , a few lenti@@ l trees , in between still another remaining head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in works at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the road from east to west , one passes to playing fields , a soft nursery garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house somebody has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite the Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created .
article about this &quot; trendy Born district &quot; as the property development company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in the last weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents drew rental contracts , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , since the beginning of the year , the police had won several times a tough action against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
having been cleared out on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers had been cleared , pat@@ rou@@ ded the police three weeks earlier , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers , commissioned by the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the ev@@ ac@@ uation had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the pav@@ ement before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain early late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects a primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens are located .
lef@@ tist violence is not the principal population of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which attracts three children , especially from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hood , they share the concern to the rising and un@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who wanted to ask a majority of polic@@ eman from v@@ and@@ ing left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch who make the Berlin &apos;s inner en@@ ator and police officers , make up their neighbours so evi@@ dently not .
Friedrichsha@@ in at the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which was even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high level of poverty .
houses and the native living projects belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former German Democratic Republic , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer road in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ am had been cleared under a proper road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and partly still inhabited by people that they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them now residents from East times and former home networks have become their &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
this also noticeable in the car that has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them in the designed disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were over@@ thrown with paint bags .
no other street has been mentioned so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neighbours can see this as a problem , might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body viol@@ ates , according to statistics , is almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the greatest part of the crimes do not make any damage , the ten@@ sion@@ ed rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next 17 years , has no talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , they are anxi@@ ous : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been .
the famous burning cars also exist directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the studied architecture , its street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously moved into the thorou@@ gh@@ er street - and stayed .
therefore , it was so important that the people get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claim the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents of new@@ bor@@ ns the road will continue to be taken away : in former building blocks , the old residents imp@@ ose it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - here are more people who are not so good enough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can not look well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if a man does not listen to anybody ?
it focuses on all sides of fru@@ stration , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , has little understanding with little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; .
those who get started should be aware of - just like someone who attracts in a pub , po@@ or@@ ly complain about noise .
all persons presented with pre @-@ first names have therefore requested to be called not named in their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ t is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ t is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
furthermore she is a social worker locally .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , workers , refugees , administration , authorities , and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than grat@@ efully that Deu@@ t now is there , the ei@@ ving wool mil@@ let , which has especially a problem .
so , some - less spot@@ ting than rather on the multitude of desired responsibilities - meant , as the administration wanted to write the job .
we have been looking for an administrative force with a talent of languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a mysterious wool .
however , administrative work is not their central zone , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ t writes .
most of all , it go to organisation , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place scheduled for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ t Ehr@@ - and chief staff supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and comprehen@@ sion problems .
soon there are new containers in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time , flats for connecting fle@@ ets , which have been recognised .
for the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment .
the costs for the building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ ors to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it &apos;s not functioning until now , whether it is based on private apartments , Deu@@ t .
therefore , Common apartments have to be prof@@ icient , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new container will be erected in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a solid stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and ex@@ hil@@ ation activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ keeper , do not work non @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that working for the community is a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activities , however , does not work only .
the day needs a strong structure , say Deu@@ t and Customer .
people would have to develop a bre@@ ach feeling .
so it need offers as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so there are administration and volunteer here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the method &apos;s long duration is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it should just take it , and they can easily re@@ bridges it , for example with language courses .
who eventually developing the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach don &apos;t work , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate itself .
the significant majority is motivated .
problem cases , however , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , with whom there is nothing . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two fear of radic@@ alization fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ den@@ um could and would not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensitive .
these events are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ in kill them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteer spot have to look on site and in the region after activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer , the politics are afraid .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we would like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been fast@@ ed to integrate the previous people more reasonable .
these are currently around 100 persons , mostly young men .
however , when people are in need to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
