<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer sought a little variation with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a couple of minutes the horses reminded of their holiday, they hunt in quick gallop home to feeding home.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday the best golfers of all times - 101 tournament victories - back to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left himself with his family about the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he swang on photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthaler handed over to the man from Anhausen in a small gala to Golden Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of the likable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesamt Cross, silver bay leaf, Champions-tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen pushed him already.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winners of the pyramid piles is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award will give me a lot," says Langer, "because she will not only be awarded for sportive successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades Langer has been promoting offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure to invest and prevent trading agreement TTP, they want to use Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic request.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to be rather small in doubt and warns against that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to bestow the economy to death and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, he would be completely different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive regulatory approvals, and makes it strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to fulfill he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why the taxes were raised to the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the country, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants have even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical Teody-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, then party internal discussions could be returned.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal support in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris Climate Agreement plans to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton aims to expand and strengthen renewable energies with its investment program and demands: "a country will create clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - also with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the capacial trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the United States do not want to insulate from international trade - just better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton demands Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is necessary, he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the major discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, who wants to unload the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "any winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He gucks with great eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division's division of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for allotted women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unlong it was opened officially.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an watchman before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say," "" "Every woman who comes here has made her escape experience with sexual violence," "" "said Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee because they are politically persecuted because they are torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe as a hope for Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape: "many do not steal away because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honoring, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, tugboats are demanding a bottle of water for a bottle of water, is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that the end, as soon as they would appear in Germany, is told by Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, all women in refugee are often referred to as inferior amounts of less and abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the Munich-North, are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar with that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or you don't dare to talk openly about the living, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they are often not trying to help, more accommodations need for them, demands Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they were using a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction, some answers with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are not something in accommodation in the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Schwaben, women alone were not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressure preacher of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central-Franconia there are in some community shelters or their own homes only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women there.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "rights of women and gender equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "if the privacy or men and women gather together, it may be too - persistent - violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower rooms should be separated and accessible to women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women of this protection must be felt, you can read on the Andre, which gives it to the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of external sideways "?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot honour the intrucks that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a stroke, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putting smile worked lightly and hardly radiated heat, even for its restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "- according to a report every five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not just return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan had behaved so much as it would never happen something bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me, enthusiasm, to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's beaming, sustainable Kühle showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin was parted and accused Ankara to have Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even greater, since it was committed by a mooed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be difficult again when not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media introduced a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed like the Turks would bear the debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious test, the accusations of senior officials said that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in territories of Syria, which controls the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed that vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of Erdogan who wanted to listen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first of all friends who can get after he became a coup d "état in a failed coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal hionslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the national television budget predicted fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it in this way: "tourists there for long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is uplivid to the West because it was a response to the attempted coup as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the prolonged resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to withdraw from the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian State of State won a bonus for ensuring that he requested a coup d "état against the elected government of government.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is for Moscow, a self-understanding that himself has a deep-sitting fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glassy palace at the sea, it enabled Russia and Turkey, as it once described me an analyst, "Alliance of external sideans": two countries that violate themselves from the West and treated badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public propitiation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow gave himself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of hearing both President at the press conference said that they didn't even strive the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey avoided it intentionally to respond to a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open endencies - and in view of the potential for a complete Disaster, as NATO member of Turkey fired the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was the representative of Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972, the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin (in Russian), it was later logging and head of the head of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin," "" "Thank you for confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as head of State concerning the legislation and inspections on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov has asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage was mysteriously made in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time, one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was responsible for Soviet intelligence service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ludicts for the cameras, just a few of them are convinced - especially now before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once praised as a potential president, would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - came across to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted at the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said "It's true that I had asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to put confidence for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his representative.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people, which he trusted in the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once upon Putin, Ivanov had been estimated to be President of Russia after the second term of President of Russia, a third presidential term could be violated against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near Allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became the president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 slings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economist Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first who went across the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment at the building of the Queensercross country.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic size at this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the Decks gets in Rosyth a Betonguss for the Deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">At this fantastic project, the shutter stands for high-proof high-depth and deep-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the northern tip deck, we had to close the existing gap on the North or landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled off at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child don't go out to play anymore, but rather, preferring to spend their free time to spend on screens, has been complains in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go there is to get people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities outdoors are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am thinking of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app based on characters which were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later it was created a cartoon series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture was the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smart phones and look for Pokémons that were traced with a GPS and, once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the betwian and leaping for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the release of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increased performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring" "" "to take 30 minutes" "" "to be active" "" "to be active" "" "and" "" "to be active" "" "on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who are regularly driving sports, reduces his chances to become cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, that is fun to them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health is covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new girlfriendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyway, there are also shorten players who always have to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if you could follow smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal, and the use will be recreated with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, and many people on the hunt will help to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final testing in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present myself among the women's Olympic Games in the Turns and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turists, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Catholics, round, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This squad finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years, the number one was a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiad and cheered America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won with an individual multi-campaign for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're experiencing the top of this sport, but we don't see gym categories throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympiad will only have four turists in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a expensive sport and Turner first line in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who come up for training, setup, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in wealthy suburbs which can help business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner get their whole training and this is a devalous and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer von Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired the congregations of Aun countless, young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, making a more affordable and easy access gymnasium training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my Turnhalle Foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents (mainly black and hispanic) and trained by national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality antennas to learn the possibility of learning from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of that crew to bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic Team goland thank you that so many young girls are motivated with a different background to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a safer place for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to turn away with armed troops.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from front or from behind, this video will show you how you turn around the skewers.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you turn back from behind, then you should turn your attacker so that you can see your attackers and take from the gun line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you strike your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with the knee into the glue and rotate, while the attacker is squeezing pain together, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel and move backwards while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, take the weapon and rotate them, so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Transfer the weight simultaneously to the weapon and beat the attackers to the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backward and make the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller intercepted his immune system and worms of a serious test - taking some of the dirtiest and most dirtiest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and itator Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dismissed his course on a Euro-schooner, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse head of a drawback and public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving every object, he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what he is going on.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed in the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, rinsing the rinse head of a drawback, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely disgusting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on promoting Darmbals and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he stretched out, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intestines by travelling through the world, and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to washing dishes of toilets, the task introduced its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "already as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concern and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slumps."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample line showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared with this, the luminance speed will be freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after their Luminometer numbers over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have a less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel ilm" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria in different places like the bathroom. "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I've found in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll stumble here, because it is inside disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Battle, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating about watching and is simultaneously the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We made a crazy Brainstormings to the end that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide for more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added: "let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he had asked for some of the things I had directed to lecken, like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to join them, and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm happy that we have recorded some of these dirty treats to film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of those surveyed, lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent reported that they have at least sometimes used products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country's Day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until 2021, the Parliament election will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">The summer holidays, heat and land wrestling do not occur until now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be persuaded by the voters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers, who are on the country, are on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holiday, helpers are able to inflate the posters, inflating air balloons, flyers and pour out voices at the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has undergone an election campaign close to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, when you can tell at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, like heavily newcomer AFD, and what remains is left at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his grandposters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and chatted a little with the people, as it did already his legendary artist Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seeling has gotten cold feet, so chancellor Merkel gives blame to the blossoms of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We create this" "" "have accelerated the rise of populists, which is probably going to cost him a beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time on the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two chancellor Angela Merkel to large explorations, Merkel called the German Parliament in the Northeast Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was recently held in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But there is too no one to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the North-East CDU eliminates the usual election campaign in market areas and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, Kokert says, plays only one "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that you need the base the base, that it must be very strict, once again, to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left side of the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any thing in the territory of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU-Election Kokert to his fellow soldier is also self-larvingly: "they must go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: Doroeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game is, Sellering has called his SPD in a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, S & D Group was last updated with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election the SPD gained some 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, small party with seven percent in polls, could create the leap into the country's tag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are making a modern virtue, a modern virtue, and put them in the internet for their election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaigns," says the state-president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigns on track ensues give to local vocal folds among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a houseboat by the meckline lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."</seg>

<seg id="8">He will also be praised for the work of those who are responsible, even if it comes to the establishment of mastering rides.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site is emigrated on Monday to the south, and also the lock of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was eliminated and thus the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation inside the place has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now run from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic to the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was partially significant complaints," says the main office of the refurbishment "administrative project Florian King."</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of the brook-road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sought routes and rather than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that mancher truck was franked into residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limit has not been kept, the municipality strengthens the Messrust of Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was significant overpassing," says King that made himself a place over the situation.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-refurbishment in them has led to net sales, each one asks to look through.</seg>

<seg id="28">That is existential-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants I met "hard."</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released, politicians would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government President Jörg Schmidt on a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the inn will benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B. now they must also do the disadvantages, which result in the rehabilitation.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the recent proposals, the Interior Minister de Maizière is now a thick safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a job status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner tell all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner, "says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security box.</seg>

<seg id="8">Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I too took part in this too.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as the Minister of the Interior, he was on results and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière has a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, before he presented his conclusions to the safety in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some have been announced, announced, announced that a new security Authority should take care of encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives to passenger data and arms.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies are also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière will start a second call for proposals that have not been able to do so far with the SPD: he wants to avoid sympathies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "grants the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He will hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demanding nothing, which have no chance at the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some new ideas will present de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in itself: he plans fast method for deportations and more opportunities to shift people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted targeted towards the country, should declare their smart phones and reveal social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">At Dulces for the past asylum seekers, he wants to make some more worse than so far - such, the crimes are going to go away or refuse their papers to misuse their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legally.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even more unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - for example - in the imbalance of moil, for example - raises the question: what does that actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subject of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to speak in saying that the assassin of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, many people in view of high refugee troubles are concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that entertained people in deeply, could not let themselves be cluttered in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Just the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The security is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election fights.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the subject of inner safety, the Union and SPD are increasingly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past days there was high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garchy dispute over the Federal police's equipment, then on a security policy collection for some Unions of the Interior, who also demand a burial ban and a return from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is boasting here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double pass he doesn't stop anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have mastered the debate in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">Re-opened, it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a Burka ban it concerns constituent concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constitutionally unconstitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it must first show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot in the things to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD also tries to profiling an internal security subject.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination: who purchases sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle age plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you have to comment on the commentator to oversee him under the pseudonym non-pseudonym-aged insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the resurgence of records of sound panels is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the unity of physical objects, but attributed to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all precursors according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older platform buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of Yougov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television would follow me the camera, while I wear a modest gray suit, a modest gray suit, and a modest gray suit before I stand to hold my hands and make something more determinant like: "so, let us take a close look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart has soared in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were based, there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, by Sister Ray (data of data: two young women, three men aged middle age) into Reckless Records (data: eight men of middle age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These Schallplatten, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed home), dress the walls of his own room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy records, which he sold and again sold items that he sold, when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are of the late 60s, early '70s that was published when I was 11 or 12. things I probably had to do with them to buy her," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are rather introverted and we would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he hits the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and will take care of buying their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the talks which I have led, people usually have emptied their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records back, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to the Appendices of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to recognise that turntables are a soothing community of peers.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payments system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turntables feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound sites, of objects, happy jugenders.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to address spiritual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered a staff from an flat stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people purchased a record last month they haven't listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a turntables that they never use while 7% of those who buy a plate, do not have a turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I blotted through a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently came here and said," "" "I don't have a turntables, but I would like to buy a Radiohead's record, so I'd like to put them into the shelf." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musikline.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who come slowly in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I was cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are pairs around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women middle-aged people.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, wild Beasts of the latest synthesizers and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drates from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks quite lonely, but brand psychic traumas are badly detectable if one stands for someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around in the business for a few minutes and consider the variety of records for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more a mannequin bumpers than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so collecting plates are not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It will cost much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a fell sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I am to explain - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holder: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit the note that jeans Hotpants are to graven, I observe a group of young teenage girls, who group to group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to put them up.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also this is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of Yougov vote, they have at least in turnaround in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, turnaround and in Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not through the bumpers through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by records while starting the gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who stands over the shoulders of old men of middle-aged people.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live in the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a trial of the week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be to break down 72 temporary businesses, selling cigarettes to energy drinks, selling hairdresser and tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy, which would not be paid to taxes, and that a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the nationally supported union and other groups are not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also carried out that the temporary businesses and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people that give the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely feasible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a lot more important role, than people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday night at a broken stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji announced a masterclass in the handling, side-stepping, pressures, liner run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of silver medal - Britain fourth at that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they stroke New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals in the same day could fall back in the final day.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, it has struck a 15-man team in top shape using this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had a wonderful effect and left the attacks GBS from fun off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in, as if one would run in driving coaches. the World Series winner went 5-0 to top, when Osea Kolinisau went down in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another four minutes season, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he turned into.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly used the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle Drop from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal but it has only stopped thinking.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua lete a touch-down corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new album since repeating it and there was still about a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presides by further weak Tacclings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still being seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and completed the fixed gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant cliplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a trial for GB, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South African, whose fans sang, flaunts and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame bet the i-door clocks with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounds, the Fijis hugged and crushing out the GB of crushing out in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and the UK urged South Africa to a tight half-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late-time tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony in the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thereby the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard Hieve those who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the confession that were at the rod, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainer Robin Williams was ever present when she rusted the second Olympiad in the two without tax wife, the first women in the history of the British sport that put up such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unqualified use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete that reflects on the surface with the elegance of swarf, which does not reflect the type of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each Gold in Rudern there is a battalion to consent helpers that make the difference and there was no more comfortable than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could be treatment in early 2014, out of season, could begin, which held the break to a minimum, if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the Victory, their first thoughts about Williams, who spent a nervenous morning, thus spent a bit more than anything else and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a centurion in the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much to me, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, hence a massive Thank you. he's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to trainer or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take time for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">There must appear next week at a wedding on your own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="10">The drinking water supply of the Veitemeyer group with headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water and contains 32 locations and hamlet with around 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member states are the church Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), remembered that Rupert Göller was employed in 1985 as a waterbed and has already been appointed managing director of the Zweckers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work about office and maintenance activities, the budget planner, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency tours at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994) and compensation in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the new creation of a central computer control (2004) and the share of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill, and I have always added innovations again, because water may cover life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio she praised Göllers faithless, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart attacks for its water purpose and he has lived in the water-purpose, and it would be his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he must present the success concept of the Veitemeyer group to nitrate from the Water Forum of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he has received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller also praised Aquwart Alfons Griebel who worked together for 28 years with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water-keeper and he was a devoted scarce.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the well-structure and restructure of the association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The greatest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the fracture in the high container in Kirchlouder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night also had to work, so that the towns with water could be supplied.</seg>
<seg id="27">At once, the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained at once because one filled the high-tank of Pettstadt with battles.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of drinking water supplies were handed over to Daniel Stürmer, who kicks up the succession of Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week a filter made a filter, which gave them slotch, false teeth and evapsed cheeks, they called some critic a racist cartoon by Asians - "yellow."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy was referred to a larger problem, that the company has versatility.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and disgust have been widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared it would have been deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime-characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineers for the medium, decided to erase their Snapchat account, and asked others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="24">"either she has no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are working there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that is largely unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings, while the investigations are continued.</seg>

<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news conference was adopted on Thursday their own findings, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force's Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom established a superficially restricted process for the creation of Isil and Iraq's security services," was the highest-day Democrats Group, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, such as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of rectifying reports," abused morals under analysts and "gave excessively little space for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence on an intervention of the White House in the CentCom Analyst in respect of a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the General Constitutions of the Pentagon, which were recorded by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press review of the Pentagon, published in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Foreign Minister is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also noted that "experts sometimes have considerable opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the Ministry of Intelligence and the Defence Ministry welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense."</seg>

<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff itself, which will protect from the bracelet for swimmer to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot place the TV, read a newspaper reading or listen to your neighbours in the queue in Coffeshop, without Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of women with dimples, would have been very well received under these well-known names that would be sent to Prime Time, being built by sponsors and well-being-TV commercials, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, out of Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade there are sports species that are not generally accepted: airpistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make sure arguments for my particular lovers, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that there is a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines and until 2012 had an athlete that made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Trampolinjump has some outer side charms, partly because it sounds for an unenlightened ear, suitable for a clownsschule as which sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a refreshing enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never to end swollen clalls - but also the Grazie of the gym and divers, the two sports that combines them essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victorious jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and need a row of falling movements (rotating, hollow and otos) before they landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to official Olympics, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-standing athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in the Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue in their quest for gold, quicker, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go back and down, downwards and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but in the television broadcast also another cave goal: the world or the Olympic sensor.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted scattering is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up an audience.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I felt as a little tiresome of these games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the Trampolinspringers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her prallt, seemingly heavios like an astronaut, go to the top, then downwards, then easily upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves enter the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endrons of Women are held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, likewise at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC, the final installment will disappear as part of an afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that probably will probably oversee the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the loss of consciousness can only be achieved through the Anthropoids and the objectionfication of male athletes - as suggested by The Wall Street Journal, according to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects his home, new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an Affiliate of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, beat on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that very poor protesters were killed during clashes with the police in firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight forward to breaking?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid business alliance with an rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and expand into more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people fall on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Government's response was indebted according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen shot dead unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The main videos of protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety experts suggest young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are closely together with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby dissidents were turned into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian province.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, that cover everything from the soil usage to the worms in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a successful election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zunchy, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced on the last few years, could benefit from turbulence and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness should explode in the surface of Hinkuckelns under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopian states were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, which they are in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies, which hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian states that they were gathered together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia, among others.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since erones, the Amharas, which come from Ethopiens mainly in Christian upcountries, in politics and economy, while they have exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and living in flat lands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair, by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-public illness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly vered in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and use special envoy to edit opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians of new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to increase the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray Region of North America, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested by the government and were apparently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razcia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that period of turbulences went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionaries, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intention of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, led by Tigray and hatred toward the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenfly on the neighboring Somalia, even though they were recently announced that she had closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he does not want his associate in a volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama to be established "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the final controversy on Friday that his campaign enveloped his campaign by sending President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions about the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow soldier who endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection, in the actual position to declare statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he made the suggestion at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to impose President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was just sarkable.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement, that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm came down to Mr. Trump while he tried to make the focus of his campaign due to failover demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the Michigan Economic situation in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus on his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July he went on strong criticism when he said that the Russians should leave Mrs. Clint Emails, but he said later "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language boundaries in politics and then back to rowing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test such as certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary" clearer, "said Ruth Sherman, a communication sexologist, who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the sound for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted a corrosive sound, since its demand values decreased further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a guided lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally not trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he accuses his critics often to induce or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he struggles to focus the attention of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal fellow soldier in the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant may have his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent principals, gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN-interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbitors, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are attempting to argue that the government served under Obama, Clinton who served as Foreign Minister, ISIS allowed ISIS to spread out ISIS acting to control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump served his attacks on the media and rejected them, on each of his words, and to be preset against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually come to the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimming with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks receive only 150 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic along the bottom, in an hour, the average is just 1.220 metres away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal speeds up to 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-term lifestyle seems to be a patent remedy for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal "Science" at least of a Greenland which was 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Schadventurer from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifetime of lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologist probably presumed that Grönaghaie stein become Stone old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice-sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers of Greenland's lifestyle know researchers accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentatmark is similar, as it took six animals in front of Svalbard, with a broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the pines of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrouilliers on the bottom of the ice cream and search carcasses, which are from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland recipes, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch of the North Atlantic Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they are analysed with the carbon-14 method the linearity of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already created prior to the birth of the sharks, which are contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high Carbon-14 in Linear core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear tests checks larger quantities of this radioactive carbon activity in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In that with 220 centimeters long, the lentil nucleus contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday at his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland-sharks in their linens had normal carbon-14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland was an old age of 335 years, whereas the record-shark could be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers at the length could be assigned an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland's sharks are obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusheres live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland-wal, put up a 120 year-old harpoon tip in which bacon was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on sparfles.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and allows down slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, which covers the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is thus dangerous and should concentrate on providing as many descendants as early as possible," explains the Evolutionsbiologist Schrous lein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should however invest his resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner's latest last night in the car team sprint in Rio to fame as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role of his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy, who made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. the young man made his legend, when he stormed home to break a victory of his favorite New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after taking place in March during the tour World Championships in London despite the backdrop of Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they remained when they saw potential in the gravel, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner, in the Qualification Round one of the Olympic Games, but in the Standarchs winning the New Zealander in the first round.</seg>

<seg id="13">A strategy change made a major part of the transformation into a higher speed, in order to slow down it and it's Kenny and above all skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked like a BBC expert from his position and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have put a Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>

<seg id="27">If that's a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect very successful five days at the bicycle stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of knowledge it is possible in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would mean for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the same from Hoy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland because of raising the energy contract.</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum detectors from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from the workers - stand at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus raise all delivery contracts, as the supply of the energy company is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy is scheduled for 20 years in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland stand at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces -direct and indirect - could be endangered by a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could occur to domino effects as the melting furnace consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa decided to melt the Point Henry melt what led to an end of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked an closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the longevity speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which delivers the big aluminum detectors with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latin-Valley, divided that three other owners will be announced their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The complex is located in the majority of a joint venture by Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant continues to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to conclude that the" "" "securing transactions" "" "were to enter into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Contracts entered a 12-month period of termination, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the power supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenues of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL told that it has already written the value of contracts already in the amount of $187 million in "expectation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said the decision to book the agreements, the" "" "ability of Artias..." "" "to maintain the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that there have been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have had come into force in 2010, even if there is an explanation, why it came from the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn because of the poor economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysis of the analysts at the beginning of the week, head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will use approximately 600 megawatts and some 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, it would mean substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And it would not be good for us as a power producer, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the klischeearrests virtually any birthday party (Seactly brought the sentence, "You suspected that we had forgotten you?," with honesty of a cartoon by 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to participate in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="8">Kendra's big sister Kim enjoys her what the Vogue cover is concerned, defeated (it and her husband Kanye West were shown on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "passage model" of their generation - among the earlier category is, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons, or reality stars or youths of today that know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if anything goes to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women looking at the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had launched with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenninger likes success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV story, Jenners was always a little tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June criticized Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleagues in Gigi Hadid, and she called them "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>

<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for then a lot: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, even by fax, communicator was able to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, if too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded as a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then they found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>

<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could hort in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was right in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police calls witnesses to record one woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman put himself in the dark "in an act of despair" at the street and were taken by several cars, the police said in Waadt.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was most likely inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus, based on tools and algorithms that resemble climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine if the Venus could have been remarked with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggesting that the slow shift in Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have a thin, born-like atmosphere, and slowly revolved around.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet had probably more dry places than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected before quaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus exponates their daily side of the sun almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio declared in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like an umbrella, to the surface of a large amount of solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees of cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus, which resembles the evolution, the previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it was probably inhabitable, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and its steam-steam was burnt down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogenus, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide stayed back to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="16">But where with private users use the personal photo database on the game, it goes with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fails when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to cut the business activity completely, in case of a case humans were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, many of the victims were victims of attacks which could be threatened by the loss of nursing homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "pays not, you only support the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the requirement of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, such as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free access sites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be redeemed privately for payments of a few hundred euros, businesses have to pay partly hard and five digit sums to repay their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky winnings from the Ransomware skyline the hackers always become professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write about a ransomware in a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, that it is three or four.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building casters to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in the scope of supply is a adaptive tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding may be changed," "" "Wisniewski says." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then search for further hackers to spread the fresh purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set of a criminal and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per annulated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals take a spread with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust the Ransomware using a file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful advancement, the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators brought in future completely new goals in the internet of the things of the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they were able to get a thermostat connected to their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the unlock of such a block could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offender then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and all-day dusting</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It sounds rather overloading but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear space, it works in no place close.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and are comfortable, only the cockpit-top is falling slightly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR-V storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 liters, and 1026 l are provided with the back-up back, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical, than it sounds like: seat surfaces of the return bank can be folded as a karmchair and thus provide storage space from floor up to ceilings 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V thanks to torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to do something more quieter, however.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But steering may be more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the tested top version, "Executive" has no requests open.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City-Notbraking system (works by pace 32) belongs to the collision alarm system and the spurious assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision swarts sometimes irritated because he assessed many obstacles as "herannahing objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works of the televocative assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator is responding to the usage recognition and threatening the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available but only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI jack lie below the armrest and are therefore something to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The top 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with the Euro 6 exhaust standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday suitability of a car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one continues to walk around, at night you can wake up hours, in the morning it's not going to think out of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults has sleep disorders, and more than ten per cent of adults can find their sleep frequent or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How extreme sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be different causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weak, member of the German Society of SchlaffList and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the insomnie, an entry and a sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people just go through to sleep as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht says, member of the German homework association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This allows organic, mental or behavioral factors behind it, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping disorder of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in a depression often," "" "says White." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be awful, wakes up all two to three hours and starts to salute you about everyday problems and -wording, gives you an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">That leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week, and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advising Weak.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: you're beaten, tired, irregular, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach and headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, amongst other things, behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at bedproblems we should at first contact the doctor, advising knows.</seg>
<seg id="24">He can clarify with research if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining during sleep-laboratory medicine, for example, snoring with respiratory tract, with pathogens, at bedtime or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fixed.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only do not make a nap," "" "said Fixed." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After turning away, one goes to bed his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes at the body, one carries a nose goggles, chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera features a camera on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can you get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws in which one can attach to a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weak counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not to sleep long in bed, not sleep in bed, don't watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and watch at night not at the clock - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is absolutely not promoting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altaus, a few lentil trees, in between still another remaining head pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the road from east to west, one passes to playing fields, a soft nursery garden and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "on the facade of a grey house somebody has" "" "ugly!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite the Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy Born district" as the property development company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in the last weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents drew rental contracts, on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, since the beginning of the year, the police had won several times a tough action against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having been cleared out on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadtersmiths, with 300 police officers had been cleared, patrouded the police three weeks earlier, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers, commissioned by the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the pavement before the houses in the sun, others entertain early late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects a primary school and kindergartens are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the principal population of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana *, which attracts three children, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hood, they share the concern to the rising and unrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a "" "" Kiez "" "," who wanted to ask a majority of policeman from vanding left. "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench who make the Berlin's inner enator and police officers, make up their neighbours so evidently not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain at the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which was even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high level of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Houses and the native living projects belong to the "Kiez:" in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former German Democratic Republic, including nearly the entire Mainzer road in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstream had been cleared under a proper road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and partly still inhabited by people that they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become the magnets for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them now residents from East times and former home networks have become their "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the car that has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them in the designed disks or freshly painted facades that were overthrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street has been mentioned so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbours can see this as a problem, might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body violates, according to statistics, is almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The greatest part of the crimes do not make any damage, the tensioned rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next 17 years, has no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, they are anxious: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deut is a new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deut is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore she is a social worker locally.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, workers, refugees, administration, authorities, and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than gratefully that Deut now is there, the eiving wool millet, which has especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spotting than rather on the multitude of desired responsibilities - meant, as the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have been looking for an administrative force with a talent of languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a mysterious wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not their central zone, Annika Deut writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all, it go to organisation, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place scheduled for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was highest time," "" "says Regine Customer that Annika Deut Ehr- and chief staff supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and comprehension problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time, flats for connecting fleets, which have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Councillors to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's not functioning until now, whether it is based on private apartments, Deut.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, Common apartments have to be proficient, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new container will be erected in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid stay, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and exhilation activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housekeeper, do not work non-profit work - and that motivated and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community is a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activities, however, does not work only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a strong structure, say Deut and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a breach feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it need offers as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there are administration and volunteer here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The method's long duration is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it should just take it, and they can easily rebridges it, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually developing the feeling he could not help in Urbach don't work, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, says customer honestly, "people, with whom there is nothing." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two fear of radicalization fear of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what mancher naive like." "" "a residenum could and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These events are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassin kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteer spot have to look on site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, the politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we would like," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been fasted to integrate the previous people more reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, when people are in need to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
