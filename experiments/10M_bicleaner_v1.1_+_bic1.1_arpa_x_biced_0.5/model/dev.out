Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of an international agreement as well as Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
this is also said to be a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and will bring Netanyahu to the peace process .
through the deal of Obama , in the Iran nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed .
in March Netanyahu immediately testified at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the United States Congress held a controversial speech against Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to that of the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his friend killed
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police to have shot his girlfriend and that he would have to come to his house with officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , officials took the cor@@ pse of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note , which I wanted to reverse it , I loved Amy and it &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood after indications of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb that had travelled to the school grounds in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who had already been 300 miles to the school grounds where he was killed and killed by the police on the police officer , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all of the eigh@@ ty people have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb had made the fat@@ eful emergency call at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb opened his life , when police fired it into him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers &quot; forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to make a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators of the two ends of the state have published detail , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned , in a book written by his book , in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life .
both sub@@ stituted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ators are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the lamb , praised , said he appeared to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a study of health reasons and said that he had any problem for any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy of the University said that the promotion , for the lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic step towards being Assistant as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer the Lamb .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane after he drove again in Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a building about a mile South of his parents &quot; outskirts on Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car ran still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , the University began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of around 12,000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together by mutual friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
he was then the Queen of Women .
all the girls were melting when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s were , obviously , some time .
in the emergency call , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there wasn &apos;t a certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the baking stone house , that belonged to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they had remained friends and had a daughter who had now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met lamb , but Abig@@ ail did not meet with his daughter Abig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues .
he met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , when he and Abig@@ ail took them three years ago in a summer @-@ fair .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter wrote and sings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes fun coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light @-@ lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he dre@@ amt and P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s Night at night 5 September , after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play completed ahead of a rare audience .
there was no signs that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the clean and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had good sense for j@@ esting .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
around 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a candle light ceremony on Tuesday night .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial Guard , while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
classes will be taken back on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to returning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police told it now that he had shot an emergency call after he had shot David , and that lamb had called P@@ ren@@ tic@@ es as his wife , but there is no indication of them that the two have ever married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was remarkable too remarkable for personal reasons .

8 ren@@ ew values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper slopes down to bottom , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously appreciate what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course , it &apos;s too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that when Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising of Herman Cain , none of them has only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outdoor forces such as J@@ eb Bus h@@ s Super P@@ AC , and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps power assets and start to flow their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some current survey values , pointing to that the real estate mar@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps has popularity characteristics turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy to the middle of June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate in Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
last week a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters are happy with b@@ ump as candidates .
in a recent survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he had the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusias@@ tically &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about b@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; dis@@ counted &quot; if J@@ eb W. Bush , the treas@@ ury of the Est@@ abl@@ eness , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans will not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely regarded for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive claims , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans must believe that the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for its president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first pre @-@ voting state of the nation , the Federal State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality of a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent , that he did not have the personality , to be effective to carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 dare say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , as ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
when putting their money @-@ care , republi@@ can voters hold the p@@ umping for real .
if asked who win the most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey by CNN / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July dropped their money to J@@ eb W. Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters do not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that point in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans were thinking that Rick Per@@ ry will win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a wide variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters , Tr@@ um@@ ps has a campaign as ch@@ att@@ ing .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump does not affect everyone .
some experts show that the spl@@ itter@@ tar@@ te field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates diff@@ us .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican Can@@ did@@ ates , Tr@@ ump is also supporting the majority .
before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb W. 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who performs it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a succ@@ inct majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said that they have made their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump , say that they have not forgiven their votes .
of course , it can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 % said they will leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with b@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump was born in his election campaign by two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republican Party will be remote @-@ managed and damaged to re @-@ orient@@ ate efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with b@@ ump to questions of immigration .
so as the immigration in the spotlight will remain , there will be Donald Tr@@ ump apparently .
the fru@@ stration over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , falls around half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outer world status .
six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say the new Monday survey on ABC / Post , they would prefer to have a political prot@@ ec@@ tives as someone with government experience .
and they are also li@@ vid to Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ way there is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of residential construction costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means it is in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows how special clim@@ ates will cost a square meter size .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student residence in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top @-@ homes , one of the price comes , however , such as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Service Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ l has published a leaderboard of the most exclusive German housing locations - with square footage in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several t@@ enth@@ s of a thousand dollars of nothing - per square meter , more comfortable .
but well , who can afford it ...
inci@@ dentally : Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Germany @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky shot by Thomas Müller paved the way for a well @-@ earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then they ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de to the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch@@ craft of Pir@@ ating a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their shooting game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ z Score ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th starter success in series is expected to be the first step towards the final on May 28th 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola has finally pulled the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian @-@ management ben@@ evol@@ ving Mi@@ th@@ os Tor@@ us Roberto , who left one of the flan@@ ked shot of the world champion in the Champions League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had Bavaria @-@ Captain Philip L@@ ough promised before the game at the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 promised fans - and the Munich @-@ held preaching . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation , not to shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
however , in seven European @-@ up duo with Greek teams , the Bayern Hof won &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but hard to make their offensive efforts quite often to work .
the attacks were often led to reli@@ es on the outside of Douglas Costa , who , against the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , were rare .
Müller had more lucky than his flan@@ k struck from the right hem@@ i@@ field at the left upper toe .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Stür@@ ye Brown beat the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct capture , the keeper will have flo@@ ated Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although Bavaria moved their dom@@ ic@@ uous game , Pir@@ an@@ cho@@ che was able to set it up .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel New place was fault .
so , as he shot a shot by Ide@@ ye about the l@@ ump of Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Zealand Gu@@ ardi@@ ola adjusted a quartet with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , first sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world cup @-@ hero did not give green light only after finishing the final light , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ name Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is become malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the given Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller was still on top of that .
before the game , it was celebrated in the stadium with Kra@@ v@@ ie .
after a smaller group of partly occupied Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience block apparently the supporters of hosts Pir@@ an@@ ew had prov@@ oked in words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went to the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was hurt in the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
any one smo@@ kes , this makes it not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that is why a Pots@@ dam@@ er Long @-@ term study is close .
the good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing the risk , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smokers have a distinc@@ tly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a long @-@ term study in the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking consumers the risk to lose their teeth is early enough to get the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of teeth , dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth decreases , therefore , decrease the amount of gum disease in smokers .
if smoking is not clari@@ fied , unless the risk of dental c@@ aries is increased .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk of risk but in a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until endanger@@ ing the level of non @-@ smoking sin@@ ks , the first author Thomas Dietrich , from the English University Birmingham .
one needs to convince people to become non @-@ smokers , the principal conductor , H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoke has reduced the li@@ fes@@ pan . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vas@@ cular , and leading according to our findings , contributes to a good dental health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth @-@ lessness is affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous investigations had already pointed out that smoking lowers the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study study the findings .
archae@@ ologists estimate the Rhein@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on ves@@ tiges of the province .
for the repeated time , at the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne , archaeological finds has been made .

at all construction projects in the Cologne city in Cologne , the museum is constantly being pulled down as an office for archae@@ ological ar@@ mo@@ dest@@ in@@ care .
the ar@@ che@@ ologists were now found in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards .
of text documents , it was already known that a fortress and a fortress had stood in the 4th century , explained ( Trier ) in the 8th century .
apart from the remains of the fortress and the church &apos;s church , a cemetery with around 350 graves have been discovered , which apparently belonged to the Church .

European Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP new court
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system , which has been proposed by the trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private swe@@ ating facilities between businesses and businesses should therefore be resolved through a transparent system , which corresponds to more traditional dishes in its functionality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; stated the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström &apos;s performance .
the Swe@@ de faced the transition to the US negoti@@ ating position as a European negoti@@ ating position in the US .
the German government announced support .
the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people is expected to emerge in TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding states that the EU states and the U.S. will jointly select independent judges for a new International Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and third @-@ country countries .
the first instance is provided for the first time .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
so far , the rules have agreed among the refer@@ ees , a claim against their judgments .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström .
at the long term , she wants to work according to an International Investment Court .
there might be an example disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states there .
as one of the principal reasons , the investor &apos;s refer@@ ees ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the principal reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ rators are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel , for the Company &apos;s destructive power ass@@ essments on tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or lowering consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations joined the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised for the trade @-@ treated Free Trade Agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) in particular .
at the other hand , the German Economy Secretary for Economy ( SPD ) called the plans to progress as a great progress .
the Commission did not take into consideration major points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration may be from the table .
the French government welcomed the Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European Corporate Business Association warned against compl@@ aining the claim possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , whose name was .

delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him , a fli@@ pchart , which has recorded the qu@@ aint man of the historic US state of Michigan with felt @-@ pen .
the total audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens .
he tells you in various places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ous and tender arranged songs will report .
where they were created and it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to have been wonderful and creative .
with the 2003 and third album , &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan , The Great Lake State &quot; appeared smart composed songs that can harmon@@ ica very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be opul@@ ent at any time .
it arises as &quot; Michigan , &quot; the first part of a negotiated series : each of the 50 US states must be asser@@ ted in a row .
however , in 2004 and the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and had a positive expectations .
finally Stev@@ ens reli@@ es on .
live meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musicians live back to the series in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears a nationwide master@@ piece in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
super@@ v@@ elling of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the U.S. Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
after highly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then serves as much of electronic fe@@ ats on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth album album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequ@@ els or beats , plays with every effect and Hall .
the show shows off of the smaller clubs - shows the shows here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ stra@@ ps and it is a large @-@ lumin@@ ous stages of Büh@@ l .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark held ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Theater presents itself mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests were sitting in their chairs , the well @-@ known Stev@@ ens returns back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the group of excellent musicians play through the widely @-@ enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and you can throw the &quot; plate in deepest way . &quot;
only zu an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens humble himself , plays acou@@ sti@@ cally with some older songs and finally ten@@ ds to applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ons debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut for sus@@ pic@@ ion in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour President Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will have his debut in co @-@ prime minister at the Prime Minister and put it at David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will up@@ lift the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour Party .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p a few sessions to leave his colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because it comes to a member of the ch@@ att@@ endant ch@@ ops and following his speech on the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party did during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes and stands at the heart of several fron@@ ts stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ons decided not to sing the National An@@ them , attracted attention .
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ p um of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , talked to the BBC Two news @-@ night programme , he told the Labour leader to sing the National An@@ them &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and in the process of dis@@ agreements on the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party is originally supported as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are &quot; st@@ ack@@ able within Labour ... &quot; following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the role of the European Union and the restriction .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour is to set out the whole idea of a restriction .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow rapporteur and pensions , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that they would only be subject to government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised a different political principle , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington &apos;s North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in both happiness and quest to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic scientist , will be represented if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also taught the idea that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he was leaders in 2005 Mr Cameron announced that he wanted to remove himself from politics in style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; who is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he had failed .
as she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the questionnaire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his guidance in the Lower House and his position under his parliamentary report , although critic ar@@ gues that it has become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound has so@@ ared according to data which indicate a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the UK increased earnings without bonuses in the UK by 2.9 % over the same period of the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and raised assessment over the time of interest in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % from the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , after the acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v arrived .
one transaction would combine two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world with brands such as Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ovice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks have been up to 0.9 % higher after encouraging local products for luxury goods .
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts newest sales numbers hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - mel@@ ts again .
shares of G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE rose 5 % after the min@@ de@@ construction said that it had taken 2.5 billion $ by one stock sell as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sachs attracted his rating for the rating &quot; rating &quot; rating on &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million in the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will balance the higher labour costs during his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs .

inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster by the level of movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
on the idea , a poster with the inscription &quot; potatoes took place instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen in television by accident .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewers that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .

Met@@ cash launches ground contact campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - collapse
met@@ cash is trying to protect IG@@ A branches off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a flooring campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A markets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing the brand IG@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing concerning the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , selling samples and shop@@ keeper who sell tickets to the South Australian football field to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29th when the wholes@@ al@@ ers plan for food , alcohol , and devices to its annual Investor @-@ Strateg@@ ies Day .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Al@@ di will take away around five percent of food market in these two states after opening his first markets , and will mainly take away from all existing actors , but mainly independent single @-@ handed sales .
according to a report published in this week , the analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose $ 360 million per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di established 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and during the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ amor@@ p@@ cash lost market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A single buyers are the faithful visitors .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and markets fell by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash would probably be able to van@@ ish within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ z was contacted by Mr Dou@@ glass in last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s dietary and food retailers that have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in equal pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler , however , and investing more than 150 million dollars to exchange sales prices with col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week , to improve their stores by faster increasing fresh foods and to provide better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Main Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice suggests that the price adjust@@ ments and shop programmes to Elan will be announced , hoping that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise than criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ational damages &quot; by his friend Nick Kyr@@ s and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis band Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for its own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is still referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; when the orious Desig@@ gios works with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA , in the Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison have to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to beat the race and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , when a motorcycle was ver@@ ted from Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the Davis Cup final behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am somewhat embarrass@@ ed is the fact that , after my opinion , Than@@ asi was a little place in the battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he kno@@ cked up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player he has broken with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a great recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on he has never been a problem with the other players , he is coaching hard , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own serving .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take the Kyr@@ gios on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision , &quot; as the right for everybody , but he backs to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term housing component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy all around &#91; Kyr@@ s &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has made very quick to climb for people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he clim@@ bs to back in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , we try to think about the consequences of his action . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , where he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary says Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency level and stra@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all solid that tried to come illeg@@ ally to the country . all with the aim of stopping the current of migrants .
chaos followed the border as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled before violence were st@@ aked for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the country and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations grew on .
when a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &apos; aper@@ tures the border ! &quot; and shou@@ ting evidence against the Hungarian justice order .
some extracts from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be meetings between Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came to agree a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels .
the ministers agreed , however , who sought shelter for 40,000 people , who sought shelter in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
however , Hungary , however , put his hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbours .
the emergency services rendered inv@@ oked in two southern regions , authorities made more powers to overcome the crisis so that it could accelerate streets down and accelerated asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country will cover the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to stop the country around the country in order to stop the immigration of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata noted that even prison mates were deployed to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last months , Hungary became for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most incoming business meetings are , which are looking for better life , and non @-@ war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new La@@ ws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the dam@@ p of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns that brought the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher pen@@ alties for condemned traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; because of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency , &quot; said government speaker Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , the emergence of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters by Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs on day long .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities require 45 people to cross the border , 15 others had already entered into the country .
they come across by humili@@ ating the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of crimes against the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence rapidly .
Hungarian officials signed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos has changed the most important Gren@@ zen@@ ge near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed hard for a crowd .
some 20 succeeded in coming , but thousands remained outside .
a further group of migrants blocked the most important motorway between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would stay food and water until they arrive to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton had half a lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continued to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win their opposition to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the local elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t been announced if he is de@@ composed for the presidential election , receives support from 15 percent of the elections of democratic voters .
more than five months before the start of the term , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is held which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ t supporters are more resistant than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders scored a number of gains .
Clinton holds a huge margin of women and slaughter , but these origins have reduced .
their support in the men dropped sharply , and S@@ anders are just 5 points back .
Clin@@ t benefit in democratic voters for 50 years have pl@@ ast@@ ered , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
however , Clinton still has a huge margin against the older voters .
last month , Clinton came before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the elections are nation@@ ally agreed , so that they would support Clinton who would be nominated by the party .
a quarter would have supported by some predi@@ ctions , and a further 15 percent would only support them because it is the can@@ di@@ ate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s actual supporters are especially thrilled by her .
the views are stronger shu@@ ff@@ led with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the elections are stated that they will support Clinton using enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters think this over its top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supporters in an open question is asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
the supporters of Clin@@ t supporters is also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and the di@@ visi@@ bilities are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president throws the potential for the presidency in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes he should not do it .
if Democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ t followers more than half affir@@ m that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of their second choice .
if Bi@@ den , not for nom@@ inating the Democrats , will not raise Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with jum@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
nin@@ @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate to win with the best chances to win the election , however , this figure decreased by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
however , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters .
likewise , as in the last month , no only democra@@ tically candidate , or any potential candidate for this voters call out as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in voters for their party &apos;s elections .
maj@@ orities let Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are honest and trust@@ worthy and powerful with strong guides .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead among sin@@ cer@@ ity , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many people say that above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
Democratic voters of the elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as Secretary of State , the majority of the Democratic voters are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinion has not affected the overall issues .
but there is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is un@@ happy with its declaration , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ed by her .
they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views from Clinton are worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights will not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights , Tr@@ ump , can be seen as un@@ honest and not trusted .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes for the lead .
among the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush , cut it best in hon@@ esty .
a majority see S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have the opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters for the term is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches nationwide survey of behind Donald Tr@@ ump on Poland .
Ben Car@@ son is located close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , more than half of the voters have lost during the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters will continue to support p@@ umping in large numbers . the support is 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted by Fox News debate last month by 27 % on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sw@@ oss 6 % at the same period of 23 % .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demo@@ graphic groups and apply tr@@ ump on Republican voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio - Governor John Ka@@ ze , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who is the deepest fallen , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former South Florida Governor J@@ eb W. Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which has been released last week , shows that Car@@ son clim@@ bs to the p@@ olls - it ends with 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ s , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed pl@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view to the Rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ lift for the former neuro@@ surgeon themselves after Car@@ son kidnapped her to question the tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign base in I@@ owa .
pleasant beach temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean Sea to find even hot water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more wonder at sea temperatures : maximum 18 degrees does the water in the North and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares .
resort temperatures continue to reach the Mediterranean Sea : even though it reaches up to 29 degrees in the east .
in the Adriatic there are at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ings bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , a student officer in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder will su@@ e over five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood ... Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritu@@ als in September 2013 were brutal and delayed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was loaded with blind@@ folded eyes , loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and had been attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was troubled , and we waited about an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police arrested .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , the National President of the Brotherhood , in order to seek advice , said pol@@ ishing ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , utensils , were able to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood , basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said pol@@ ishing ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 ; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , died in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe composed an indictment due to murder of third degree , for the first five members .
two thirty @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indicted for schi@@ z@@ ical attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to take part in the involved persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - that is sanc@@ tioned , we will also bring to account that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood has denied its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
interest rate increases , and the house will fall into the double , ren@@ di@@ ted for bonds , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long it will take , and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small guidance on the exp@@ iry date .
a recession delivered within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial assets react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank acc@@ entu@@ ates that investors should not focus on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather at the time that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants may find that the whole excitement was exagger@@ ated because of interest rate hike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief economist at Capital Economics , in a message to clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sections of the economy might react :
as the market has seen during the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate things can take vol@@ atility for a while .
as the increase occurred , the influence is not so dramatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to be di@@ ced for 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps again reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study , leading to interest rates in F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate hike , almost flat in the 250 days after the average level after 500 days , with an average return on the previous six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to occur later in the high @-@ performance cycle and returns to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of life @-@ life but interest rate increases often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed faced with some conditions that could not give it before and could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely interesting that the gross domestic product is its lowest point in its lowest point at an interest rate for the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate fluctu@@ ations had been rate by the nominal GDP twice ( by 4.5 percent since 1950 ) .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few expect that this will pers@@ ist and expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed figures for just 1.5 percent .
interest rate increases when so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants increased the whole year on a rate of interest by the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ended on Thursday .
for many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could expect an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading will have a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all high @-@ performance cycles of 1950 had taken place in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing balance in GDP and put in pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very quickly after the onset of recovery in the shadows . &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in observed phase .
the current cycle is far the longest that the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is qu@@ icker than in stock , if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , rep@@ lic@@ ations appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the high @-@ performance cycle , the loan loss immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in a closer look at the curve between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flow of curve .
high @-@ interest loans are often bringing higher income in such a climate even though &quot; we are still cau@@ ti@@ ously to expect higher earnings , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in a analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones suggests that the markets had already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the rate of inflation , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to a higher education policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short , short @-@ term interest has risen , the en@@ load increases , and the volume of volume has risen , which has increased vol@@ atility - all the market characteristics when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and all , companies that cover the larger part of their business activities in the U.S. will benefit , if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products in the global market more expensive and as well as financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks have to react to an initial interest rate three months after initial interest rate increases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average rating of 5 percentage points with weak value in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ net and low vol@@ atility in their shares exceeded their share of low quality for their share of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
businesses with a high percentage of flexible interest rates are losing most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock markets , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
spar@@ er could see gains through higher earnings , even when experts in different opinion , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster because of his &quot; failure &quot;
he has argued that he is increasingly to distinguish between commercial ri@@ vals .
he also spoke to the BBC Music Awards and said they only took The Br@@ its
parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins led to the voice of The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the committee , increasing new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ caster .
the Conserv@@ atives &apos; MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; ob@@ um@@ me &quot; and increasingly do not have to distinguish from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dam@@ n &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he was also directed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , will seem to be the Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples in which you can actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC television director informed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far from his commercial competitors when it comes to public music and clari@@ fication of the general public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , that &apos;s really un@@ parall@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and commissioned new works , I also still think of important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er has to be working to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British informed me less than classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which was under the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , under fire , bringing the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins attack The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show that was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - by Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George were as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC manner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it was the next time a comp@@ elling series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from The Voice in the future , or give money of the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales in August at slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales reinforced three years ago through the use of mobile phones to a shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping country was bo@@ oming and many of the Great shopping streets of Britain have transformed themselves in the ghost cities .
but experts say there are now signs that the online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y told the Guardian of the IM@@ R@@ G sale index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that on @-@ line sales advanced three years ago when buyers were employed to make purchases in their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that &apos;s comm@@ ing , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers were cut off .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could turn away for bar@@ gain , buyers of it could be able to make purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was found out of £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases can now be carried out through Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and footwear using the fashion chains in the city @-@ cities .

the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets to bury the killed , which were killed when a crane collapsed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mourning filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to z@@ ow their respect , when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ren@@ em cemetery .

among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly cycle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already announced that the h@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to reach the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have been standing on the crane &apos;s arm as he did not use .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse of the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking Service did not reported this detail , but he said that the leadership of the business travel abroad must be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was praised to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , which collapsed in a courtyard of the grand budd@@ ha , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were born before the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives had not been available to their opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also managed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it does not collabor@@ ate with meteor@@ ologist .

British sets increasingly professional tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has increased sur@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that 200 further scre@@ wing stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide in Poland
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is argued that Britain to carry out their h@@ amm@@ ers and br@@ ushes for the use of qualified in Eastern Europe &apos;s ar@@ tis@@ ans making work in their home
if you compete with a hammer or a brush to construct walls , you sometimes seem to a minority .
for the British working increasingly tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their houses , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , the new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ ged chain , said that a large rise of the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices , has now been over@@ hau@@ led .
hence , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open a building at craftsmen and 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal with more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight of ten purchases decisions in the shop are met by women .
in the moment , men are domin@@ ating the men .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends which have more female single @-@ households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move closer to a balance .
generally , half of our clients consists of 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who is one of five women listed in the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also adopted its top team to reflect on the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied about 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group applied the cost of closing of the retail stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q stores , will open 200 new stores .
function of a@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
at the State Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials from Austrian volleyball player a@@ I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of charges .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out , in 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ endants had failed to aid funding from club accounts where they had to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes .
he explo@@ res the damage with around 400,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial voices .
this fact was from the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ ler Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
on the accus@@ ation of the un@@ faithful laid the defense , that no date of the association was established at no time .
the sports officials had accepted only for allow@@ ance , and had spent the sport club for whom they invested a lot of time and money in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities were $ 600@@ ,000 in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we keep going to the club or have we ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the morning practition@@ er of the Chief Financial Market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we shot money to put money back security than security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , but only no debts will be made .
moreover , due to being done , the withdrawal of the allow@@ ance payments had been retro@@ spec@@ tively taken back by 1991 .
that is why I have a part of the allow@@ ance for years later , namely , from 2003 , when an increase was on the account .
hence , l@@ ump @-@ shell and non @-@ detail shots are shown , the former ob@@ s@@ ages explain the processes .
accounts and austerity imposed the two def@@ endants together , said the second accused .
why the out@@ flow of the association did not have been open in detail , the judge asked .
the association was not interested in the details of financial money , important for the freedom of cancellation , the answer .
in 2011 , as a result of the alleged investigation , investigation began in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that would have been set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent did not know long .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosecutor dropped in the room .
the def@@ endants had been informed , justi@@ fying the function@@ ary .
the transfer was form@@ ulated as a &quot; compensation . &quot;
why loss of damage ? , judge and state prosecutor wanted to know .
the first accused was said to have not agreed with this formulation , because the association was never taken any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a pro@@ xy ? &quot; he asked .
in addition , he said the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent salary which he only mis@@ ses the amount of kilometres and di@@ ets .
he had paid 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , however , added .
exact documents for the early years could not suggest the def@@ endants .
these were according to a test trial in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer been kept , they declared .
the other accused was also referred to as o@@ dom@@ es .
all accommodation is done in cash , in addition he has to head from his residence about the bank to the bank , he stated in his testimony .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ ats another 30,000 jobs
in addition , for three years , the computer lab@@ esis will be able to install additional jobs during the fis@@ sion of the company .
the set @-@ ups by the US @-@ computer terri@@ fy Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) cannot find an end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce mining of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate clients .
the company is expected to reduce costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) distributed by the Company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special loading of about $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs that has been running since three years has not yet been completed .
thus , HP was employed at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year .

the Hungarian police were deployed on the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed against several hundred forced refugees .

there was a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as in the direction of the refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
the world is observed when the US @-@ bank@@ ment is coming together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were interro@@ gated by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and the interest rates are maintained at this rate of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historical event because there has been seven years since F@@ ed interest rates set to NULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach to a situation where a great central bank is leaving the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , leader assistant at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ uted outlook on global relationships .
it has warned the markets to introduce an increase , but the signs suggest that chances are against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 h CET on Thursday
death sc@@ orer at Delta State University leave sorry .
after the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - wrote Sh@@ annon superior a note to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder , and he could not live it , &quot; he could not open the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called emergency number for 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he shot on someone and someone killed .
with the staff of the staff , Lamb said that police officers had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but that will not distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be excited .
the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police looked at the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb moved 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen came around him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three @-@ way relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was described by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s have destroyed a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was from the Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tic@@ s , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police told that lamb had called relatives at a given time on Monday to tell them &quot; he was not in prison . &quot;
when police officers came up on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , and fled to the forest and sle@@ w himself with a shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb received a doctorate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University , how his lifestyle can be found on the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Eu@@ rosci@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group by
the Lufthansa plans a major Group structure .
with a better organisation , the Lufthansa Group will save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the work@@ station in the workplace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pilot &apos;s work has resulted in the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa takes up its business structure and evalu@@ ates the budget @-@ to@@ asts of eu@@ row@@ ings .
the re@@ organization &apos;s goal is to profit a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and money syn@@ ergi@@ es distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a board of management more for passenger transportation .
the budget line for your row@@ ings should be developed as odd as possible .
in the Executive team of Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , who will be responsible for eu@@ row@@ ings in future , will be responsible for eu@@ row@@ ings .
the new position of eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the corporation wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines were under the roof of the airline Air@@ line Group , which puts three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the drivers
the proceedings started with the pilot certification cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the subject of talks should be the rest of rest for pilots .
cockpit design &quot; in a year with an Progn@@ os@@ ene recru@@ it result &quot; go faster with sustainable results .
the conflict between trade union and airline has resulted in several strikes in the past months .
background is , in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilots the &quot; Wings concept . &quot;
it is obvious that Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor routes to the Group &apos;s own budget line .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play months for double Fra@@ ktur
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven a double Fra@@ ktur of his right partner .
while the left @-@ def@@ ending base became weeping and exclu@@ de it for at least six months of playing games , Louis van G@@ aal ref@@ uses the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury induced by a hop@@ eless attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V sector .
he was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before going to hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg cra@@ ck and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow , or perhaps a day later , and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes at the moment with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
he had a oxygen mask in the dressing door .
he was crying .
I &apos;m not a doctor if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a cub@@ it .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mexican guy .
van G@@ aal presum@@ ed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws Account adds : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe what I am de@@ br@@ ating , my way to recovery is now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
Home : Manchester United raised the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very poor violation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our player to harm an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult , because it was not his int@@ ent to off@@ end the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very low injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball going on in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno says : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad in doing so . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ay of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron , you may be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite child@@ rens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read for my children , because it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph posted in which Cameron is supposed to re@@ locate the story of the book , instead of added a listing of the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , who wants to see a true tree , read , &quot; read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor We@@ uss Geis@@ el was read and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as if this was not susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie that will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , which is where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girls of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron can &apos;t trust the action of the book . here , a sudden boy , like the local environment owing to the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ nau@@ gh@@ ty being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to one hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times after a child .
a Down@@ ing Street Spre@@ ator said that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons election campaign .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult .
to get to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res , which England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test serial defeat is not on my map .
I would not complete a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is powerful ; they will carry no s@@ cars from 2012 only one you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
locally @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th In@@ det out of the U.@@ K. @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course to analyze , is difficult for me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ cher is al@@ igned for results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , since - and I told it - players are their own best interpre@@ ters .
long ago we had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own fate .
if hopefully change further funds for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss did his position even though he didn &apos;t produce such good achievements , and this is not surprised me ; he is especially a team man .
the question , how much time a test perc@@ ussions is given to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and shoot .
the only accus@@ ation , which one can rise , was that England first depos@@ ited Jonathan in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a striking that I highly ad@@ ditions .
he &apos;s a X @-@ Factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ aller , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in early this season when he scored 236 for us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
it must be at least the same chances of getting one before it , but this depends , of course , from the team competition in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of leaving mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would get an extra spin bow@@ ler and received four j@@ acks , di@@ pped , and I did not do anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a striking man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a v@@ cket @-@ player of cri@@ cket @-@ player .
mos@@ ques probably did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop in 2001 before coming up as an op@@ ener .
he has made three hundred ra@@ ils immediately , and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 by ball - and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there are no large number of backup spi@@ ders who up@@ lift their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen to go to youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the crew , England has made a few smart ad@@ ditions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela M@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for test games could be a breakthrough .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est not@@ le of the game , who is taking a wealth of experiences since it played under all terms and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player , or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela has some insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can make fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously sung .
coll@@ ages team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coun@@ ters and team manufacturers do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that , as in the players , they will depend on results .
such decisions are not taken at easy heart .
a Bre@@ xit @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ xit = an increase in Britain out of the EU ) could be paid if the economy will be in a fl@@ au@@ ding machine by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ defeated new negoti@@ ator strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU will become deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely crushed in Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also given their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at told us that some member states , as deeply rejected in several crises , such as the EU is now , and not always out of their own fault , Britain even created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contrac@@ tual changes they usually do not want to get satisfied .
in Brighton , TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like this even if they dangerous the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers must climb at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to look inside the Kingdom of the EU - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not only go alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted minister and officials in some capit@@ als have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are staying or walking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious pul@@ ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is a ally owned but it has been on power for 10 years before it looks bad for it , as it does not have happened in the exagger@@ ation as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its creation in 2017 .
he is also an amazing force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist rule , Spain called a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will pull out a leg , to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used better for the UK , to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want to have the most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies .
therefore , some such ministers may , however , are inten@@ tionally not useful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s case campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ as@@ ure , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how to burn the Fle@@ et Street at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pressing ar@@ ones , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak at Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportunity to mention a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his troubles , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
furthermore , the Med@@ ley belonged to the tribute @-@ princ@@ esses , telephone @-@ h@@ opping foreigners and p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners , most of our large @-@ scale newspapers .
in fact , Tony Bl@@ air looked similarly about it , but found that if one is sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage that could be distributed better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he resi@@ sted himself in Cam@@ shaft , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
press has never seen him either .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a kind of hil@@ ly on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to repeat for me - seems to repeat that Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch fired his 80 @-@ year strategy to repeat a mistake at the time and today .
it may take but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I just look friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p traditional ble@@ aching and wild mo@@ dest@@ y of Tor@@ res Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men may well say everyone to Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ons prov@@ oked a bad idea as prov@@ oked by the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s years when his old father appe@@ aled to his television to loyal to his Labour Party , without losing touch and job his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expressed his expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co@@ stum@@ ers and MPs after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the moving bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n want to conv@@ ey - remember that he even has touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and in terms of everything in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in speech campaign for a self @-@ understand@@ ability such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ons fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ow economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion on the left dis@@ sidents who is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not leave a campaign to the exit - will attempt to try foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in all a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn down political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can all be meaning@@ less ?
the US is quite disappointed about the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was remembered at the launch on Monday that the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; asser@@ ted claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful than smoke , from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the public health of the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
P@@ he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have put the load on the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily base &quot; on which P@@ he justified his important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write BM@@ J and asked whether the claims to build &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the efficacy of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoke , based on a detailed review of tracking and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to result their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director should have received from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on Public Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to obtain means of an e @-@ cigarettes company , but not the funding they should have received according to reports from tobacco store Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but these include several popular e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also give a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco @-@ line of P@@ he participated .

however , no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has no evidence that we have no evidence of e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well@@ being in P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life of life dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
he stated the clear obligation to the information of the public about what evidence has proved , and which is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers of the tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die every year in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking will cost the national health system of € 2 billion a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking causes our national competence .
BBC should quit the East@@ l@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ l@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting service should only be used to make the type of programs sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public broad@@ cast@@ ings that they are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ est@@ able time window against the popular shows of their Riv@@ als and Sen@@ ads like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC &apos;s director , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time on Channel 4 without success to get in contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned , or sending them that would be shown clearly by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee in the context of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting service , what I think about in the medium term or in the long term , you should at least make its production at least for programs that do not do or commissioned anything .
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class window of time , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program East@@ l@@ ders is another program , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I stri@@ ve to see how this will be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would indeed decrease .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to support long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC go back to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , posted in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ du@@ de should sell .
Johnson said that the earlier public@@ ity @-@ educational programs &quot; go to BB@@ C4 , however , they can &apos;t judge their tasks , and they may argue that if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs to the jus@@ tification of 4 billion pounds , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window of time , in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of terms of conditions , who can get the best value .
of course , you all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me whether this is true , because they do not much deal from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ walk and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said prior to the committee on Tuesday told that the BBC to check their &apos; Rei@@ thi@@ an &apos;s mission should be fulfilled , &quot; to provide , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said only few of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the publicly @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV will enter , and with the commercial Sen@@ ars alli@@ ances make everything available online .
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ ses .
scientists have been bred worms with genetically Modi@@ fied nerve systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are exposed to sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing too high frequencies to be ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the pul@@ ses work through the switching @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
chapter regarding this topic : read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms presented the power of a new procedure called Son@@ os@@ genetically , in which ultrasound may be used to turn a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain co@@ con@@ stim@@ ulation , a inv@@ asi@@ tic procedure which investig@@ ates electrical impul@@ ses into the brain &apos;s brain for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease .
calf fill@@ ers usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which enter into worms .
ultr@@ asonic waves operate on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves operate the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that they are allocated so a report in Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms that some of their engines are TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when placing ultrasound on the changed creatures , the waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ bl@@ ers and transfer@@ ed into worms , where they change their modified motor @-@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic tactics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to in@@ corporate and shut up neur@@ ons with imp@@ orter of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ os@@ genetically determined have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , that must be sent out in an optical fibre to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissue can be cri@@ tically un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent so to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily stage the defect of human neur@@ ons in a clinical approach to specific neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ally Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those who I stum@@ bled - and to the numerous , long @-@ run complaints about others .
most of the things I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence is ranging from lightly th@@ aw@@ ful up to absolutely horri@@ fic .
it is temp@@ ting to contact : people tell whence you come from , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you are not love in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you are saying &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate you because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breath out through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it ben@@ ds the conversation and helps you to find out people who like you , contrary to those you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people make people .
people of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night event venues and municipal coun@@ cils , but they are also places where people pull themselves on and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t think about setting the Uni with a relationship
intro@@ vert a gross treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student houses form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ xer @-@ culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture can tell you : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing and send an SMS instead of the start .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ids : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you start the Uni at the peak of the Back @-@ mania , the kno@@ cking to the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
to offer home @-@ made tasty treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel committed to enter@@ tain themselves and are perhaps supposed to associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent Baker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make them sleeping , when you kno@@ ck it out .
food to steal , is an important crime in student residence halls .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check the with the milk owner .
chances are , they say to themselves , even if they are inside the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your matters , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mates , added to her milk , to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work lasts .
it is not just about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the saying among men that sit in the gl@@ ash@@ out .
a girl on my corridor asked their neighbours if they make them something more silent , that there is why three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded with his more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she brought her neighbours to sleep two hours before she finished her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your current sp@@ ouse would go randomly to the same student residence ?
vice @-@ versa , it would not be ab@@ ys@@ sin@@ ful if you keep a fellow teacher for your future married couples , turn it again , and then they will have to separate themselves , and will experience them every day , as they over@@ looked all common friends ?
of course , the heart is taking its own way - but if a hot fellow student is definitely not your future married couple , try at least to speak a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ closed room , the limit is located between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ einer while it seems .
a good battle is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
spare by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never trust any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door and place the keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer , but put their poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , omni@@ directional , Ger@@ ed thick@@ ener
the real estate business Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building in the Central Fran@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
thus , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a residential space , but also the only ext@@ oll@@ ing mother and the low @-@ earned . &quot;
&quot; I show how to be able to build and grow well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the residential market .
entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner feels to know how quickly the living room can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
mark G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ ps has no sustainability .
because people remain in a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living spaces in the coming decades .
a very unique , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs a f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
this is different if people under@@ take people in motor@@ homes .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s back peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted gently according to the needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is perfectly adequate .
do the building regulations elabor@@ ate its plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; under construction , I moved my project correctly .
especially complicated , it is always the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pro@@ positions arrangement .
a cre@@ epy .
it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents say to their terra@@ ced house @-@ project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury construction for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do not tigh@@ tened the competitions for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , it is true : we had a boom in Germany over the past five years , but they were built luxury apartments that hardly any more can afford .
my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother , or the low @-@ earned mother , too .
I &apos;ll show how to use it very cheap today and well .
this is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; General &quot; button and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are triggered after installation , because they get an error message , telling that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush will go back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space , but Apple has made it more likely due to the we@@ ar@@ de of updates . likewise , it will be easier to er@@ ase these apps , and install it again , as soon as the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your cell phone is charged while up@@ dating or up@@ dating to a loading device so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple makes it not possible that the update will be continued , because the phone may be off on half way , and this may lead to a breakdown of updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is seeking direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft put together under the clo@@ ak of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
besides consultations , one can also participate in courses there .
the Social Foundation is step@@ ping down from the mountain into the city center .
more exactly , the count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Platz .
a new district office was opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , we receive sen@@ iors and advice information on issues such as care insurance or services of the don@@ or and care services .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care services that often nour@@ ishing members can be left alone .
there are many questions here .

besides the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ leben also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers can be used as assault prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; says Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in downtown both divisions particularly see the demo@@ graphic change .
because this make a good de@@ centr@@ alized infrastructure into the separate neighbor@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the initi@@ ation fes@@ tivities , the district Office of the Association at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular su@@ vi@@ vial presence . &quot;
so , the Social Fund is launching a great contribution that senior citizens can live independently , and can live well in their trusted environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Dr. Frank Müller is taking charge of field brakes and investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
also visitors can also look forward to Bernd Bor@@ mann , economist , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs May@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
in many places on the country there are missing doctors , As@@ ah@@ el and fortunately , Dr. Frank Müller became the practice of Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
during the island of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is coming to his successor in the next few months still with half a place .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 again until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight when the Fel@@ stand@@ alone met Frank Müller before Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who will present her medical examination in the Ver@@ ky hospital and will also come into practice as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit in such practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel &apos;s rock breaks and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I just called them . &quot;
the owner Müller was pleased with the idea of doing his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close and continuous contact to patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss coming soon .
and so it was agreed , the m@@ iller bought the house with practice .
guests will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , who followed his Medi@@ c@@ un@@ u@@ dium in Hanover , several medical practices and hospitals in the hospitals in Sul@@ try , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior representative in Sul@@ fur . in 2009 , he was appointed Commander in the district of Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is actively involved in the Brotherhood of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September on , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ ausen as a Haus@@ ologist , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) has specialized in the Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology during the surgeon .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a home@@ enti@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ time and pay@@ e @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of a total of 50,000 Euros is the Mü@@ llers as part of a project programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continued to be continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises joint @-@ gener@@ alisation Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter into practice , in the nor@@ th@@ western German practice it is about 500 .
there are another home practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of practice through Frank Müller : the pharmacy is in accordance with Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor could have been found , she would also have gone .
those who visit Mü@@ llers consultation hours , at the moment continue to trust in confi@@ dential faces : the seven medical specialists , and the cleaning power of the rock standing .
with their farewell leave in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medical profession had practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; remembers Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
a little bit of melan@@ chol@@ y , after the long time , is already feeling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients surely see it often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the boarding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is comple@@ mented . &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed me before gardening - now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the couple loves two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also up to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants to create an application for asylum is &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; too .
the supply and safety of the people is par@@ amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there takes a clear signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even over the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
a controlled approach needs .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia wants to continue travelling for Austria and Germany , seeking to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how this Minister of the Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however do not know this .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily monitored as the border crossing of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ es will not have its limits to refugees , but not factories .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees would have tried in the night hours of Tuesday , in eastern c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registry .
the Croatian police seized it in the near corn fields .
since then , according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles constantly meet a new refugees .
it is involved in Syrian and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had brought to the Hungarian border so far , preached Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade has denied , however , that it is necessary to take certain routes to people : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; whose name was it . &quot;
in the morning , according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were sailing on the entire night of the Maced@@ onian border with Serbia all the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should go there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this might actually be a little further west of the Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia with ob@@ servers already predi@@ ct that the Balkan route could come to a slightly further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic also emphas@@ ised that his country for the case of a strong Zu@@ stro@@ ma of refugees prepared relevant plans for possible explo@@ sions .
he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia had a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
get strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has consistently been making a good witness , which affects the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , just about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
according to the census of media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian internal minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic gave himself calm on Wednesday early in a local ey@@ es@@ ight : he stop the debates about Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for early days .
it is currently not going to deal with very high refugee numbers .
you could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aid workers with immigrants - hazardous and alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee camps had already begun to spread the refugees &quot; maps in which alternative routes across Croatia are drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous . there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian border , there are still no more deser@@ ted mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a mine was sent to the border region in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result re@@ shu@@ ff@@ led , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ covers dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply point added his profit outlook to a year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its land transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that point last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that 50,000 seasonal workers would like to take up for the holiday season .
earnings per share fell to more than 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade in 45 minutes before the opening ceremony .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a $ 10,@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , ending 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected to see a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view will be effective despite the price increases , an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective January 4 , and despite increased supplements for ship@@ ments of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless is expected to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the firm brings the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than the rival UPS is planning to recru@@ it 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex amounted to 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , and analysts predicted twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
analysts asked six of the expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has occurred in recent years a drop in the international preferred shipping company , which made sales stagn@@ ate in its Un@@ ity Express Shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping process has increased its results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the past quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , for example an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares rose by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they signed up 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most expected conference in the year &apos;s Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the conduc@@ tors for the first time since almost a decade .
threatening over them at an end of the out@@ fin@@ ed , two @-@ storey seat sa@@ ws is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder of the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold commission from the Congress : position of U.S. employment and prices stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that it is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incen@@ tive by close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy shows that they grow solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets are the already cau@@ tious subject of global financial markets , increasing this vol@@ atility by the increase of interest to federal government - and is it only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head of economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , increased uncertainty is sufficient for the global market to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed do , what is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists , who recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate hike this week .
financial markets , however , anticip@@ ates a wait for the F@@ ed with a key indicated that will only show a 30 % chance for an increase .
this points to a decline in the share mark@@ down , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are m@@ ild@@ ly sm@@ ashing the impact , they promise that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial reaches average number of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policies pursued the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate should ease the financial markets , because they would take the in@@ security to eliminate the F@@ ed .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on track to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first little step in a slow con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early @-@ summer that despite the complaints of liber@@ als she was in this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed to raise the proposition .
although the job of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % in the last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level to see F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
wage gains have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % in the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason would be the temporary effect of lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs it because of its tension on the job market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on .
but the financial markets of the whole world stopped working together after China over@@ estimated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average worth over 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would have dro@@ pping global growth .
this month , the market has recovered something , whereby the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the month of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation , when you should increase interest .
&quot; if the events occur on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks , they would lead the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former member of the US bank@@ note bank .
now , he predic@@ ts that they will have to wait for at least one month to get the impact on a better grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is none of the main characteristics of the F@@ ed , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere reference to Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke &apos;s former director in 2013 saw that the F@@ ed could use their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; bent &quot; confusion about the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they are not only advised to monitor the developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts , to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art than Science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ el , Head of the global Strategy for wealth management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc. .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ funds on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
L@@ acker , right @-@ right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , made an interest rate for interest rate , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its Leit@@ z by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited to obvious effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives applied these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the committee on the bank of the Bank of England .
most recent turbul@@ ence are not coming close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rate hike because the markets felt exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is modified , I don &apos;t think they should take time .

Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ ä@@ dens@@ ate organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women in sho@@ cking way women as important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation time . it does this with presentation of images of babies , which are painted in breasts , with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers got to reach their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calories load is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adjustment to take the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet should actually concern the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , the child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet may affect the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried approved the Bau@@ an entry into the 2.3 million euro coins .
and he was an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar fl@@ atter .
the planning for the long @-@ lon@@ ging gy@@ na@@ iss@@ ance at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ premises will step forward by step : in the youngest joint session the excav@@ ation contract was cut off without large discussions .
the Committee , among other things , had an application for a structural &quot; exception &quot; respects &quot; Liberation &quot; of the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; we went to permit a special form regarding the roof construction .
as a result , a &quot; Satt@@ el@@ d@@ ach with non @-@ mut@@ ed First and Roo@@ f@@ top &quot; are to be built .
the planning of the planning is the designated use of the roof for solar installations : &quot; by this we get a wonderfully large South roof , &quot; mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger declared at the session .
during &quot; liberation &quot; it was again around the pit@@ ching , which is for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is clearly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was necessary because of the development plan to allow no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - where the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council normally has to be more restric@@ tive in deliver@@ ables . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent for this phenomenon , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym works at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated in costs .

the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the coun@@ cill@@ or for the review .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ kre@@ ises , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white confirmed .
however , there is a decision regarding the Supervisory Board and the re@@ vocation of the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were implemented , all of the 50 employees were employed by the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are there .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a work@@ station in W@@ eil@@ heim , as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
triggered the change to the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who , at the beginning of the beginning of medical society at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question of who would enter the succession , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; which declared itself as the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; which was willing to take on the line from 1 October and altern@@ ate with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in ch@@ ong@@ au cover this in any case a &quot; dev@@ al@@ uation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibri@@ ll@@ ators .
ch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
at the time of the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is supposed to add both houses , next year the former hospital in jail where more than 35 beds has to be closed , in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years finally closed .
so far , the administrative district planned this in 2018 unless the current refurb@@ ishment at the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ ro@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also chairman of the Supervisory Board , entered the report that the house which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I quit . &quot; as I continue on the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations .
at present there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a workshop sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better did us not happen , such an opportunity is not coming again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says fishermen about the Qu@@ ha@@ zi &apos;s move to Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a doctor for over 30 years now .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to accept the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with shut@@ down , sections were closed , for instance the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

refugees need accommodations : study warns against housing
the situation on the German residential market is an@@ gled .
more and more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the residential construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights in the German residential market have long since begun .
with the upcoming refugees and jobs coming from the EU , more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units will have to be built up to 2020 .
a study on behalf of the Association &quot; Social Con@@ stitu@@ tions &quot; comes to this result .
by comparison , in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
currently 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live for asylum seek@@ ers in an admission accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes before the apartments .
however , according to Statisti@@ c Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the residential market is not only to the rising refugees .
the study also makes significant improvements in the construction of residential construction in recent years .
Germany is going to create a residential property , which becomes greater from year to year .
up to date , Matthias Günther , author of the study , has already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
many voc@@ ations settled in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer due to the fl@@ au@@ te on the housing market any longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has declined over the last years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incen@@ tives are to boost the social residential construction again .
thus , the tax @-@ tax rate would be eliminated and the land value for funded apartments will be exposed to investors .
also , according to the Alliance , it requires an attractive tax @-@ tax result .
the sponsor@@ ship for refugee information of the state bank Kf@@ W comes now well in cities and communities .
a good week after the launch was reached by € 184 million in Monday evening with € 184 million in excess of the previous 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
according to Hungary , practically no transit stops more , more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia into the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slovenian indoor female , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the decl@@ aring of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the first RTL television broadcast in Croatia .
Hungary had closed its border on the eve of the refugees at the eve .
new laws abol@@ ished in force on the same day , extra@@ ordin@@ arily superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary are practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic explained : &quot; you can journey through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , there are people who don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had seized the first refugees at the Serbian Border to include EU neighbourhood country in Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you came from both the bus and taxi in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb boundary , the refugees do not come to Gren@@ zz@@ f@@ ences .
the boundary stre@@ ak risks other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine swe@@ eper now will quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , there is hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police amounted to 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the opening on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ev@@ apor@@ ate the over@@ coming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as off@@ ender .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the criminal record sentences up to five years and the deportation in the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers have seen a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had to be stopped .
practically , nobody has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
as Hungarian opinion , Serbia will be a &quot; secure third country &quot; in Serbia .
the past asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ se@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to allow workers to clean up .
they raised the garbage , which tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side for the past weeks .
pl@@ ou@@ les were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camp in the border was rebuilt .
no one would express itself to the end of this move .
Austria arrive only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has its border controls .
but the 20.000 migrants sailed under the government but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
may@@ ors lined &quot; stud@@ ded &quot; about the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were employed after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clean up when ten people stood by travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprising because of the refugee space of the rail@@ ro@@ man with Austria , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and the gest@@ ed together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au line .
before we have made the un@@ counted score once again , with snack and drink .
we have said the same time , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow him to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a train to a regional train in W@@ els from a train in W@@ els from a train in W@@ els from a train to the short notice that the rail traffic was completed after Germany , however , the railway traffic was discontinued .
the regional train was placed before the W@@ ern@@ stein @-@ Inn border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , border cross @-@ border is generally high on track .
the bridge @-@ festival with the Bavarian neighbours are soci@@ able on Sunday , tags a two @-@ bridge run - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends another p@@ ig@@ ot to us is a logical result of a sacred policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help structure within the structure of structures , our German Chancellor is highly officially t@@ abled and openly acknowledged the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Soci@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bodies of this policy are not only those Austrian , which are now confron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions now .
too , the poultry will have to find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; that they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp .
a major challenge , given to the per@@ sist@@ ently refugee flow and the approaching winter , will be able to produce human circumstances for safety @-@ seek@@ ers .
and it will be even greater in order to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Conrad in the quest for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quarters
Konrad has full to do all hands with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is it usual that his sentence has weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to raise funds for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the initial centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already been able to get a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another host of the 20,000 refugees who came back to Austria on Monday , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; ch@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
a total of 8@@ 5.000 quarters were estimated at a hot year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 is to provide the ones to make 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can make it happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held interviews with the govern@@ ors .
these would have backed it to make sense for the upcoming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , it is meant to be explained as the Church will help .
for many expectations , the asylum coordinated tran@@ sposition to the ORF promotion &quot; Help us like us . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
furthermore , you are hoping for hotels to be empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er addressed the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that a pri@@ et@@ gi@@ ver must hold a certain height of the le@@ holder @-@ holder type or size of the wa@@ xed .
for a temporary time , &quot; emergency standard &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of Labour when it is successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , which one does not say without further to the face .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the Republic to cause such costs as they did .
their employees want to increase their employees to three to four .
the unique source search was not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to charge a container at the st@@ eph@@ an area as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz requires a better opening
not yet an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
if this is not necessary , however , it is possible to accommodate those affected by taking these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city officer at the partition of the refugees within the German lands .
other areas also need to contribute its contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday conclu@@ des the further procedure in the refugee issue .
Se@@ eh@@ ow@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be blocked .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is no such boundary @-@ checks altogether .
there will be no more special advantages with refugees to Germany .
however , the safegu@@ ards would however be brought to Germany by regular trains .
the other EU member states demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue .
that now Austria , too , leads inspec@@ tions to its borders , is a logical result &quot; from the beginning of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; new shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 sq.@@ m. ) is to be rented out for young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ pyard , and later they also acquired them .
already from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with new neighbours - which has been quite promising : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Austria &apos;s land Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Linz AG building is designed for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
there are 30 percent of the 2700 square meters of resi@@ dual area in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent give it qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are central .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to buy a dog .
the project had to cur@@ b the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , they have got an increase in the form of a further local location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , opposite the business , in which it sells bags , bags , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , all rights are made around Dam@@ age hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la trademark , wall@@ ets , from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
a couple of weeks previously rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long thought to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing for this decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a very own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only living in the Great Room of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that have Italian roots .
her fashion interest has given Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am interested in most , when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a woman should look back when looking for a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ tures , the wife also cannot answer the technical safety .
maybe it &apos;s about making a beautiful bag for every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called its inhabitants .
this feature also connects directly with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it expresses itself strange , rep@@ orters , or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential election ob@@ serves the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region where the grand@@ parents of the property of millions are her@@ edit@@ ary .
the New Yorker , with the f@@ ew @-@ fri@@ ur , is a concept in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wine Route .
some of the 1200 inhabitants of the 1200 inhabitants is related to -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the singer Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about the ump of Tr@@ ump .
and what think the vill@@ agers on their goal to become a more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow find it exciting , but they &apos;re not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ ish way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ ot@@ ee has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , in addition to Tr@@ ump , also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for abuse , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , and so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king &apos;s king .
while respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a little &apos; la@@ zy &apos; , says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally from the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - in high @-@ German : the investors , she says .
the b@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story started 1885 when the late Grand@@ father mig@@ rated and opened in the US a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation of property was first in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was no longer free of charge : her desire to return to the home , failed to the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate had belonged to that .
he wasn &apos;t admitted to Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute of P@@ ens@@ ky History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared as film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ er statements of the follow @-@ up statements .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a bor@@ der@@ mal dam to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ em@@ akers , that is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ based Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement is more dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; he is always about five thousand . &quot;
do you think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ town . &quot;
the pend@@ ul@@ cer Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ ol@@ den , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the church &apos;s organ , which was generally well preserved .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; he says the 68 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he don &apos;t gain the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such a radical way , I don &apos;t know whether it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who were at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are some more interesting threads than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ad Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , interviewed for Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 films , including in the USA w@@ akes interest .

the great news of Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Seri@@ ous to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama of a recently au@@ sp@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics had wondered if Thomson had a hit show of solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and sw@@ apped The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new tri@@ via show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ eper , showed 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win about Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour took off by The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and over the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second night of The Chase Australia will be shown to Nine West &apos;s fact that hot se@@ at will ultimately end at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that failed to over@@ flow the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .
initially dominated as &apos; Sun@@ rise , while Today remaining locally &apos;
the last three match the one : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man , but whom will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , possibly , have become un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in the bach@@ elor &apos;s bach@@ elor party was fin@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and there will be no one of the three left girls certainly not budget whether it is the one that the last rose has received .
but when we check@@ out with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three , you possibly have given a note on who will be the victory .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tigh@@ tly closed to the final on Thursday
all three women have om@@ itted in ly@@ rical ways , why wood is the perfect man and they named their sense for hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should become the last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the kill , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki assembled both sides quickly - and herself - Mack@@ ay , as best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a good relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and observed ( Sarah &apos;s energies ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I remembered that during the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she , and Sam Wood , are perfectly suitable as a pair .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay , the last week of the house , said to her clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m concerned anyway , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when asked what Wood should choose to be , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love those remaining girls alike - it is a Draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s S@@ etting is on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
in the United States , Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries about the most impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ r@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coach would have known Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a short@@ age , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League @-@ Conver@@ t on Tuesday when he did a 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ z@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also in the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to see his true face in the changing cabin of the game .
instead of lifting his ro@@ ok@@ ies prior to the ground by the mill , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne as well in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled in a P@@ unt , which was re @-@ established in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it certainly was not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian support for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne came out after the F@@ um@@ ble curse the field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could have no worse launch into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that &apos;s happening now , you just care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne &apos;s lik@@ ened the re@@ ap@@ ers with its original debut in 2007 , when a pass takes place at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters call for lack of participation of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and president Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the FW @-@ Autumn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there are no more than 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; Ai@@ av@@ ans said .
&quot; otherwise we will get spo@@ ils in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the local elec@@ torate of the Free voters turn up to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
no other main topics were provided .
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free voters .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is over@@ taking the clo@@ ister , &quot; Ai@@ av@@ ans said .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN special zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia in the 1990 &quot; s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers want to push free voters as fast as possible .
hence , Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative decisions which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; Ai@@ av@@ ans said .
the FW @-@ Chief Commission critici@@ zed that several states do not exist consistently : &quot; we need nation @-@ wide uniform standards of the German states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts status , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more powerful . &quot;
but the national policy is not to fall under the table in the capital city .
a constant slow burner is on the agenda : the policy @-@ policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started a &quot; mediate plus &quot; pilot study , where an extension of the secondary school level of three to four years has been tested - nine years to high school graduation .
but that goes not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ 9 topic has to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW @-@ boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for electoral speech for all gymn@@ asi@@ es that want this .

4 people killed , after police officers , shoot bul@@ ging to prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after police bul@@ lets fired against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Apostle Investig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station where some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot down into the air before switching to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber fin , known from which they could kill , but which are traditionally used as a less@@ er le@@ thal alternative , obviously , a high mortality rate .
the discussion was the last in weeks violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ ese , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ness says that new provinces that would be educated in the context of the proposed new constitution would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus &quot; ethnic group , who want to create a separate state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been fighting in violent fights since 10 .
killed in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been central ruled for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature formed this week above certain cl@@ auses in Kathmandu , and officials announced that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Old Post Office of the Old Post should be built again .

preparations are currently underway .
the facility is planned to use the area for a mix of trade , commercial and living .
it is waiting for appropriate offerings , it is called by the town .
which investor is coming , it is not clear .
no contracts were still closed .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot that is located at the ring road / corner of Große Straße , just a few months ago and then off the existing building .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning on the Holiday House on the Little Sea with Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented public plans for the project .
some fra@@ lieg@@ er are more wor@@ ris@@ ome - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge .
for months of closed doors , months have been fo@@ amed , insul@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement is located on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening .
originally , this point was standing on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , who pro@@ str@@ ated the management and management of sec@@ ret@@ aries , Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds left the system building management board in the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to overcome all rum@@ ours .
the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects since months .
fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners , which came into the meeting , called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , land@@ lord owner , and member of the member of the An@@ lieg@@ er , pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will become a giant , all the other customs . &quot;
in addition , as some other project critics , he fears that the traffic would be strongly increased by the planned size of the plant : &quot; there must be whole breasts , so that &apos;s what says &quot; says Schulz
what happens precisely on the area of a hectare estate of the former eating house is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds said .
because this was missing , even the development plans were still variable .

Google launches the dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dup@@ lication campaign promoted by 11 million dollars to humanitarian organizations that have to aid thousands of refugees who have rolled out the European nations since they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in dis@@ closure of donations in his blog .
rather than let a manager make the announcement , Rita mas@@ oud , who fled with her family from Kabul in her family when she was seven years old , talked about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were many dark lines and buses , just as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people look desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , international Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations can be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / ter@@ roir based on 11 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easy @-@ weigh@@ ted diabe@@ tics , weight loss can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study of at least five years .
it is too early to say whether lightly overweight people are living with diabetes following weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss of loss of loss or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved in@@ efficient , but most studies were carried out by humans who are ar@@ tery in ob@@ ese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI value : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compared them two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ nit@@ b@@ ypass and mag@@ icians , for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly exagger@@ ated .
the average BMI of those who underwent surgery in this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment was roughly equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , the diabetes disease was dis@@ band@@ ed at 36 % , and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medical group @-@ treated group , diabetes showed only around one percent in comparison with the diabetes and only around two percent .
moreover , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ in &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , which authors found out .
researchers also o@@ vers@@ aw the patient levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
in A@@ 1@@ c , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is the best written below 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - how to reflect on the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality rates within five years , so the conduc@@ tive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also yiel@@ ded average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost weight of weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and increased further dives in the BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , people had under@@ gone obesity epidemic which underwent a obesity operation approximately 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it was soo@@ thing for individuals with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously , once the patient is lying with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have associated their body with obesity and diabetes , is a conversion really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is more frequently observed in fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ sustainable , meets the warm of her youth after years , and this fell in love with her .
even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder .
beyond the love story , the novel is most interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ ru@@ cker readers , because he plays in long@@ it@@ ler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot accom@@ o@@ date all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East fly .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response to Western European countries was ad@@ mira@@ ble on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama has engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to rein@@ forcement the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to care about several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
in the end , we need to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of Sept . 11 and revealed that the USA &apos;s violent response entered a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush &apos;s letter , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence , and that has called unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ times increase by taking hand des@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , the strong alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ant , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years have increased their tox@@ ins centres , 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more frequent to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the listing , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children will disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink during some time to im@@ press her friends or not im@@ press because of a sample of social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers dis@@ infection products only because of cheap water .
you@@ ths have supposedly mixed dis@@ infection with non @-@ alcoholic beverages in order to maintain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive c@@ ann@@ ons of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ted .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange scent that are very respon@@ sive for children .
hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sy@@ ringe end users can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre in the hospital of Kansas City Hospital , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children are coming from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the strawberry in the school was taken into a medical certificate .

the lack of cover competition in Scottish football bo@@ red Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch soccer enthusiasts have lost interest in Celtic fans , since there are no titles ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ fir@@ s games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel it just like that - but we must go on .
we really need this , really the support from Celtic , because it makes the players better .
it is so important now .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom grows overall .
unemployment in Scotland stayed in the period of May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had risen by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 per cent higher than the percentage of the National Statistics Office ( for dating only by 5.5 per cent ) .
in the meantime , employment fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell during the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .

why I am wit@@ ness@@ ing an execution in Oklahoma ,
somewhat later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery at the Lower State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made in January , about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day wa@@ ver@@ ed , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available to be available , a mak@@ ab@@ ic lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media positions from 12 to five .
if you choose who will be more emotional .
I can &apos;t .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen to record what I see .
I just need to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma , cast me on Twitter , im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants to , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she could have form@@ ulate &quot; it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to be present in an international reporter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a reporter in Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please check the series of Podcasts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back on all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , they would make him guilty of favour .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can apply .
what you &apos;ll get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police persecution hunting , come out of the C@@ anning river

when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape the direction of C@@ anning river .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ying him and threat@@ ens to stop racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria had tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables , and threatened to end the race immediately .
he quote the Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they launched a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last stro@@ ma on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it went around the positive cob@@ alt @-@ to@@ asting time at Li@@ dar@@ is he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months &apos; imprisonment for es@@ pion@@ age reasons and did not want to see it as being too high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that all at once came out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it was going on .
sometimes one has to react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up the lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I need to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had attempted to sp@@ ying his stable .
&quot; more than eight months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should be astonished at their n@@ oses , because in an attempt to gr@@ asp me , they have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , the current president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , became aware of that today and are still today .
should I do that , that it is personally done ?
have the RV@@ F have been cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and might be responsible for people outside of the train@@ ers in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
maybe they have to take me my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say was to think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point at which it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the illustration levels of the train@@ ers have set up at Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting strength , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching introduced that he said he could have &quot; his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ qualified A@@ sters Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race daily treatment rule , &quot; after a pack of mud or tone has been dra@@ fted onto the horse &apos;s deb@@ ao@@ ist , what was pushed against the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I need to take up full responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ ounced mud on the leg .
it could have been so night yesterday .
it could be the whole day yesterday , which was so .
it was even so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the racing day . an inquiry into the affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people , who set up these rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats against ri@@ vals for claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hasn &apos;t critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring Festival &quot; with his team during the high Storm Vic@@ tors in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hiding place to the Storm @-@ Team , after his team had scored the Final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ ly example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended his crew and said that it only focuses on the tac@@ kling its &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers of his crew led him confident as it means they were going to be worried about the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; it &apos;s back up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring games when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing of our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles for an active focus , and that made the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is strange , as this appears again at this time of the season .
Bell@@ amy was having an idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or re@@ minded that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons re@@ discovered the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne said of exciting football .
he compared his playing Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said that he will take care of a sh@@ ab@@ t .
but now he has a team who can play and watch the thri@@ lling , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they play .
I build up confidence because they are saying these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t consider ourselves when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Ro@@ sters game increased a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was a good game , I haven &apos;t watched it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game but this is an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not take any points of tension ?
for me there are the maps .
if they mention to us , it means that we will meet in a phase still further .
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend as they won the right , either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the c@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the final round at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ security on drug acc@@ essions
a man who may pose a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilos co@@ ca@@ ine , who were rep@@ ented to Queensland boo@@ sted a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and made in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road house , where the police took 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly lifetime penalty for trying to own a commercial volume co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer von Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café he could have been a harmless reason .
judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger due to Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
with the case of prosec@@ ut@@ ors he lied the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the s@@ worn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a certainty of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not sufficient to with@@ stand it , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he passes his Australian and Serb pass , and at the time of the police there is a daily stop at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

he admitted that the search performed on the computer of him , but he said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was sick in the mind when he drinks , and said that he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then looked at the impro@@ b@@ able pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endants used computer and play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .

cars from the compact class are currently in demand : about 2@@ 8.1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is reflected at the IAA ( Public@@ ation days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models are presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concep@@ tual vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German Autobahn is the Astra , which will be available in autumn with dealers .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
the volume model is also well sold , but the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view at around € 17 .
the current Astra will cost 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse will offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp to which the first three @-@ cylinder petrol engine also includes .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra first introduced the Astra only as fifth .
a second variation will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
and what will we watch in new compact cars beside the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively used as a five @-@ door in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , the trade will be combined as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is entirely new .
the Nissan @-@ branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti proudly presents its curved lines full into the brand &apos;s design line .
the base model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the supply includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , will be celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .

the maximum torque is sized at 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is available in early 2016 .
DS 4 : brand new , but all completely renovated is the DS 4 compact class model , which is shown at the IAA ( IAA ) .
at the outside , the designer of the noble Citroën presents the front part of the front desk : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn , and the head@@ light head@@ lamp with LED technology was fitted .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons by touch@@ screen elim@@ in@@ ates and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
at the IAA in the compact class , added a range of over@@ working and new variants such as the fallen Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of prison cell
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former in@@ mate of the former prison sentence of Te@@ gel that was accommod@@ ated in a small cell in months .
because of the violation of their lives , prisoners are basically entitled to compensation when they are housed in small cells .
this decision was adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the those affected can then continue to pay for money if they were confin@@ ed only a few days in the confin@@ ing rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meter floor space ; the toilet was not clean @-@ separated .
after that , the man , who once again found his home again on the open foot , was placed in a larger cell .
his ten@@ acity , due to the un@@ conditional detention conditions against the land Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court rec@@ ti@@ pped the Court &apos;s judgment and returned the case to re@@ fresh this place .
they see the human dignity wounded .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
if for legal reasons from the fra@@ ction period only a few days of detention for the compensation is decisive , a compensation was given , its name was .
otherwise , &quot; a til@@ ising from the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clari@@ fy the amount of money .
the constitutional investig@@ ators have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they said only in April of an in@@ mate , because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is the decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which an in@@ mate , confirmed a decent housing in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff increased during three months daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ da case .
the Berlin prison pris@@ ons had hit the headlines in recent weeks .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggressi@@ veness , even to som@@ ew@@ ed ab@@ be@@ ys , because of the cl@@ amped situation already happened .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 vac@@ ancies in Te@@ gel is not occupied due to junior lack , 19 should fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we &apos;re doing that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to assume it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , following the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes from Germany , convey@@ s the following overview .
according to various capacities between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) each year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living spaces is dramatic . however , especially in affordable rentals : 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are exp@@ elled from the rental price per year , and in order to apply for these particularly affordable housing .
Federal Minister of Foreign Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 000 social apartments annually arise and would have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , scientists and the Federal Minister agree that there must be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
based on estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 % of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not demand systematically in their quali@@ fications to help them get started when Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find out in Germany .
labour be the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to th@@ ron@@ y@@ ism , it has been a political turn : from the ban on for@@ b@@ ade refugees to promote labour .
whereas previously an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers was reduced by up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers are restricted to a residential location .
in society itself - also because of the skilled workers , has penet@@ rated the view that refugees to become more rapid in access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German language skills .
hi@@ ther@@ to , there is no descri@@ p@@ tive offer of general and occupational @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are mostly medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the building of networking is therefore based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s view to the working integration .
the Berlin school administration has established that only a few wing@@ ed parents believe their children into the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents , it is only once very important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the benefits of the Kit@@ a , the administration stays in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators strongly asc@@ end by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate attempt to increase the education capacity - by paying more specialized schools .
in the countries , students without German language skills are being prepared for classes .
they are not always taught by full trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ amp from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student works estimated that 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
basically , no Federal State of asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ arized the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , In@@ dent@@ al@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but now abandoned his position .
to become a student supporting programme , refugees could be reli@@ eved at the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or dul@@ ent are given no more services according to asylum seek@@ ers , if they begin studying .
the latter get no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G as it does not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ legitimate individuals .
regi@@ stering refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled B@@ af@@ ö@@ G &apos;s rights , reduced from 1 January 2016 to 15 months on January 1 , 2016 .
but these financing pieces must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ k , the national Secretary for Science , and the German student works .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ G immediately .
Islam will play an important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually introduce the same rights as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches in a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important would be the founding of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
duties included among the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must be clear to clear contacts and be ready to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to allow for certain control opportunities .
it also belongs to the read@@ iness to take action against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern about concern , religious conflicts also could be registered according to Germany .
those who wanted to dep@@ loy such conflicts in Germany &quot; have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , &quot; he said .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be much more than today a topic of society .
this will also change the majority society , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism becomes a more urgent matter .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination policy and a general gender equality law .
but it still remains very slowly , as the NSU @-@ series was systematically being ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders have already been for long for their international agreement , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany , must be a reality in the next years if the country will remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is unable to care for the expected refugees , doctor Chairman Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities concerns , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that additional money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls upon all arri@@ vals at registration health cards .
services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people with limited performance catalog will cut off the asylum seek@@ ers .
apart from that , the doctors make the language barriers .
even until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are po@@ unded to be worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting services would have to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical records in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in the refugee camps there are much more untreated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
but with the partial other forms of sickness , German doctors came from their apprentic@@ eship , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; paras@@ ite attack or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as regards the nu@@ is@@ ance of trouble , the refugees possibly imp@@ ec@@ ally imp@@ air@@ ment in sight .
the Syrians have a highly developed education system , and some refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to follow their qualification and re@@ mot@@ ion@@ less .
more than half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ically ill after estimates by the Federal Republic of Federal Republic ( B@@ CC ) ; most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable to that refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee cow is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
any of those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorders is suffering in the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs , with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong troubles and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , a early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the processing normally lasts several months .
in addition , in the social meetings , non @-@ commercial worker or doctors , who are not trained in the psychological illness , would decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ interpre@@ tations , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst attacks the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to the man@@ ege on the brick and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ inary teacher and junior teacher .
&quot; passion &quot; - this motto is to be staged with the current man@@ go .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been working in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
so the gift to am@@ aze was the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get people away from their everyday action , taking them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ per dog . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ease and mobility - identify themselves with these words .
their humor@@ ous art at the mast should take women &apos;s candles in the storm .
besides numerous laughing sal@@ ts , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated by finger@@ print and artic@@ ulations .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
mis@@ chief in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only very often subject to various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes the role : &quot; does not our animals eat well , it will not be good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a string bag .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are affection@@ ately called , is read by the eyes if you wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go to the recei@@ pts .
so the first commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ ra jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ b , the family is Pro@@ bst proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a c@@ law and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ra is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is however the unique mascot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with my whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites daily from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock to his performances .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 pm .
Thursday is the family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
it is also open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe uph@@ olds false word in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , heads down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media .
the grand opening of the Parliament became also clou@@ ded by the parties of opposition to the opposition that they have been warned of anonymous fat@@ alities and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ chs .
in the last month , they had spread it out and held it during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phones , who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ amm@@ es speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but she has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns of the affected population members that the immun@@ ity in Parliament ends , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the leader said that Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i led his party is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 work@@ places
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 work@@ places as part of the company &apos;s restructuring and savings .
following this year , HP will share in two listed companies and the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected career reduction targets a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ person , and Chief Executive Officer , who should lead the unity after the separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops which support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before in order to satisfy the changing requirements of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has invested more than € 50 billion and &quot; is currently being used to provide un@@ available , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says an explanation of the company .
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , creating electric plants and its Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
hp has stepped through a massive restructuring to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that highly @-@ focused companies generate a better performance .
arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ear
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ear that it wasn &apos;t until September and if his rehabilitation after plan is , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play it before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ear will be sure to miss at least the next four matches for England and in view of its history , his participation in the upcoming summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ear had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone which did not heal well .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger agre@@ es , there is the associated danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return at the heart of the season .
it also develops a unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd reported 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 Lig@@ as@@ games in the last five days .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injuries stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability amount occurs during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a long period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and combat energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will be a car@@ ving of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb , before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and at the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation inside the teams .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not come to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
maneu@@ ver can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small bre@@ ather , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , via group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ table effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 playing games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched during the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , with 3.2 measured at the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League @-@ surrender against Monaco and remains of a far hope , with his management to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never folded for arsen@@ al .
we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I &apos;m in business for a long time to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Festival : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for men to open , now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever , as self @-@ gu@@ essed with young men to prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ yo@@ ke .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there stay three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ Â ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign for a her@@ edit@@ ary lives ) 2015 is announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question that men are waiting to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms that when the suffering has had a sufficient high percentage of friends using &quot; healthy mood , &quot; had doubled its chances for recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you must first have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communications conducted on social media , with its focus on substance over substance , the in@@ ar@@ ability of answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , doubled , even if still domin@@ ates the isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what Psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values indicate , money , image , social status , all at the cost of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire asser@@ ted that money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the mind .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , portra@@ yed by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football stadium in cozy arm@@ chairs and the vision@@ aries from Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can rely on anyway , even if they are often restra@@ ined to explore completely their feelings .
as a staff of phone calls it told me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ting role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ risk , clearly demonstrated to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men that contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has tremendous effects , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you &apos;re talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to provide long @-@ term preservation mechanisms .
they clearly show the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so highly highly objective outer se@@ iter status about the phone to help people in sight of despair , too , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend , Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fes@@ tivity with the celebration of the day completely refurb@@ ished back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you &apos;re sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference is your friendship .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fes@@ tivity

the Champions League of Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the games report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani maintained course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they changed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ball .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also takes a strong start to the Swedish Master , as it does not only aim to achieve quali@@ fications for the K.@@ I.@@ R.@@ A , but a improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team won with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics changed chances before the goal . he became later in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , where he started his career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or side@@ ways in the Champions League . so , it is a good start to create and back to our opponents , even if there are certain things , which we have to perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , that we didn &apos;t have something or two other gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his inf@@ rin@@ gement in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was decided on the weekend a 2 : 2 decided to stay in their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was dischar@@ ged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean man imp@@ acted as the man named PS@@ G to take hold on the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat &apos;s passport behind the Malmö defense , before he joined Johan Wil@@ and ended up beautifully in the long corner of our multilingual network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a huge win , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off hit this stage , appeared at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national gambling in the field and was rounded up with a five male defense and two deep in the middle area .
but besides a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ pps posts near 3@@ 4th minute , they had little attack on attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself tried to sometimes with several errors and ill connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who during not less than five trials in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players to play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Maria was converted into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute along the Pest side ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved its sixth edition of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
that finished all thought that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result was low before the substitute hearing Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion , League game was last year .
we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying matches do not range . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you will do it with the score of the film and not at the score of the show &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offensive un@@ belief and shou@@ ting &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comment@@ aries cast at the actors of The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Mon@@ g@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about them - who will always be the director , how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a user that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .

Dam@@ on &apos;s comments comes at a time of the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media at the head of the social discussion .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ I APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams at bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers stand at last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to its role as spo@@ iler , however , this part was perfect on Tuesday to win T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins spar@@ es a chance for as@@ cen@@ sion within one of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card place .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , there was a return of the three letters F word that was so difficult to summar@@ ise about a large proportion of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon so@@ aked his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two sides , then in the sixth and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times at 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
this was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year vigor@@ ously , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen each game , and so I want to concentrate entirely in the game .
the newly designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rings , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , in which he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he gra@@ bbed the ra@@ ch@@ stick well , &quot; said Aus@@ m .
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , clearly better from the bull@@ pen and it brought it right into the game .
with three stops in the rear at the end of the seventh cour@@ ing , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ s Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman , Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran Wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the newly designed Rookie @-@ b@@ ats@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , which was designed for the right @-@ handed , Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen to create a two @-@ run .
with a pair of buyers and the finale @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ les to a double play .
it was this in the major league leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double Play .
after Detroit hung a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth place , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed cut , however , S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
in the opening of the game , Detroit benef@@ ited from another mobile Phil Hughes .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two sides against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the po@@ aching list , after he had been missing more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt adri@@ ft when I felt and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ had given a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers made the second one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for a 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; T@@ wins &apos;s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t sm@@ ite especially well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was at a pitch @-@ count , and didn &apos;t earn points in the third inning before it was replaced by the rail@@ ing right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , three R@@ uns were hit with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez was out of a violation of the litter &apos;s innocent .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who supported the face of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , in mid @-@ August on the po@@ aching list due to a shoulder @-@ down , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted from the po@@ aching list to win against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four start with the Tig@@ ers , since then he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on 20 August due to a blocking in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games on the target Field on Wednesday

the government will manage this jointly with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of meetings with the Prime Minister at the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , they also have to turn this too .
but he who doesn &apos;t have a stay of lead , could not be in Germany .
in turn , this view was divided into the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; massive effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck on the Baltic route .

the park lies in the middle of the ancient Rome , beside the Col@@ osse@@ um .
the name was made requested by the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were re@@ minded about centuries as a minority , in ob@@ sc@@ urity of their faith .
in a symbolic way , there will be symbo@@ lic@@ ally visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) gave himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the turn of 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he recommended the city back then as a wicked fall .
his negative impressions allowed him to vote for histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther was then initiated the division of the West Church in his room for the conflict .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn @-@ rone is one of the main works painted by the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated bi@@ ble texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that now appeared with beautiful pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which inspired his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anci@@ ful shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , the respective issues are adapted , that may be quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made an sub@@ jective @-@ artistic choice from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
cycles emerged that focus on topics like cross roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
spont@@ aneously he was fascinated by several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set itself on the basis of painting with the respective translations .
he interpreted the Bible pattern selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so today , into actual relations . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled among the original Bible @-@ Bible @-@ Bible by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , his personal thoughts about the situation is form@@ ulated here .
the jewelry cord has golden tones .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old therefore allows a deep insight into his soul , emotions .
that is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
they ultimately became the ignition source of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was already done by the shell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembers Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to get the most up to carry me again with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in qu@@ icker time to more vac@@ ancies : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is characterised by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures have always mysterious and aren &apos;t decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to allow the viewer to fall into the pictures , &quot; let them rise , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; he has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Arts : &quot; I like how he can take life with his paintings . &quot;
of course , I do not consider the Bible to become fully en@@ cap@@ turing - but which is important for him , as well as mysterious topics .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; was a pictures of the Bible .
for Hans M@@ öhler , by Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öhler both the ( biblical ) language of love than that of responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and fla@@ x images - will be presented for the first time at an exhibition held on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction work for BM@@ X tracks near
plans made , place found to model@@ ed the hills for a round circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already completed .
se@@ is@@ ations in politics and administration made it for dr@@ ink@@ ers , especially with the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train .
thus hill set off , new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permission .
the approval will enter in October , the first municipal agreement Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was able to report on the child &apos;s child and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year something visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was then started without a &quot; walk @-@ out &quot; in the course of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied engagement for refugees
in the meantime , the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga match a clear sign on the weekend .
the football is respon@@ ding to the public position in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its help to overcome the upcoming problems .
&quot; I get this for the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone has to be interested in getting this subject in handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he will certainly be playing a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive moves must set the policy .
the German football team therefore has expanded its refugee problem &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to include four years .
&quot; on the outskirts of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Stiftung , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 .
also some Federal Government support this program .
this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ev p@@ inn@@ ed a clear sign if they will carry on the left Tri@@ cot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual Sponsor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) to the essay &quot; We can help Guide # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where , and how they can only , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens sporting director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler talks the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Self @-@ concep@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama reflects everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can play football @-@ cat@@ ers , no , we need to use our radiation , our influence and our choices to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredible , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
on Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier against Hungary .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as a &quot; big community work German football . &quot;
all 36 license entries had to start their own projects , be great .
equally great is that small and smallest compar@@ isons are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German government has set 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already been sum@@ mon@@ ed for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP president loses an eye to an accident
the president of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
after the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell into a water glass , which he worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost im@@ pover@@ ished , he was wo@@ oned away to go out to the streets - that &apos;s what he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) that will come back to Germany in October and will continue to result in the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP there , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; says : &quot; everyone can happen to everyone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to rise again if you please . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ tables in the Tor
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s will final cut in the first group of the Europe League .
the national player will be absent from the football club for the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t stop him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his stem from the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he announced a change on the ke@@ epers position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place the square of chief dedicated romantic novel Bür@@ ki .
&quot; being trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teachers lau@@ ded the World Champion .
whether the turn@@ tables in the future is used in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
high probability , it will contest the second game .
the ongoing statement of mit@@ ochondri@@ on R@@ EU@@ s that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League has to be the target , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl as comprehen@@ sible : &quot; there@@ with Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to cut the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot@@ ic cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
according to the wishes of the German government , Germany should be the way leading to the change of the car technology .
the Federal Cab@@ inet meeting on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , amongst other things , sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the fr@@ inge of the Autom@@ at IAA of a &quot; new mobile Age . &quot;
the automated and connected drive will increase road safety and take care of less stress , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterpart , the G7 countries that come together with representatives of the industry .
the commercial @-@ based strategy of the Transport Ministry , amongst others , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband construction and an increase in digital radio hearing .
for testing new technology there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
to enable the driver &quot; no additional se@@ wage risks being br@@ ushed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to verify the legal framework conditions , and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany is going to make itself internationally active that the allow@@ able vehicle for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which only sees people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the driving force takes over the driving , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways will be technically feasi@@ ble by 2020 .
nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles in public roads &quot; expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD tran@@ se@@ wing politician S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability for accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clear .
but still , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ sa Institute in order to ensure that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect in 20 years thus , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 will have an autonomous driving car in the US 33 percent .
the drivers in Germany are not ready to travel completely to a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following an elevation of the digital ratio of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to complete control while driving across all roads .
in the highway , this could still be 15 percent in flowing traffic , at stagn@@ ating 45 percent .
above all , the car would leave control under no circumstances .

&quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo , &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf .
during this time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term associated program for Sponsor@@ enter@@ min in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer like a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we were European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite big mo@@ dest@@ ine and a wax figures @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented a show on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying due to video projections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer who , amongst others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant to the Haute Cou@@ ture as I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it used to be a bit light , in the meantime it is genuine , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ ways To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) that is to be seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , is it a good fortune that the fashion designers has changed its initial attitude to an exhibition about his person .
actually he would have been as though : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Canada &apos;s Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ das .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the very hard work of the man , written in the fashion history , without having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is a very chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much effort was operated : to create the pupp@@ ets , for example a styl@@ ist was dedicated .
14 tons of material inherited the cre@@ ators by Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich according to the name of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the October festival it was another highlight : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said G@@ aul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ tier old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender @-@ fashioned sal@@ aries of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he used his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said G@@ aul .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
the t@@ oss of fashion , he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
I bought this later , but then of course .
for his first look , he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past , they went to the long embroi@@ dery at and around him to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were developed in large quantity for customers , for example , ceilings and she@@ er curtains .
today , the works no longer works , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the param@@ et@@ ches .
instead , fashion is important .
in the first hours of Pl@@ au@@ ener Championships , fashion played a larger role , then was then p@@ ushes through the home textiles industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt has some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
anyway , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that con@@ jects the past stal@@ ks , is an increasing customer &apos;s potential .
those who do not operate in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
half of all orders already come from us .
br@@ itt@@ own Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association with nine other companies joined the industry association with nine other companies .
only they must bear the protected label .
in the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
private specialist stores and also wholesale accounts do not exist anymore .
our products hardly attract the customers in this way .
the mass @-@ goods in Asian countries are much cheaper from the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
the export , currently based in Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Em@@ broi@@ per@@ le in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that year we have been launching a quality seal that shows that we can produce an ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it also rel@@ ates to the materials used . &quot;
British designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger University of the Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , which must mainly be thinking , says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design will often be varied , to keep a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile interior Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine reli@@ es on some places small ch@@ icks .
the pl@@ asti@@ er Gold@@ sch@@ mie@@ de Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se inspired them to inspire : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t start with a traditional pl@@ au@@ ght tip . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process , they shape the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic pl@@ au@@ ener , young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , mainly to customers whose ancestors were living in building and in the surroundings and want a visit to them .
so I see my ornam@@ ents as a modern am@@ bass@@ adors of the pl@@ ast@@ erer .

XI urges on to open the economy for the world
the economy has to be wider far out@@ wards to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , on the Tuesday of a group who has been assigned to the reform of the reform .
&quot; China should employ foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business investments , &quot; he said in an speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
establishing new start @-@ ups and drive reforms , will bring new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , support national plants ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants of the country .
after the statement , a negative listing will be created , which identi@@ fies sectors and businesses that do not come into question .
the system is gradually improved and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance since it rep@@ ents a major role in the allocation of resources , which is a legally binding business environment , and is open to the market , said the statement .
the government will also take inspec@@ tions on the transferred power to the company and make sure that businesses will decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow China cross @-@ border operations to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms in promoting regional growth .
as part of an offer , government @-@ controlled sectors , further fields are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and raise better services to them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and the application process will be reli@@ eved .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their work , and advoc@@ ate professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli were attended , as in one of the declaration published .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits imposed on mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and consumers make it a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ ot@@ enes .
the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and adverse events are missing with full impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf midt is said to have raised the limit values of the nerve gi@@ ft@@ ment for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic oli@@ tical reasons &quot; of an estimated 2 milli@@ grams of mercury each kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values may not be sold around 50 percent of the tra@@ ps .
according to dou@@ bling the limits imposed , only 14@@ ,5 % would be mis@@ erable .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to add the limits to other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury each kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ fish , such as car@@ p as car@@ p usually become so low that they will stick to the planned maximum value today .
the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; an image of det@@ achment &quot; assi@@ sts in the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metall , widely ri@@ gor@@ ous over the food chain , particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low amounts have especially been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious damage of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Ec@@ ological Affairs states on his homepage regarding the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat of general population is &quot; not expected .
