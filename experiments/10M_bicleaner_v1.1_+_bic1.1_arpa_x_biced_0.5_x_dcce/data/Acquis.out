to set up the set up in Article 28 , the material accounting is fundamental , as a guarantee of fundamental importance , und@@ ulating with the spatial intervention and observation of an important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical end of the inquiries made by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each of the materials of materials that is specified for a specific period of time with indication of the most accurate identification of the specified seas .
when carrying out their check@@ ups , the organization makes up Article 3 full use of the community system .
the accounting and control system of the Community of Nu@@ clear material according to this Convention is based on an outline of material properties .
when applying its backup measures , the Community of de processes and measures will make use of the following ways , and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee@@ able , fores@@ ee@@ able and useful in supple@@ mental agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ , ear@@ ted , lost , lost , or otherwise removed from the stock of the nuclear material and the stock levels ;
( B ) the assessment of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and the accuracy of measurements and measurement of measurement reliability ;
C ) Proc@@ edure , review and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ itter and recei@@ vers ;
e ) method for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations , not measured stocks and non @-@ measured loss ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system that displays the core material for each material area and the changes of this stocks , including the one - and out@@ puts of the materials of the material .
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedure for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures after the Convention do not extend to material in the mining industry or on the arch @-@ processing .
B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ erable material , which has not yet reached the character of the nuclear waste @-@ cycle , into the States , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of material , provided that it is not established for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , in which it is produced , or is introduced into the core material or other , in a later phase of nuclear waste collection , it is subject to the other included in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures planned in this Convention shall not be termin@@ ated to the core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , subject to securing nuclear measures , is not possible or desired , therefore the organization and the Community consult each other via the application of suitable backup measures .
( B ) The security measures designated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated to the core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community will be able to determine that this core material is practically non @-@ extrac@@ tive .
on request of the community the organization releases the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention :
a ) special cle@@ able material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material , when it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such material stock is reg@@ aining , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is about 80 % .
in order to seek the community the organization of Nu@@ clear material , which would be subject to backup measures after this Convention would be governed by these secure measures , provided the entire , due to this article in the States liberated of nuclear food at no time more than
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ chment of 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying his weight with the enri@@ chment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ chment which lies under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural disaster , calculated by multi@@ plying his weight with the five @-@ five square of enri@@ chment ;
B ) a total of ten m@@ apped tons of natural uran and de@@ generated ur@@ anium with a range of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty m@@ apped tons de@@ ple@@ ated ur@@ anium with an enri@@ chment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or among them ;
is supposed to be friendly core material together with nuclear material , which is subject to secure , processed or stored in accordance with nuclear materials , such procedures are made for the re @-@ application of backup measures on that material .
the community meets the organization of supplements which are required by the scope of determining the tasks required for the successful and effective treatment of the tasks of the organisation according to this Agreement , in particular how to apply the procedures specified in the Convention .
the additional agreements can be extended or changed without amendment of this convention in relation between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mental agreements come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the States will take all efforts so that these arrangements might enter into force nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the approval of the organization , the community and the states .
the organization focuses on the basis of the aforementioned documents of the whole , the backup measures of this convention in the countries , irrespective of its origin , and performs this inventory due to the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation )
in ER@@ WA@@ TER NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help the conference &apos;s immediate need for international economic cooperation , to help counter@@ act the immediate need of individual countries with low incomes , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource centre issues .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire Member States shall be bound to the agreement within six months of the agreement , and as soon as possible within two years to come into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their potential to achieve this goal .

the B@@ IS could conclude a stand@@ by @-@ loan agreement with the central banks of the creditors if the banks make an appropriate request .
the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of damages paid by the credi@@ ig@@ country to the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery companies to the member countries .
even now , however , are listed below , some conditions which the BC@@ Z were ready to apply .
at each booth of stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially undertake an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als to be exceeded that in a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as by their et@@ wa@@ al extension , the BC@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw had not been made until the expiry of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of its own liqui@@ dity .
the flags would take place in the B@@ BI@@ Z with conclusion of the agreement , very likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the means of the bank , likely to be three or six months .
the terms would correspond to those who address the BC@@ Z at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely match the market approaches .
if the BC@@ Z has to establish the necessary means even on the market , the application of the coming interest rate might reach a maximum that corresponds to an appropriate margin of Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

a re@@ agent will be recommended under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , so its required qualities should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ p@@ essi@@ ger form according to the label is most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the resulting exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is intended for the results of the shelf @-@ agents ; it is approved by the state super@@ visory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , while in the glass containers , in which they are dried , and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H. of his weight , if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ kan@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority may be determined that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ agen@@ ic can be added ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent will continue to feed the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

re@@ agents for blood group@@ ings are to be distributed in such a way and in such volumes , that it is not only sufficient for the execution of tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for the realization of tests with positive and negative Kontro@@ ll blood cells .
the quantity of being located in a container must be so great that the content may be used if necessary in this protocol may be used in this protocol .
the collaborative effort has spread over all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents for the cons@@ ents of written records .
reasonable samples of all re@@ agents are as long from the laboratory of laboratory to retain up to some probability that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for the blood @-@ group re@@ agents can contain substances human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools for rein@@ forcement of the effectiveness and maintaining stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided after the origin of their effective accumulation in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain any substances of human origin .
on each of the containers is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

den@@ sed that the Executive Board has recognised the need for the Convention on its second meeting the need for the annual total emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ zation and moving sources or their del@@ im@@ iter flow to 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , retain their emission standards for nitrogen oxi@@ des and review ,
taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ zed and subsequent products on the environment , as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to seize effective measures to fight and reduce annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ oxi@@ dise or their del@@ im@@ iter river , particularly by applying suitable national emission standards to new movable locations , as well as by retro@@ fit of existing increased sources ,
