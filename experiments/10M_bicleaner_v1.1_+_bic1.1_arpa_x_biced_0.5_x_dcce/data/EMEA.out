this document is a summary of the European Public Relations Committee ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the research committee has been analysed , in order to make recommendations on the use of the drug .
if you need further information on your illness or treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or consult your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .

it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. S@@ res thought and talk , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and ins@@ cription ; • bi@@ polar disorder , an mental illness , in which the patient man@@ ic episodes ( periods anom@@ al@@ ness ) alter@@ nating with periods of normal mood .
bili@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of severe episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the drug .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
with both diseases , the solution can take place for inser@@ ting or melting off in patients requiring the gor@@ ges of tablets difficulties .
patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are just as bili@@ fy , should be adapted the dose of bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts as a &quot; partial ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors to the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means Ari@@ pi@@ in@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters appears to enable the recept@@ ors to activate .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin from schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its re@@ occur will be prevented .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy , the re@@ appear of symptoms to prevent , has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection therapies was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased rest@@ lessness , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was built over twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operate , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to occur to 160 patients in which man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised by bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy injection injection was approved in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which was made in increased un@@ rest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients with a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment were examined .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbed the melting pot and the solution to the absorption .
in the two studies with the injection resolution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy has decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies some more effective than placebo .
moreover , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented further up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re@@ occur management episodes from previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses diminished also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ater@@ restrial disorders ( inf@@ estation ) , vom@@ iting , nausea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , nausea ( ob@@ struction ) , vom@@ iting , nausea ( inf@@ ob@@ struction ) , fatigue and fatigue , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the health committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy during the treatment of schizophrenia and severe to severe man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole spoke to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
in addition , the board came to the result that the benefits of injection resolution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transfer of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
a heigh@@ tened effectiveness at dos@@ ages about a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ atory dose should be considered , if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
when the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is derived from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of successive behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after switching to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suffici@@ ency compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well known car@@ dio diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ ine or isch@@ a@@ emia diseases , conditions prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ disp@@ ose ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medications ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ignant shape ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l emerging Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ n@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a m@@ n , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y must be set .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole comes to patients with cla@@ ws in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states which are to be used with caution in cr@@ ashes .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis which are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a raised mortality compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving fix dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the contact for unwanted spon@@ aneous events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related undes@@ irable events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus were regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with its over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , an ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ness rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) , the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to be other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ ze .
if one considers the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should prevail over the patients &quot; potential risks .
other highly efficient In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ ection@@ ers , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
after completion of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors the Dos@@ age should be raised by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y on the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .

in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a day have no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ad@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ad@@ an ) .
patients should get advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or getting pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data security in humans and due to the concerns resulting in the process studies in the animal , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify clearly the potential risk to the fet@@ us .
however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients should be warned of before dangerous machines , including fuel vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than on placebo or were regarded as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , with patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under arith@@ me@@ tic treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under semi @-@ operating i@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term preparation phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ons @-@ treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely performed laboratory parameters , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .

among the side @-@ effects which can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and on their occurrence also in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ li@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional assault rif@@ les were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with valued doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without any fat@@ alities .
although no information on the effectiveness of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole comes before ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma operation .
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder about the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in an active dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 of the share of patients who kept an address on trial medicine , both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % and semi @-@ operate 73 % ) .
current values of scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ rates , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ in@@ dol .

in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole towards placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two Plac@@ ebo@@ x and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic kin@@ ks , revealed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a locking @-@ effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi@@ operating dol of week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also pointed out 12 a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia on like lithium or semi@@ tic .

with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in Phar@@ mo@@ cc@@ as@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ gic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
one @-@ specific evaluation of Phar@@ mo@@ cc@@ ine@@ tics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on Phar@@ mo@@ bra@@ z@@ ole of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ cular properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study near celebrities with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function to the Phar@@ mo@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .

the efficacy of my@@ u@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , on the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters earlier had previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ stic ( in all@@ a gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with the treated patients were treated , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pan@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time with metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pan@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who are silent or before the beginning of treatment low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils .
the approval of human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) found that my@@ x@@ ane in patients in which the first treatment was no longer fails , more effective than conventional packing lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicinal products has to be given by other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission of Er@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited issued a permit for marketing authorisation of my@@ u@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
my@@ stic mon@@ otherapy in patients is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine in @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ic &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ y during the abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced in subsequent series to 220 mg / m2 .
in sensory neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 the treatment is inter@@ rup@@ ting , until an improvement is reached to level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function were performed and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
my@@ u@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
my@@ stic an@@ x@@ ane is a nightmare of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately dra@@ fted and symptom@@ atic treatment is introduced , and the patient may not be treated with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
patients should not have any renewed my@@ stic treatment of treatment until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ s has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ ro@@ id number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sive .
while a ambiguous with my@@ stic cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardi@@ ac disease cases are not uncommon in the indigenous patient collective , particularly in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
if patients arise after the gift of my@@ stic nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ eme@@ al and con@@ pi@@ ous means .
my@@ stic an@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or pregnant women who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with my@@ stic , a reliable contrac@@ tion method .
male patients treated with my@@ x@@ ane will be an@@ gled , during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear witness .
male patients should be advised in front of the treatment about a sperm level , since the therapy with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect traffic and the ability to use machinery .
below are the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects associated with 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with my@@ stic patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in table 1 , the side effects are performed in connection with the gift of my@@ stic as mon@@ otherapy with each dose and indication in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ;

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection has been established with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ r@@ ub@@ ules ingredient that promotes the mer@@ isation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular cor@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through in@@ hibition of their land@@ oly@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bit of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the collective cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine transm@@ its into the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ine promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans @-@ mar@@ ital transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ ail@@ or recept@@ or and due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ bin@@ der Prot@@ eins ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) an pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of my@@ sq@@ ane for metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two one @-@ voice un@@ f@@ aded studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III study study .
in a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic Mam@@ car@@ cin@@ oma that were given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in the form of sol@@ uble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention to prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no medication . ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in addition to the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ els .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % because of met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients suffering at a time during therapy a peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 , evaluated .
the natural course of peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y for the ring on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative toxicity of my@@ x@@ ane to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ology of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of my@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was established in clinical studies .

the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or Wei@@ cht@@ eil@@ lan@@ tern from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ o@@ cular properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el have been compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ uble @-@ quality Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) , as after a sol@@ ub@@ medi@@ ated pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at my@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues , it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ aboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

the treatment with se@@ vers@@ atur@@ isation must be introduced under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the drug is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or its super@@ visor , provided that they have received an adequate guide .
in patients with chronic kidney failure , or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the housing values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per week in adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no Iron deficiency is composed , and fer@@ supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ yl or by giving the body not sufficiently to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought in , which it provides for the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene on a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study was projected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either applied to abor@@ tions , or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the variation of the hem@@ ost@@ asis values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin is inj@@ ected with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ cryp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ onal precision of patients received on abor@@ tions were uph@@ eld in the same extent as those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure that occasionally cause symptoms of endo@@ cr@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , steady , steady head@@ ache and con@@ fu@@ tile .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must@@ n &apos;t be applied to patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
waste as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that her@@ nia can be triggered by no allergic reactions .
the EP committee in the Human@@ it@@ arian Policy ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that such drugs was produced according to the provisions of the European Union , that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

after this recognition , through the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure could not be accelerated .
for tum@@ patient patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin can be considered ( patients who may have to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ B increase is larger than 2 g / d@@ l ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose needs to be adjusted according to paragraph 4.2 ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents - can hold the hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ worth between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ tin should be based on a benefit of risk considering joining the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are envis@@ aged for a larger el@@ ective orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention , should be investigated prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a major el@@ ective orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention , should receive an adequate Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic prophy@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of degenerative or vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in an underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it may not be excluded that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting bell jar of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post @-@ surgical / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , for epo@@ etine has not been proven to improve the overall survival for patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or to reduce the risk of tum@@ ours in progression .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .

survival and tumor trials were tested in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double b@@ linking plac@@ e@@ controlled trials and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin patients and the patient &apos;s patients .
in these studies the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia because of various more frequently Mal@@ ign@@ ancies consistent , statisti@@ cally significant greater mortality than with controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human being treated patients and in controls satisfac@@ tor@@ ily .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ istic er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are linked to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ar@@ thro@@ po@@ etic in tum@@ our patients with the aim of achieving a tick @-@ globe under 13 g / d@@ l , as too few patients were included with these characteristics in the revised data .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that performs the bones ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone break@@ outs ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic break@@ age as in the case ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of Kno@@ x , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ s should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after application of Ac@@ la@@ sta may reduce in the three days following the in@@ fusion of symptoms such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be used by doctors only by physicians who have experience in treating this disease .
as the ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was used for evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of ver@@ teb@@ rates and hips were examined over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , which had recently undergone a frac@@ ture ; it has been studied the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indic@@ ator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ orous ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme that reduces bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of gymn@@ as@@ tics were reduced in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients below the placebo at 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drug ) , the risk of hat@@ s were reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 by 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) against customs , or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , or any of the other components .
as with all the bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are protected at Ac@@ la@@ sta the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inj@@ ecting location and Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ers ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors who contains Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as how to apply the medicine , as well as the similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; April 2005 the European Commission issued the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for approval for the transfer of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended to a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , the administration of in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hips ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should ac@@ la@@ sta be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long emission period has been observed in patients following the therapy ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
additionally it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ eit@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initi@@ atory dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 by or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by applying Par@@ acet@@ amin@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney disease ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient benefit .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elimination among older patients , similar to younger .
children and young people in Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and juven@@ iles under the age of 18 , as data is missing for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are limited clinical experience for this patient population .
an existing hypo@@ the@@ an@@ emia is before the beginning of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron on the bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ cite , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ eit@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
additionally it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ eit@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer @-@ disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be wo@@ e@@ pl@@ ated before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate pre@@ fec@@ tive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental plu@@ gs , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the cran@@ ial area .
clinical evaluation by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by Gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
incidence of as severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation occurred in patients who received Ac@@ ship@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was comparable to 2.@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which is referred to as decrease of renal function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , associated with kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure , as well as a restricted kidney function , were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis for over three years between the Ac@@ sh@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed with 1.8 percent of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the lab scientists , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium @-@ values , which treated below the normal fluctu@@ ations ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ) .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the prevention of clinical questionn@@ aires after a frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study for the avoidance of clinical questionn@@ aires after a recent progression of vitamin D , the majority of patients were measured by an Initi@@ ald@@ osis vitamin D in front of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0,@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the cran@@ ial area was occasionally formulated mostly in cancer patients , about Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the oral region ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron , were treated .

an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a diminished Clear@@ ance from Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous substances are unlikely because customs acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans , and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible , material @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney disease down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance until 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the customs acid .
because serious kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) can only be restricted to data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxicity The highest in@@ effective intraven@@ ous dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs , individual doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on Au@@ c the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ aissance .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , by doses from 0,@@ 6 mg / kg than 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , ranging from intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , based on the Au@@ c , corresponds to the Au@@ c .
in long @-@ term studies with repeti@@ tive application in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions which exceed the maximum of intended Human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection .

Ris@@ ko @-@ Management Plan The holder of approval for the marketing authorisation is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities to pharmaceuticals , which are set out in the pharmac@@ ist version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human phar@@ ma , the revised R@@ MP will be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
an over@@ working R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is obtained , which could affect the current statements about safety , the pharmac@@ ist plan or activities to minimize the risk . • within 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ cul@@ ation or risk minim@@ ization ) could be reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ tive class , called the bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women who are employed for oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get &apos;s bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially estrogen , which are made from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , what makes the bone stock weaker than normal .
ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby guaranteeing a normal bone formation and thus l@@ ends the bones again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or having a dental surgery , notify your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff , if you have to take other medicines / apply or have recently been taken / used even if it is not a prescription drug .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether to take medications known from which they are the kidneys .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta , along with foods and drinks , you need to receive sufficient fluid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta will make two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip change .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions exactly to allow the calcium @-@ mirror in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can act Ac@@ la@@ sta for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration was missed by Ac@@ la@@ sta , you &apos;ll immediately get in touch with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta in case you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s doctor true and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects related to the first in@@ fusion occur very often on ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common following the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently , it is unclear whether ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received ac@@ la@@ sta .

please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff , if any of the side @-@ effects you have significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice adverse reactions that are not listed in this usage information .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C will not be over@@ stepped .
in patients with a pre @-@ proven low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture is recommended to make in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron on the bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ cal@@ cite , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ eit@@ sta .
additionally it is very advisable to ensure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice a daily amount of calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ eit@@ sta .
in patients with a recently @-@ low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , a starting dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 by or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

more than 7 000 patients were carried out , in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used in comparison to a placebo as a supportive instrument for setting up the smoking .
amongst the studies at the smoking setting , however , no uniform results showed , so that the effect of COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to assess in this application area .
which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? he found the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during the studies ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were found Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete listing of the effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects is the pack carrier .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The document is a summary of the European Public Relations Committee ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which it is explained how the studies carried out on the application for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It may be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic drug ) is not displayed .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who can not be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
combined with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl fuel ( low blood sugar ) can be maintained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl fuel or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better enhanced and the blood sugar levels drops better with type 2 diabetes .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ ate in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy has been studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ ers with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ ost@@ ine , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by applications of the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff showed up 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in at 2@@ 89 patients were examined , the patients , the Ac@@ tos , in addition to insulin , reported a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took in addition placebo .
the most common side @-@ effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( diminished sensitivity to maturity ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be applied in patients who may possibly act hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in people with liver problems , in@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ( high ket@@ one mirror - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos may serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for marketing action in the whole of the European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , dom@@ ed and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown in combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ ers is in@@ appropriate in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. premature heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and estrogen if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ pre @-@ advanced macro@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which resulted not to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased risk of liver liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper boundary of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one must not be used .
if the AL@@ T level increases to the 3 times the upper boundary of the standard range , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control once again .
in case a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vom@@ iting , torso @-@ coated , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker tier , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision whether the patient treatment is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ o , should be directed to the precau@@ tionary of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fats and is connected in some cases with a liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a her@@ edi@@ ction occurred under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a minor reduction of middle hem@@ ost@@ asis values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative @-@ controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis to 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis to 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitivity , it is possible to patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral or tri@@ pod combination therapy with insulin or as a branch combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch of the market launch , under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on an occurrence or a deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ ant with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the in@@ gestion of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ isons , but ha@@ unting doctors ought to be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ hedron , if patients are reporting about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events concerning bone armament from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 tri@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular disease , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 miles per 100 patient @-@ years ) were treated with patient @-@ medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs is the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies for the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on Pharmac@@ ology or pharmac@@ ist dynamics , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ una .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the Au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to triple the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the o@@ c of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which decreases in pregnancy , hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance , thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the Federal Growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not invaluable ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ ors and the re@@ inde@@ b@@ ulation of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents occurred over the tri@@ cycle of the standards of standards as below placebo , but less less than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency occurred at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 1,6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or her .
since the launch of the market , it rarely reported via con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure .
it was conducted a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events concerning bone armament , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with drugs treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with parti@@ ci@@ zing medication .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
while taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to function over an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) that leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could reduce the glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose testing in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time until the retro@@ fitting of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) can be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ e@@ ased study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were in@@ sufficiently adjusted , despite rot@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ cal optimization phase with insulin , was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continued to obtain insulin ; a reduction in insulin delivery in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .
in clinical studies a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ onal have been compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week research conducted on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction of ser@@ um tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic and of free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly enhanced L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years a reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plastic matrix gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while in met@@ form@@ ine and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide diminished values were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was reduced not only on the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the follow @-@ level tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this both via a effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the imaging of the Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
according to oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one gets absorbed quickly whereby the top con@@ centr@@ ations on un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
in this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness in about thre@@ e@@ fold the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in inter@@ activity studies it could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effect on Phar@@ mo@@ cc@@ as@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ eth@@ ic dynamics , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is at the human race 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma @-@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , although the instal@@ ments of the oral clearing of the mother are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeti@@ tive administration with ha@@ iry , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which decreases in the form of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the Federal Growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ted by the rat @-@ effects of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of the family @-@ aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ers lead to increased frequency of colon@@ ists .
the tablets are white until white , round , flat and wearing on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 tri@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular disease , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 miles per 100 patient @-@ years ) were treated with patient @-@ medication .
in a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were examined .
in clinical studies over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ onal have been compared to the output values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was reduced not only on the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also enhanced the post @-@ standard Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption , as well as to the hepati@@ c Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was mis@@ diagnosed with regards to its primary end@@ point , a combination of the tot@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium , leg @-@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary ro@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , put the results close that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one are not associated with cardiovascular risk .
the tablets are white until white , round , flat and wearing on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events concerning bone armament from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and received from over 7,@@ 400 patients who received compar@@ atively medication , showed an increased incidence of bone armament in women .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e has been studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as is not able to produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a withdrawal of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that pointed out that the blood sugar has been cut down similar to any other human being .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) to human being ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the package instructions ) .
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e prevail in the treatment of diabetes to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for authorisation for the transfer of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e throughout the European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day when a quick initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
inj@@ ecting needle must be hidden under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients , their blood sugar , for example , has improved significantly for instance by an intense insulin @-@ therapy , can be perceived the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning @-@ war@@ dness and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , kind of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin delivery ) , and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA for insulin in animal origin ) can cause a variation of the dosage required .
if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred according to a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less distinct or different from their previous insulin .
ahead of travel , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to solic@@ it the advice of his physician , as such tours may cause that insulin can be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients to be accepted by other drugs .
4 Bot@@ h hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia that can occur in one not sufficiently controlled di@@ abet@@ ta therapy , increase the risk of abnorm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics can lead to consci@@ ous@@ nesses and / or cla@@ ws , and with temporary or permanent interference of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system occasionally - peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neuro@@ path@@ y and usually rever@@ sible .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Un@@ low hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics can be treated by the oral inf@@ ant of glucose and sugar @-@ containing foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have sorrow , sweets , bis@@ cuits , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • sever@@ ity hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consciousness are treated with a in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.@@ 0 mg ) by a identified assistant or glucose , intraven@@ ously by the physician .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum max is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole length of time is up to 24 hours .
res@@ ection The Res@@ or@@ phic profile is due to the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a rapid or delayed reset .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ abol@@ ites formed by the split .
based on conventional studies for security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive Gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , to car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and for production of production , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular risks to humans .

acet@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id should be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may impact on blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for authorisation for marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide in the whole of the European Union .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already shown signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pl@@ under@@ scores ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater first @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
when the ur@@ inary per@@ sp@@ ar lies after two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per week , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , one can still occur during the first six months , which is therefore recommended that patients may use at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , or other medicines for preventing poison gas .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients participating , the efficacy was tri@@ pled in various aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with a placebo ( pseudo @-@ kam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol ( a other medicine used to treat hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ an@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract has been in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first trial had 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients , who took once daily 120 mg , during the last three measurements a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients below the case .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver .
especially in patients with heart symptoms in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the committee on human emergency treatment ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in conditions that have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ ations ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available gyp@@ h@@ j@@ al , and / or a poison apple ) .
if the ser@@ um so@@ ve sp@@ ells after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe renal function , effectiveness and safety have so far not been completely examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents do not give experiences in children and young people , the use of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ esses Sin@@ ce there are no experiences at Organ@@ izer recei@@ vers , the use of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compensation con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure is not recommended for treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ so@@ aring drugs , it can occur during treatment commen@@ ced to a acute toxicity , because by lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ag @-@ acid at first ur@@ inary re@@ abl@@ ations in the tissues can be mobili@@ zed .
B. with mal@@ ignant diseases and their treatment , read@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases happens so far that it comes to a dra@@ inage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed slight symptoms of liver @-@ in patients with feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore advised to perform at the beginning of the Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment and later on to clin@@ ically perform a liver failure ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ one was not conducted an exchange studies on Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is well known that X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ p can lead to a rise in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhibit@@ ation of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ shirts ) .

An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da There could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ id contains , the intake of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the Au@@ c .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ted pregn@@ ancies can not close due to side @-@ effects from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate to pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not allow directly or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be war@@ y with the taxes of a vehicle , use of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be somewhat safe , that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC would not affect its performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence is observed by the exam@@ in@@ ox study in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study of the Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term planning studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no k@@ aus@@ al relationship with feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate could be found .
the risk factors given by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ inf@@ o or an un@@ matched con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the health history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , resulting in treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate treatment groups a total of more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials , no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open @-@ term studies In the open long @-@ term studies studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those that were reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to occasionally on .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder , in which the bones are cre@@ amy ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ ting other medicinal products ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take place until after the first intake of the day which is to take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used by other medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data that originate from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE to enhance the effectiveness of vitamin D @-@ SLR .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients treated with low vitamin D mirror in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE , low ( 11 % ) than with those involved exclusively at aging ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data in front of the fact that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose is exactly the dose that is needed for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ alt ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , flat@@ ul@@ cers ( ul@@ ence ) , ul@@ cer ( pu@@ b@@ ular stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic de@@ cks .
in patients with et@@ wa@@ al hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE can not be applied .
it must not be used in diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand tall or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only associated with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or inser@@ ting medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following tips are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of obesity irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is to be swal@@ lowed up after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not di@@ gest the tablet or the tablet in the mouth since a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day that shall take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except pl@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can be given only under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of alleg@@ ation ( partial these severe and required a hosp@@ it@@ alisation ) .
the doctor is therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms , indicating possible bra@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be cau@@ tioned to prevent symptoms of symptoms such as Dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , pain in the gor@@ ges or retro@@ yst@@ erc@@ ing pains or new or self @-@ lim@@ mer@@ ing soy to put the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ onic side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it may point after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all faculty assignments are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large , clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was found , rarely ( according to market introduction ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regim@@ en predominantly intraven@@ ously cleared bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to give hints whether or not putting a tick @-@ surgical therapy in patients who need a or@@ tho@@ surgical procedure , which reduces the risk of a oste@@ onic card of the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor is decisive for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the patients should be instructed to take the tablet taken in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE to take the tablet next morning after they have noticed its om@@ is@@ ance .
you should not take two tablets in the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day .
other disorders which affect the mineral changes ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE from the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
alkal@@ inity foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ ection of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after in@@ gestion before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ activity studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical trials were taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or pregnant women .

fit out of two pl@@ az@@ ed controlled trials , which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily use of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was reduced by at least one new ver@@ teb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo ( 0 % ) .

according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the renal Clear@@ ance was over@@ hau@@ led by Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing volume exceeded 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not passed through the acid or alkal@@ ine convey@@ or system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems .

characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the share of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ath that is depos@@ ited in the bones , is quickly passed over urine .
although no clinical data is available about it , it is nonetheless likely to reck@@ on that the renal elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as well as in animal experim@@ entation is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .

as Tac@@ tics and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney failure , whereby the application of Ad@@ vaginal or Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients during which the transp@@ l@@ ant was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , a renewed organisation transp@@ l@@ ant or a resume of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been performed on 119 patients with kidney failure and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investig@@ ates how Ad@@ vaginal is included in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft by the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should identify this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , this can lead to transp@@ l@@ ant rep@@ u@@ ations or to an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ up@@ ings .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the tigh@@ ter control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic technique monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure to Tac@@ tics remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lica and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f you should control the Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus slow@@ ing in front of the conversion and over two weeks after the conversion .

careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ m Tal@@ king are recommended during the first two weeks after Tran@@ splan@@ tation under Ad@@ vaginal , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ l@@ ation phase .
since Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vaginal tin can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State achie@@ ves .
if the condition of the patient is permitted in the first post@@ operative phase any or@@ ale intake of drugs can be introduced by the Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .

further dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations can be later required since the phar@@ ma@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ tics in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation / Tran@@ splan@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily use in the morning .
dosage recommended - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal dosage by Pro@@ gra@@ f must be converted twice daily dosage by Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal intake , this shift in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the whole daily dose , to be done .
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant after switching from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants at Ad@@ vaginal bi@@ f once daily has to start treatment with the recommended dose @-@ transp@@ l@@ ant initi@@ atory dose for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation .

patients with reduced kidney function because kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ o@@ cular function of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of renal function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cancer level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inf@@ ancy and monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
switching of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vaginal , in case of switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations regarding the slow@@ down in the full ble@@ t The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in an individual case under state @-@ taking of whole blood @-@ level Tal@@ ro@@ li@@ mus controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus slow@@ down during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vaginal , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the simultaneous application of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m full blood@@ blood@@ stream ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vaginal is a drug with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the slow@@ ing level in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml is not exceed .
in clinical practice the head@@ level of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can generally result in liver transplan@@ ts in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and con@@ n@@ ated patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts , blood @-@ concentration were generally used in the range of 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transp@@ l@@ ur@@ rep@@ elling or other side @-@ effects , which can appear in a result of Tac@@ tics sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the tigh@@ ter control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .

at the prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tat@@ too of adult racing gra@@ ves and transplan@@ ts in childhood still no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ tic sm@@ al levels in the blood and a ton@@ ing of the clinical effect of Tac@@ o@@ li@@ m , the intake of herbal supplements , per@@ for@@ atum ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , is to avoid or other plant medicines during treatment with Ad@@ vaginal ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ tic concentrations in the blood are offered , as the Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , one was referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ y @-@ chamber or Sep@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which therefore can also occur in Ad@@ vaginal cav@@ ity .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation load and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ignant skin les@@ ions by suitable clothes or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who take the Tac@@ tics , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , changed consciousness of consciousness , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions , should a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as a inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus increase the blood levels of Tac@@ ir@@ li@@ m or decrease .
it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ tic blood levels can change in the simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ tics dose for maintaining simultaneous concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .
a pronounced interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka , such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic An@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ esters ( z ) .
Phar@@ mo@@ cular studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ tics , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , results .
high @-@ repor@@ tedly Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ prec@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used with acute @-@ rep@@ u@@ ction actions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ li@@ m in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m on the metabolism of other drugs called Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs that can be metabolic to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is imp@@ acted .
since Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus can slow down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase hormonal imbalance , in decisions regarding recep@@ tive actions can be particularly cautious .
the results of animal experim@@ entation have shown that Tac@@ lob@@ li@@ mus can decrease the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations in transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that under Tac@@ tics in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ant drugs , an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the newborn is recommended to possible damaging effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII whose innate blood @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ) is used .
the dosage and incidence of the use apply to whether Adv@@ ent is applied to the treatment of bleeding or to the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from one factor VIII lack , which causes hem@@ at@@ ting problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought in , which it provides for the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is approved by another in the European Union named Re@@ union , similar , however , is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical interventions .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ent was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ sep@@ tic with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; well . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate must not be applied to patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , Maus@@ or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued authorisation for B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved for the transfer of Adv@@ ent in the whole of the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy is directed after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ man@@ gels , according to the place and extent of blood pressure and the clinical state of the patient .
the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ga &apos;s events should not sink the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period under the specified plastic bars ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute draw@@ backs are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is prescribed for patients .
during treatment control , the dose of the dose and incidence of injections is to be proportionate to the factor VIII &apos;s rotation factor .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be cans between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high in@@ effici@@ encies , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be induced .
the appointment rate is aimed at finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be over@@ stepped .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ codi@@ fication activity of factor VIII orient@@ ated Ig@@ G Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .
developing the risk of inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereas the risk within the first 20 top days is the largest and on genetic and other factors .
in passing patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extru@@ days and am@@ nesty of well @-@ known inhibit@@ ory development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ act of ( lower tri@@ gen ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of the Hä@@ mop@@ hi@@ lie A in women lie on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against VIII ( 5 patients ) who all occurred in untreated patients who had a higher risk of forming in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not transfer@@ able ) .

the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cellular sources , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms shown on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .

based on the data from the available data on the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess its usefulness as positive , but considering that the security profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
hence the CH@@ MP is on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regulatory authorities should apply for another for 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed that the company particip@@ ates its application for approval for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and relies ) of it .
this is a type of virus that genetically modified so that an gene can wear to the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been transformed so that it can produce no copies of itself and thus trigger no infections in humans .
Adv@@ ant@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of not def@@ ective in the human body available p@@ 53 @-@ gene , usually contributes to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the basement , entered into the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked to him , still some questions were un@@ solved .
based on the documents submitted for initial documents , the CH@@ MP will receive 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP opinion not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has benefits for the patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not proven sufficiently that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company didn &apos;t inform the CH@@ MP whether the return consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ te Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ant@@ in .
&quot; modified active action &quot; means that the tablets are so squee@@ zed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly released via a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hypo@@ cris@@ y , by an allergy to pol@@ len @-@ controlled inflammation of the nose @-@ lanes ) in patients with nas@@ al @-@ skin swelling ( con@@ ges@@ ted nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and complete once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ loop ( du@@ op@@ ed nose ) , are deduc@@ ted .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can rel@@ ayed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main impacts were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever , reported by the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of all ha@@ y fever , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients received the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared to a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5,@@ 9 % in patients suffering from pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ loop was considered , the patients showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms at 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side @-@ effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ n@@ ness , harmon@@ ies , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( acts of loss ) , ob@@ struction , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may possibly become delicate ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine to treat allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased water pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) or having already had an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval for the transfer of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the whole of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without cas@@ ing them , to break or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data on in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible to keep and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the length of application to 10 days because in long @-@ term application , the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take place with time .
after decrease the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ skins in the upper air@@ ways , treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors respectively within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ dr@@ ine activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ur@@ oral , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to arrange appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations regarding dosage .
patients must be informed about the treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of p@@ pit@@ ations , heart @-@ rhythm problems , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be set .
in the treatment of following patient groups is advised to caution : • Pati@@ ents under dig@@ al patients • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ stick in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bl@@ ister@@ ium , or bron@@ chi@@ em@@ ason in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is available at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ologic tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce them .
in the context of clinical trials of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
this enzyme which has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not impe@@ de in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a beta @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
however , the in@@ ability of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of affected pregnancy outcomes , however , do not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities in comparison with the average population .
as reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c properties of Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be solved about that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of the traffic or the capability to use machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms can vary between a T@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , diminished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collision ) and a C@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ adm@@ ills , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als .
head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating ch@@ asing , muscle atro@@ phy and increased muscle tension , heart rhythms , thirst , thirst , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , nausea , dist@@ res@@ sing , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a C@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ li@@ ger@@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ gen@@ dered cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the eagle @-@ molecule P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard sizes of air performance , including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying .
controlled clinical trials were reported at the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can generate further like@@ able effects , such as raising your blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestation of a T@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines based on the overall cor@@ es for symptom ( except nose @-@ up swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of dropping effect , determined by the nose @-@ up swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin defined patient groups have no significant differences .
in the context of a single dose @-@ study on Phar@@ in@@ a@@ ze of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the fluid @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ o@@ cular multi@@ disciplinary study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , has been found that four celebr@@ atory des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly mistaken .
a component ac@@ tional study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) of Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin got from Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin according to the all@@ ine gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to a aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies for security sp@@ harm@@ ation , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for production of production , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data can be seen with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , no particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the effects of these effects were generally related to the pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine content .
in reproduction , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .
March 2007 and the 1.@@ 8.1 system of the authorisation application , it is established and works , before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to relie@@ ving the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body @-@ owned substance that can unfold its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relie@@ ve symptoms which occur in connection with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hypo@@ cris@@ y ) such as s@@ nee@@ zing , continuous or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and te@@ aring or ju@@ ck@@ wise eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the qu@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
there have been submitted further studies to prove that the body keeps the sy@@ rup , the solution to the inser@@ tion and melting pills in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average absorption of the symptom ( symptom score ) at 25 to 32 % , compared to the withdrawal from 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the withdrawal of symptom @-@ scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to those treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied in patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval for the marketing authorisation of A@@ eri@@ us in the whole of the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below paragraph 5.1 ) .
there are limited clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease and may be finished after the termination of symptoms and can be res@@ umed at their re@@ occur .
in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see below 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the inf@@ erior effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied at the current intake of co@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be solved about that in very rare cases , that it may occur in very rare cases , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of the traffic or the capability to use machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
the most commonly encountered side @-@ effects reported on the more common than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was increased at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ subject dosage , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine clinical dose ) were administered were not clin@@ ically relevant effects .
this includes both the inhi@@ bit of the release of pro@@ gen@@ dered cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhibit@@ ation of the expression of the eagle cells , P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
within the framework of a clinical study with multi@@ fac@@ t@@ ants , which is administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dosage ) was administered for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of air performance , including the ampli@@ fication subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as ni@@ aks , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , l@@ ur@@ ch@@ iness and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided in dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ istence allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall result of the questionnaire to the quality of life on Rhin@@ o @-@ Business vi@@ tis , ero@@ ides A@@ eri@@ us effectively the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria was re@@ acting as a substitute for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology has been studied irrespective of e@@ ti@@ ology at different forms and chron@@ ically recru@@ ited by chronic patients .
since the hist@@ amine is a primary factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular conditions , it is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as other forms of the ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of pre@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dosage inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not re@@ acted on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , excluded from the study .
an improvement in the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and of the wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a phar@@ ma @-@ study study , in which the patients were comparable with the general season allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no evidence for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however the enzyme for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a beta @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ is@@ let study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg resulted in meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) not on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies for security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive Gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity release the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in no particular risks to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ ca@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
the ag@@ grav@@ ating doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ag@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory studies should play a role .
around 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years are metabolic , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and learn a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ rate ( see below 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are limited metabolic , is identical to the ones in children that are normally metabolic .
this drug contains su@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take care of her@@ edi@@ tary problems such as fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose in@@ care or an sac@@ char@@ ase I@@ som@@ alt@@ astic in@@ suff@@ icing of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not found in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see below 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not enhanced with a@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the inf@@ erior effect of alcohol ( see below paragraph 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ens group like on the placebo group .
in clinical studies involving adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic ur@@ tics , reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ multip@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine clinical dose ) were administered were not clin@@ ically relevant effects .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because of the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be ordered in adults to the children &apos;s population .
within the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ multip@@ lier to adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dosage ) was applied over ten days with adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .

a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg led A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies at no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults it came from the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced sexual impair@@ ment or a increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as ni@@ aks , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , l@@ ur@@ ch@@ iness and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall result of the questionnaire to the quality of life on Rhin@@ o @-@ Business vi@@ tis , ero@@ ids e@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the cause caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s

the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ o@@ cular parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ cular multi @-@ disciplinary study with the sy@@ up@@ formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted .
the load ( Au@@ c ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours a bit higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no basis for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .
12 In various su@@ bi@@ osis studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max @-@ values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially approved by the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has rec@@ alled its application for approval for the application of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for protection against flu , caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect against a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic .
flu pan@@ demic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus , which can easily spread from man to humans , because human beings still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system is later able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently the ap@@ hr@@ ase of the virus was dis@@ infected with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a body un@@ familiar ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this led to the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ demic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical examination and need additional information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency illness of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is the Ac@@ quired Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , net@@ ase is indeed available as a solution for admission , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked which anti @-@ viral drugs have previously been taken , and the likelihood has judged that the virus will address the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases with in@@ gestion in combination with other anti@@ viral medicinal drugs and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS not to heal , however , can delay the damage of the immune system , and thus also the development of associated with AIDS infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ection@@ ists .
this reinforced with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r @-@ reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults who had formerly caught prot@@ ection@@ ist with other prot@@ ection@@ ists .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the modification of the virus last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ection@@ ism previously , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral burden below 400 copies / ml as below placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase was also the Vir@@ al last , however , of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ection@@ ists , very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults , who were previously treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ets , that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ generative ase the virus last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ection@@ ism :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ection@@ ist , it came under A@@ generative p together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last four weeks than with the patients who received their previous prot@@ ection@@ ism :
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ence ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and Fatima ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied to patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) against spec@@ ulations or any of the other components .
A@@ generative ase may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are just as well @-@ built and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ emia ( mis@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the committee on human emergency treatment ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ cular amplifier , but the committee found that the health of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not had a prot@@ ection@@ ist previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as for the time approval was limited only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group for approval for the transfer of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ generative ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ection@@ ist adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ o@@ cular t@@ anning of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of spec@@ Spec@@ viol@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral agent and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the inser@@ tion is by 14 % lower than from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ fores@@ ase capsules and solution for setting up on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base cannot be ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of spec@@ kled twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If an am@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ths ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of spec@@ ulations / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 m@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
Phar@@ mo@@ cc@@ as@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ection@@ ists were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ o@@ cular data , the dose should be reduced to as@@ re@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate @-@ severe liver therapy on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver disease with caution , in patients with severe liver disease , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generative ase must not be used simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
plant preparations , which include St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may be not applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure from HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ re@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ generative ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs should be applied ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy have an increased risk of severe liver disease impacts with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant section of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis @-@ active hepatitis also show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral hepatitis therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ one or other gluten co@@ stero@@ ids , which is not recommended via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless that the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic coron@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ ps and sup@@ compression the ad@@ renal function significantly ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the inter@@ change of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , becomes a simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin due to increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Organisation ) , are methods for determining the active ingredients .
for patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to decreased plasma @-@ hed@@ geho@@ gs of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with spec@@ Spec@@ viol@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ os symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ ca due to the high prop@@ ylene solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ection@@ ism , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , according to their therapy medications needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , like a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ mop@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ og@@ arthritis occur .
in HIV infected patients with heavy immun@@ isation therapy ( ART ) , it can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ up@@ iter , higher body measurements index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ generative ase must not be used simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeutic width of re@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with pharmaceuticals , whose agents are predominantly inter@@ linked via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plasma @-@ level with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure , and lead to resistance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the humili@@ ating plastic gel by a dosage increase of other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often have been observed undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already lon@@ ged St. John &apos;s wee@@ ds , the spec@@ kled mirror is and , if possible , checking the virus last and pos@@ ing the cur@@ vy .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when c@@ alle@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased to a maximum of 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with spec@@ kled capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of spec@@ Spec@@ s have been used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which occupy the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % humili@@ ated if am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) is administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ etra ( 400 mg / k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered twice daily .
a dos@@ ages recommended for the simultaneous administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra may not be given , however , a eng@@ masch@@ ige surveillance is recommended , since the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ cular study done for the use of a@@ gener@@ ics in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is advised due to the sac@@ zi@@ dis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and a@@ gener@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ectors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ection@@ ist and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in reduces the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is recommended as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic .
when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of spec@@ Spec@@ s and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin has led to a rise in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , with an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered together with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
Phar@@ mo@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the plastic bars of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the Au@@ c ( 0 % ) compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhi@@ bit or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can , if they are used together with a@@ fores@@ ase , possibly result in interactions .
patients should therefore be controlled to toxic reactions which are linked to these medicines if they are applied in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ection@@ ism , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as an ather@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ phic disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plastic bars of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium concentrations , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ lig@@ an , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ mon@@ pine , Ni@@ Ã pine pin , Ni@@ Ã pine pin , Ni@@ Ã &apos;@@ con@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by means of spec@@ kled , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake with a@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plasma concentration and enhance with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination of side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significant while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % serv@@ ank ( 90 % match frequency : 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these gluten co@@ stero@@ ids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment weighs at risk of systemic coron@@ ary effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose inter@@ change is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced spot@@ ting of the plastic de@@ pot at a current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
because plasma @-@ escal@@ ations of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ y can lead to m@@ yo@@ path@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , is not recommended by combining this medicine with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended a common monitoring of therapeu@@ tical concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirror since the plasma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be applied together with oral bi@@ ases ( see Section 4.3 ) while at the simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ ection@@ ers indicate a possible increase in the plastic bars of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ os symptoms , especially if they are given even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical calculations , there can currently be no recommendation as to adjust the spec@@ tor &apos;s dose when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with a@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a de@@ ton@@ ation or strengthening of anti @-@ oste@@ o@@ idal effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not required , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for current administration of a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful deliber@@ ation of possible usage for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk activated rats , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ spec@@ s are over@@ flowing with people into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of toler@@ ating r@@ att@@ as , which was administered by the inc@@ iner@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period of 12 body weight in the pro@@ gen@@ y .
the further development of pro@@ gen@@ y including Fer@@ til@@ isation and Re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the effects associated with the A@@ generative ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and rarely resulted in the treatment break .
many of these events have not been clarified , whether in connection with the A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug could be applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the listed side effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ oft did not identify patients 1200 mg A@@ generative p twice daily .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) considered by the investig@@ ator as related to the degree of study , and with more than 1 % of patients appeared , as well as under the treatment corresponding laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .

under 113 @-@ retro@@ viral not authorised individuals who had been treated with spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine on a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( legs ) has been observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .

cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ers were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , an advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective ( ART ) , it can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in each case patients , which received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and Labor@@ atories ( degree 2 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values which were reported among patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r , very often appeared .
in the case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary measures to initiate policies .

the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peri@@ pher@@ al blood cy@@ tes .
the 50 % per@@ m@@ entr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of spec@@ kled against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treat@@ able patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r do@@ si@@ ations were - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations rarely observed only rarely .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not subject to patients , the 700@@ mg of Fos@@ din@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ESS@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , came a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically evaluated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the ins@@ ure of 13 out of 14 children , with whom a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure inside the 59 included , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ets did not occur in patients , showed Res@@ cue patterns , which were similar to those in adults .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a heigh@@ tened phenomenal resistance with k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r and a decreased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is advised to continually pull up the current interpre@@ ting systems to the analysis of the results of pesti@@ cides .
on phen@@ otyp@@ ical Res@@ cue @-@ based analysis Clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to assess the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ection@@ ist isol@@ ates isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed sound@@ ing @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ des ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of a pesti@@ cides .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , c@@ im@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for the cross@@ resistance between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ esters for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r res@@ umes , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral failed patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , d@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ in@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 4 of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ection@@ ist drug resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
the early recovery of a wasted therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that may affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI passing adults according to vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ osi@@ dan@@ an@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ert , &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ e@@ one hundred thre@@ es ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ under@@ per@@ ple@@ xity of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ ad@@ ated average change of the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the virus @-@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ bi@@ ased a@@ fores@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , which were treated 152 with PI .
in the studies , a@@ gener@@ ase solution has been taken from 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients with PI @-@ negotiated patient had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ I .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml during a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ l to this data should be considered with the treatment optim@@ isation of one of the treatment approved by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ fores@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration is ( t@@ max ) to the maximum service concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 @-@ 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max it reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with spec@@ kled avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of the Au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resistance .
the apparent disp@@ osed of volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in plasma , being the amount of ser@@ ver@@ less am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ matched am@@ spec@@ s remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage part of the free active component during the automation inter@@ v@@ alls in the ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhibit@@ ing or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be given to caution when associated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the Gift of A@@ generative ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily spec@@ kled @-@ exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gram basis .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neglected , therefore , the impact of renal disease should be low on the elimination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r plasma statues , compared to healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg of spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ ul@@ arity with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats played in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ o@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome in doses , which weigh@@ ed 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily use of 1200 mg of spec@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ ocy@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma is not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present expe@@ ditions of the human being , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , there have been little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , micro@@ kernel @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes completed , was neither mut@@ t nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxicity can be observed and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates .
so far in clinical studies there has been no significant liver ingredient in patients , neither during administration of a@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality to the control as well as the animals treated with spec@@ ulations .
in a systemic plasma cl@@ ure , which was significant among ( rab@@ bits ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage by humans , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ths ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of spec@@ ulations / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 m@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be done in patients with s@@ watch@@ ful or mild liver disease with caution , in patients with severe liver disease , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standards Organisation ) , are methods for determining the active ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced in duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure , and lead to resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased to a maximum of 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with spec@@ kled capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ etra ( 400 mg / k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered twice daily .
a dos@@ ages recommended for the simultaneous administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra may not be given , however , a eng@@ masch@@ ige surveillance is recommended , since the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with spec@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ectors would be low .
when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of spec@@ Spec@@ s and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered together with a@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is 31 at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium concentrations , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ lig@@ an , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ mon@@ pine , Ni@@ Ã pine pin , Ni@@ Ã pine pin , Ni@@ Ã sti@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by spec@@ kled avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in the k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significant while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % serv@@ ank ( 90 % match frequency : 82 to 89 % ) .
at the simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with a@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a de@@ ton@@ ation or strengthening of anti @-@ oste@@ o@@ idal effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ eth@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to an ab@@ duction of the Au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful deliber@@ ation of possible usage for the mother compared to possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of toler@@ ating r@@ att@@ as , which was administered by the inc@@ iner@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period of a diminished increase in the body weight .
the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in the case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary measures to initiate policies .
the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood cy@@ tes .
the 50 % per@@ m@@ ity ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ection@@ ist drug resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation of PI @-@ related children the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ fores@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of in@@ less am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates of the percentage part of the free active component during the application intervals in ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhibit@@ ing or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be given to caution when associated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
also the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neglected ; therefore , the impact of renal disease should be low on the elimination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ ul@@ arity with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats played in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ o@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome in doses , who reported 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people twice daily use of 1200 mg of spec@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ chi@@ al aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma is not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical use , however , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test , micro@@ kernel @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , g@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ine@@ ers nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality to the control as well as the animals treated with spec@@ ulations .
these results make it clear that in juven@@ iles the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , making am@@ spec@@ s or other critical parts of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ generative ase solution for installation is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ection@@ ist adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generative ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generative ase solution for rede@@ em@@ ing was neither associated with PI patient patients nor with PI @-@ patient patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the inser@@ tion is by 14 % lower than from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ fores@@ ase capsules and solution for setting up on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base cannot be ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to deposit ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for a gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be over@@ stepped ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dos@@ is@@ recommen@@ ding to be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to unic@@ ating and low @-@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for necessary , an application of a@@ fores@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l is a@@ fores@@ ase solution for inclusion in infants and children under 4 years , for pregnant women , in people with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ or of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure from HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ re@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 to transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standards Organisation ) , methods are available for determining the active ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced in duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical , 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ mop@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ og@@ arthritis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure , and lead to resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased to a maximum of 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with spec@@ kled capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered .
simultaneous intake with a@@ fores@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentration and supply with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination of side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
on the basis of data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are significantly higher than Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am significantly higher concentration of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk to the human being is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the contained prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l does not apply during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk activated rats , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ spec@@ s are over@@ flowing with people into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble study of toler@@ ating r@@ att@@ as , which was administered by the inc@@ iner@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , demonstrated during the lac@@ tation period of 55 body weight in the pro@@ gen@@ y .
the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clarified , whether in connection with the A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug could be applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treat@@ able patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r do@@ si@@ ations were - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations rarely observed only rarely .
the early depar@@ ting of a wasted 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that may affect the following treatment .
62 basics based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation of PI @-@ related children to the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; a@@ fores@@ ase .
the apparent disp@@ osed of volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be ruled on the blood circulation of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .

Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cells ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is contra@@ indicated for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with warran@@ ted diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing this , every 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no prec@@ lu@@ zation scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no prec@@ lu@@ zation scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fu@@ eled reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should be monitored much tigh@@ tly and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in a reasonable stage setting , in the re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected to form nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in handling the treatment for a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment has been cautious .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion using medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ Py@@ re@@ tika ) to minim@@ ise the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or medium @-@ sized in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred will be res@@ umed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow directly or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , who were exp@@ on@@ ated against the lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase across the mother &apos;s milk , is advised to do not satisfy the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
adverse reactions in clinical studies were reported mainly as in@@ fusion reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable drug interactions observed in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older during a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ associated involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history also occurred severe reactions , including Bron@@ zes , respiratory and facial skin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children of undes@@ irable drugs relating to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study involving 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe form @-@ form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously each week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
with most patients it occurred within 3 months after the commen@@ ced treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , where patients at the age of 5 with more severe form of age occurred during a month ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients no more ectable by radio immun@@ o@@ sten@@ si@@ vity ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies before , including 3 patients , in which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing up to low antibody levels exp@@ elled a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres was a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in Phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ al to low neutrality inhibit@@ or effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to interfere with clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug actions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of an additional accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and cells into the ly@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ers @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ orous recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ ased phase 3 @-@ trial of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which exp@@ elled the entire disease range , was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient dis@@ missed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label evaluation study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group enhancing the lung function and the salary , which is shown in the table below .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks to the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of time and the absolute volume of lung lob@@ ina increased proportion@@ ately to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant increase in the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) has been fixed , which remained constant due to the degree of study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease cases between patients suffering from the combination of a combined end point , clinical trials in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , movement area of the shoulder bag , AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ o@@ genetics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients , which at the time of their intake were under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy rel@@ ational form and 4 with the middle sections ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and every 4 patients with the mid @-@ range form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ range form has been shown a normal mental stage speed , whereas in older patients with severe form @-@ form were limited only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 trial , research on pharmac@@ o@@ il@@ m@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ zation schem@@ ata were performed at the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously each week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the Do@@ zation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients suffering from the difficulties with a weekly basis ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equivalent to intraven@@ ously .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ gic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to older patients suffering from older and less severe patients .
based on conventional studies for security sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , toxicity in unique gift , toxicity in repeti@@ tive administration and reproduction , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data can &apos;t detect any particular risks to humans .
since no compatibility studies were conducted , this medicine cannot be mixed with other drugs except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a other medicine against cancer ) in patients suffering from cancer ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( mal@@ ignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to deterior@@ ate slightly to other parts of the body . • Advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attacks the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously had not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ en as the sole treatment is applied .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should prior to or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ eme@@ al &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to avoid a fluid lack of damage ) .
in patients whose bleeding changes or where certain other side @-@ effects occur , the treatment should be pulled up , set or reduce the dose .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form occurs easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of cancer cells .
in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta has been studied in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in one study to 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived by 12.@@ 1 month , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients were not reported in the case of cancer epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , at the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival than with the comparison of comparison .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transfer of A@@ lim@@ ta to the whole of the European Union .
each iter@@ acy must be solved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the R@@ ole bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % So@@ dium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in a second @-@ line treatment for patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ cellular bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( COM ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours , about 30 minutes after completing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
for the reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of Hau@@ tre@@ ach , the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid were given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the whole treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need a in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third party action cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before every gift created a full blood picture - the , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and the thy@@ ro@@ id counting .
the Al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage test must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ ing of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood bil@@ low or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the prior therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients according to 2 dos@@ ages , an hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological Tox@@ ic@@ ity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues in the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years old , or in comparison to patients aged 65 , there is an increased rate of risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dosage adap@@ tations necessary to go beyond the recommended dosage recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function@@ all@@ isation of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border tri@@ via and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ ic of &gt; The 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limits ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ x mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute Neut@@ ro@@ v number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ gens and has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for other cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute Neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ics , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ derness and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ugly tox@@ iz@@ ations , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lesser toxicity and a reduction of the level 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non@@ woven tox@@ iz@@ ations such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ o- , when a pre @-@ treatment had taken place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 .
therefore all patients need to be instructed to use the patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction of appropriate toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid in@@ simultaneous intake non @-@ stero@@ idal Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ less T@@ ens 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is provided , must take the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ expect@@ ant time for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with em@@ bos@@ ses ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events occurred , they had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid waste collection in the trans@@ cellular room a dra@@ inage of the ergometer can be weigh@@ ed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ ine , and cerebral vas@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this drug has usually been administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application @-@ gentle li@@ mp@@ s ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of a irreversible fle@@ ction of the reproductive capacity through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed consists , men should be advised in front of the treatment - should be advised to obtain advice on sperm level .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can result from non@@ stero@@ idal Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased de@@ em@@ xed tri@@ tion using the result of a multip@@ lication of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ tion@@ t@@ yl@@ cop@@ ic acid can be used in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ less T@@ ens 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time experience like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ om@@ oxi@@ di@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ inn@@ ess status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient , the pati@@ os with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but like an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ est@@ ol@@ ites are expected to occur in pregnancy heavy birth defects during an application in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely veri@@ fiable and after careful deliber@@ ation of consumption for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since the possibility of irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity has been mixed by em@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised of the treatment course , consultation with regard to the block@@ ade .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed goes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om and random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Er@@ - occurred as well as 163 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , random@@ ized c@@ is@@ plat@@ inum as mon@@ otherapy .

patients who take care of All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ists .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they may not disman@@ tle some fats in the food , thus causing a quarter of the fats caused by the food to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took about 60 mg after one year , having average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .
in the study of All@@ i with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for the patients .

it must not be applied in patients who are treated with cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ of transplan@@ ative patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syn@@ onym ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in Chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver illness ) , and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers .

alli is contra@@ indicated in weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body Mass @-@ index BMI 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ ched diet .
alli may not be applied to children and juven@@ iles under the age of 18 , as there is not enough data on effectiveness and safety .
however since the listing is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , in getting older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of dosage is necessary .

the probability of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken together with a high @-@ fat meal or low @-@ fat meal .
since the weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli a physician or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who have as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should ask their physician or pharmac@@ ist issues whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional wa@@ vering measures to prevent that in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions between medicines and in several cases with the current use of the Or@@ be@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ plasma @-@ bars was observed .
with the use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with a list , the Quick @-@ values ( international rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients , treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with the list , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ enes in norm@@ ality remained .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a complement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamins ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of the organ are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal diseases and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with a list of 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not transfer@@ able ) .
the frequency of known side effects found after the launch of the list is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli may lead to supplements in regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
individual doses of 800 mg of Or@@ be@@ at and multi @-@ multip@@ lier of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to norm@@ al@@ ge@@ able and overweight people without any significant clinical findings .
in the majority of the cases reported on the market launch , either side effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported at the recommended dose of a list .
based on research on humans and animals , it can be assumed by a fast back @-@ formation system , which are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ zed properties of the organ .

clinical studies have been derived , that 60 mg of Or@@ be@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ e@@ controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ be@@ at that was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ ched diet .
the primary parameters , the change in weight versus the initial value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as percentage of those studies , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurs in the first six months .
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with a list of 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied at chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of al@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ eme@@ al medication ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as it does not provide enough information to the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance uses a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies to 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemical therapies received , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , during the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 by 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , showed 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 15@@ 3 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in one comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for alo@@ on ( 119 from 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued the War@@ rior Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the transfer of alo@@ es by Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is contra@@ indicated : to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ xi to the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids prior to chemotherapy .
da Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is able to extend the col@@ on sli@@ ces , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute ic@@ le@@ us after injection mol@@ ested .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in the simultaneous approval of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron with drugs called the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be of such an extender .
except in connection with another chemical therapist , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used neither in preventing chemotherapy nor to treat nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ otic AG does not impe@@ de tum@@ ors of the five investigated chemical therapies , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , a significant pharmac@@ o@@ idal interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ osis and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ or concentration of a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors showed itself .
in a pharmaceutical @-@ based pharmac@@ ist analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ tin , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , me@@ et@@ dine , par@@ ini@@ dine , mar@@ qu@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron at human pregn@@ ancies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was not used in pregnant women , unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary .
clinical studies were the most common ones observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observing side @-@ effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the appointment ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of unwanted events showed themselves as well as in other types of automation ; there were no dose @-@ drug relations to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the large volume of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for a alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were received a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received an anti @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7 hours ) , given in day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , received in day 1 intraven@@ ously .
studies of atively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on comparable .
according to the findings pre @-@ clinical investigations Pal@@ on@@ otic tron has the ability to block the ion &apos;s v@@ entri@@ cular function and pol@@ arized channels and leng@@ then the duration of the action potential .
the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. given in@@ cle@@ ment Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in su@@ sten@@ osis of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ ignation After intraven@@ ous Gift follows a long @-@ term elimination of the plasma centr@@ alised elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ological half time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire doses area of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average size ( ± SD ) increases by day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ otic tron Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
the pharmac@@ o@@ cular sim@@ ulations emerged that at once daily intraven@@ ous form of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which according to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous value was comparable ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0,@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys , and about another 50 % are transformed into two primary materials , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron was an un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a time @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt at healthy , the total body was between 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while in patients with severe liver disease , the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron increases , a reduction in the dose is thus not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron is only able to block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular determin@@ ants and re@@ pol@@ arization and can prolong the shareholders exercise .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( every dose has been given up in about 30@@ ti@@ fold the therapeutic exposure to men ) which were daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pancre@@ as , ad@@ renal glands and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is designed for unique applications , the relevance of these results will be small compared to humans .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of approval for the drug is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C via Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ector .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should resem@@ ble an effective component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Re@@ ference Tool &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( one caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue damage caused damage , moreover , the values of the liver en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are significantly increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stim@@ ulates this to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data containing the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredients , composition and purity of the drug , active ingredient , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy approval of Alp@@ he@@ on is compared to the efficacy approval of the reference practitioner to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured , as many patients following 12 of total 48 treatments , as well as 6 months after hiring the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient .
the number of patients with H@@ CV , which spoke to treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after hiring the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease was again found again in more patients than with the terms of reference ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side @-@ effects .
aside from that , the study was evaluated in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins , against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ acking infection ) and small infected crops ( cr@@ acking or cutting ) , ch@@ opped off and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against these kinds of infections might not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not talking about the treatment two to three days , the doctor should again investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ashed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo on the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ per@@ ges , Al@@ tar@@ go and cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact : if the results of both studies were taken together at home performance , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , found that Al@@ tar@@ go is found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( time @-@ filled hollow habitats in the body tissues ) or infections that were to be verified or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation to the order .
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go could ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections regarding the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small la@@ in@@ ations , ch@@ ord@@ ances or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for approval for the transfer of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients , during which two to three days are no improvement , should be investigated once and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of raising or serious local irritation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the sal@@ vi@@ be carefully wiped out and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection will be started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin does not apply to the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA as path@@ ogen is known or suspected ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies involving secondary wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ yl @-@ res@@ istent Pen@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) in@@ sufficiently .
an alternative therapy is expected to be considered , when after a 2 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deterioration of the infected point occurs .
the impact of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which have been reached in humans according to topical skin or infected superf@@ ici@@ ally wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant hem@@ ic@@ ality in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous Gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be on de@@ ported skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be considered , if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a prec@@ inc@@ tive ox@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the Federal Statisti@@ cal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be should be used only during pregnancy , if a top@@ ographic anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to be preferred to the gift of a systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / finished / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go can be continued / termin@@ ated is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies conducted in 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied was the most frequently reported side effect ir@@ ation of the administration site which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
work@@ around Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , characterized by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ ery ) isolated .
the re@@ mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin depends on the selective inhibit@@ or of bacterial prot@@ yn@@ thesis by inter@@ acting in a certain link@@ age of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the relationships of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ gra@@ ding anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bond @-@ hole of the Bosnian Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ links and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ actic centre .
by attachment to this link@@ age , the P@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line supports the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ ind@@ ings , block partially P @-@ bonds interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local prevalence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be harmless at least some infection @-@ forms , a consultation by experts should be pursued .
there were no differences in In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ults were delicate or resistant to meth@@ icillin .
in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
trans@@ cription In a study involving healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ine was launched daily by oc@@ clu@@ sion into intact and ported skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plastics were obtained .
the sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 for adult patients , both before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ig@@ saw skin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .

in studies for oral toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect Hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases related to the liver ) in children between the ages of 1 and 15 who are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
ambient rix is applied within one of two doses of existing vaccines , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that from two doses can be led to an existing vaccination plan .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another H@@ CV or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vaccines have effects by promoting the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as opposed to a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
ambient rix contains the same ingredients as the Twin@@ rix adults have been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix kids will meet within the framework of one of three doses of the vaccines .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations in a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections .
ambient rix led at between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient pressure was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the injections .
the most common side @-@ effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain on injection , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to active substances , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transfer from ambient rix to the whole
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation Plan for Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines or with a combination of bin@@ ational vaccines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface anti @-@ hepatitis type ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination by the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccines .
it is not yet fully secured , such as immun@@ ological individuals who have addressed on a CV @-@ A@@ - vaccination should need a refres@@ her as protection , as it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for all injection mol@@ ding substances , you should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the Stand@@ ardi@@ al scheme is recommended with the combination simp@@ bin@@ ed , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ antes hepatitis B surface .
in cases of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis and individuals with disorders of the immune system , under certain circumstances , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies is achieved , so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the glut@@ in@@ ism to a sub@@ optimal result , these injections should be avoided .
in Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ ia or blood @-@ operation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ ject in@@ tim@@ ately sub@@ cut@@ aneous since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix is administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular poli@@ om@@ yel@@ in@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined Mas@@ - m@@ umps @-@ vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective needs , that may not be sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 vaccines this wording in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , matri@@ mon@@ ality , Gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable with the incidence observed in former Thi@@ omer@@ al@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccines .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been given in a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of 3 @-@ doses period .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis per ino@@ cul@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on one calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix with 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the test according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses period simp@@ lier .
after the complete vacc@@ fec@@ ycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects received , Ambi@@ rix had to be administered about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.6 % in the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage com@@ bos .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vaccine li@@ fec@@ ycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects that were ambi@@ ente , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination . ) .
the frequency weigh@@ ted pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was small and comparable that was observed after administration of the Com@@ bin@@ ation@@ ist vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the appearance of local reactions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was observed with administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination @-@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g @-@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ s , however , after vaccination with ambient rix a common appearance of pain ( at the injection ) a dose , not per proxy , reports .

in clinical studies conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ um conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ um conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study done at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old they received 142 two doses ambient rix and 147 the standard combination material with three doses .
at the 2@@ 89 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was inter@@ changeable , the Ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ Service@@ fried ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with ambient light in the month 2 and 6 .
the immune response revealed in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after ending the full vaccination series ( i.e. in the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations have either been a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ contin@@ ous hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for people who were at the time of pri@@ mers between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambi@@ ance in 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccines .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that which was based on vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combination , consisting of 360 ELISA units formal hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dose @-@ volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the pers@@ ist@@ ency of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies is comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccines .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as by bathing in waste water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ ending face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect from an infection with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 dos@@ ages .
if you have already infected / your child before the administration of both vaccines already infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child can not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease infection .
protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a H@@ CV or Hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• if you have an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ cking skin r@@ ashes , breathing difficulty or swelling of the face or the tongue . • If in your child has occurred at least once a allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• if you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( that is , within 6 months and prior to the arrangement of the second vaccination dose ) .
if there is a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis @-@ A@@ - / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content in effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection from end to the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to people suffering from severe bleeding disorders that are inj@@ ected under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child sub@@ tract a tick .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals may not be sufficient , so a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 See your doctor , if you / your child take another medicine ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibody ) have been given / or is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambient light , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different links as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be administered apart from there is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs to 50 without pins .
based on the data that has been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the transport system , the CH@@ MP opinion that the value @-@ risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix not only have been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to small patient collection .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be def@@ ective in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ consistent endom@@ etri@@ al or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy ( brain injury as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ium con@@ centr@@ ations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - split by several individual pants to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach blan@@ ket in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose to the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseudo @-@ medication , that is , without any substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps also can cause loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , helpl@@ ess , fluid or taste , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , in@@ convenient body odor or weight gain .
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ ine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract can be effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because of the condition of the disease to be limited only limited to this medicine at the time of authorisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indic@@ ative in all patients in which a complete en@@ closure lack already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ feste form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which manifes@@ ts after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or be available for patients with gor@@ ges . AM@@ MONA@@ PS also is available in Gran@@ ular form .
daily dose is calculated individually with regard to the protein tolerance and the necessary daily intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste deficiency of Car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine app@@ ucc@@ in@@ atal deficiency ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with gor@@ o@@ dys@@ functions , as there is a risk to the emergence of o@@ sop@@ ho@@ gan@@ a , when the tablets are not immediately flowing into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore only be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ tention and estrogen @-@ going clinical conditions only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ath is carried out via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure should only be applied with extreme care .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a heigh@@ tened loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left at the human &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ esthe@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ osis , heavy hypo@@ the@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose came with a 5 month old small baby with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic connection that is secre@@ ted by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is secre@@ ted across the kidneys .
st@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine and urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prognosis of the early mani@@ feste form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age has been almost always cast , and the disease itself led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking free an@@ alogue to death during the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative paths of nitrogen compound ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , sodium gra@@ vi@@ at and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new @-@ born with post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed disease to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ feste form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the excess was 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in treating and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed into phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is neg@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and his Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ tes and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous form of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a or@@ alen dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gestion were measured by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ cli@@ c disorders or hem@@ ost@@ asis , according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the following morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting no Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which have been treated with sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations declined in the plasma cycle on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is secre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ ic glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not have to swal@@ low a tablets , or patients suffering from dro@@ opy ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nose @-@ son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the standard range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste deficiency of Car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ s were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ esthe@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ osis , heavy hypo@@ the@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
after a oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after in@@ gestion were measured by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
during the duration of durability , the patient may retain the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
this course contains the small spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can accumulate the sti@@ cky waste products that are accum@@ ulating after consumption of proteins in the body .
if conducted with you laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium poly@@ yl D@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription drug .
during the lac@@ tation period you are allowed to take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the medicine could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases also con@@ fu@@ sions , headaches , flavors , re@@ discovery of o@@ bedience , cra@@ y@@ ability , remin@@ ders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ ically states were observed .
when you find one of these symptoms in you , you immediately contact your doctor or with the reception of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for instance by inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ ard@@ stick ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PC@@ I will meet a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in people with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac attacks to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PC@@ I .
nearly 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , with the effect of angi@@ ox on all@@ a gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ots ) using he@@ et@@ in ( a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PC@@ I , the patient is often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the as@@ antry to prevent a loss ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ ze@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart cases or vas@@ cul@@ arization operations ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients , subjected to a PC@@ I , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective regarding all indicators as effective as yeast in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than yeast .
angi@@ o@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may possibly become sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other stags or one of the other components .
it may also not be applied to patients who have recently had a bleeding , as well as people with heavy hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection .
the committee on human emergency treatment ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that an@@ ox on the treatment of ACS and during a PC@@ I is an acceptable replacement for he@@ et@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the Company of The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a permit for the transfer of angi@@ om@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ile anxiety disorder ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ ald@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox on patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,@@ 1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PC@@ I was carried out in other episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PC@@ I can be applied according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt from 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage from an@@ gi@@ ox for patients with a PC@@ I consists of an initi@@ al intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PC@@ I procedure is scheduled .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , this should be properly mixed and dil@@ uted medicines in front of the application carefully and the bol@@ d@@ osis quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney functionality , ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PC@@ I ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is administered by 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and once again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney injury , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PC@@ I study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In people with severe renal damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ om@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous production of sub@@ cut@@ ted sl@@ ings or 8 hours after ending the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low molecular yeast .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other entity or against bra@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irreversible bacterial En@@ do@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe renal damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PC@@ I @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most bleeding occur in arter@@ ial point infection , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ aneous anti @-@ surgical interventions ( PC@@ I ) during the treatment generally occur anywhere .
in patients , taking the war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Standards Organisation ) should be considered to ensure the value of dra@@ fting the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ in din once again reached the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ stad@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these agents are raising the danger of blood .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ orial aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameter in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embryonic co@@ fo@@ al development , un@@ equi@@ pping or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either in@@ frac@@ tion@@ able yeast or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in the compar@@ es @-@ treated compar@@ es , it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding have been defined by the AC@@ U@@ ITY and T@@ IM@@ I units for heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ et@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dated plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ tive or surgical intervention required , hem@@ at@@ b@@ ular bleeding or blood pressure in the p@@ ation point , the reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ ar of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood @-@ point , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less often observed blood loc@@ alis@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ b , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who undergo a PC@@ I .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in the compar@@ es @-@ treated compar@@ es , it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less often than in the comparative group of He@@ et@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
following adverse reactions , which are not listed above , have been reported as comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs .
in the case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately disman@@ tled and the patient eng@@ masch@@ ige with regard to signs of a bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ binary inhibit@@ or that bin@@ ds both on the cataly@@ tic centre and the anim@@ on@@ en@@ bind@@ ings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or on straight line .
the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is spl@@ its off the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus reducing the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Ser@@ um of patients , in which it came in the past too hetero@@ sexual cy@@ top@@ mal Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ lic Ag@@ gregation reaction induced .

if a PC@@ I was carried out in the patients a PC@@ I was given an additional bolt from 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was given un@@ questionable s@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ aning attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or either before the start of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or at PC@@ I .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk of high risk factors , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread ev@@ enly over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent of Isch@@ ia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiovascular biom@@ ar@@ ker , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients throughout 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is applied to the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the waiter @-@ poor inj@@ ected or administered as inf@@ in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the blood pressure ( sugar ) in the blood or may not process insulin .
insulin is very neg@@ li@@ gible , and the change means that it has a faster effect and has a shorter activity time than a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ lasting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes in which the body of insulin can not be effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated her@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adult type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human standard .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components , or in patients suffering already in hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of ap@@ id@@ ra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission shared San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH approval for the transfer of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the whole of the European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , either in the area of the stomach @-@ blan@@ ket , the th@@ ru@@ th@@ mus or the del@@ usion or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal wall .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ gen@@ esis capacity and reduction of insulin , the insulin need to be low in patients with a restriction of liver function .
any change of activity , the trademark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , or delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin delivery ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin .
3 An inadequate dosage or the demo@@ li@@ tion of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ ant diabetes , may cause hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or a insulin delivery should take place under strict medical supervision and may make a modification of the dosage required .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in changing the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances that can increase the blood sugar blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting , fibro@@ sis , pent@@ oxi@@ di@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ s , S@@ ali@@ cy@@ l@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics .

animal experimental studies on reproduction of reproduction showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ist in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic co@@ fo@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin enters into human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin takes place in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consciousness can be treated by in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or treated by the intraven@@ ous form of glucose by a doctor .
after a gl@@ is@@ ag@@ onal infection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the cause of the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose levels ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be insulin , the effect takes place faster and the active time is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , the insulin range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportionate , glucose resistance , and at 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a low proportion of glucose levels , just like humanity .
insulin is growing at almost twice as fast as normal human@@ ism and generates the complete draft car@@ ving effect about 2 hours earlier than humanity .
from the data it was evident that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal ur@@ ging , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
Insul@@ in@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was done , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was achieved than with human@@ istic standard , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal commen@@ ced , a compar@@ ably gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal attachment , which is given 2 Mi@@ xed before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
