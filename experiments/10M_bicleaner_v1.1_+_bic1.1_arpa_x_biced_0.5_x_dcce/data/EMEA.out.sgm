<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Relations Committee (EPAR), which explains how the research committee has been analysed, in order to make recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your illness or treatment, please read the packages (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Sres thought and talk, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), mistrust and inscription; • bipolar disorder, an mental illness, in which the patient manic episodes (periods anomalness) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify is used for treating moderate to severe manic episodes and to the prevention of severe episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">With both diseases, the solution can take place for inserting or melting off in patients requiring the gorges of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are just as bilify, should be adapted the dose of bilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances, which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably acts as a "partial agist" for the receptors to the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiinzol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters appears to enable the receptors to activate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and its reoccur will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of bilify, the reappear of symptoms to prevent, has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection therapies was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased restlessness, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was built over twelve weeks at 347 patients with semi-operate, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to occur to 160 patients in which manic symptoms were already stabilised by bilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of bilify injection injection was approved in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which was made in increased unrest, with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients with a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbed the melting pot and the solution to the absorption.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection resolution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify has decreased in four of the five short-time studies some more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, Abilify prevented further up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the reoccur management episodes from previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses diminished also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extraterrestrial disorders (infestation), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (obstruction), vomiting, nausea (infobstruction), fatigue and fatigue, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The health committee on human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify during the treatment of schizophrenia and severe to severe manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole spoke to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the board came to the result that the benefits of injection resolution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transfer of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A heightened effectiveness at dosages about a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiatory dose should be considered, if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">When the CYP3A4 inductor is derived from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of successive behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after switching to an antipsychotic therapy, also with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of sufficiency compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well known cardio diseases (myocarardine or ischaemia diseases, conditions prescribed for hypotony predispose (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-lowering medications) or hypertension (including acute and malignant shape).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of treatment with Aripiprazzol emerging Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dynesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that pointed to a mn, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotic drugs, including ABILIFY must be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole comes to patients with claws in the anamnesis or at states which are to be used with caution in crashes.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a raised mortality compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study involving fix dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the contact for unwanted sponaneous events treated with Aripiprazole-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoaziosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related undesirable events associated with ABILIFY and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus were regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotic drugs, in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole to the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with its overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, an gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorness rate of Aripiprazole, whereby this effect is not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine), the Auc of Aripiprazole is 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to be other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisians, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration by Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extenze.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors, the potential benefits should prevail over the patients "potential risks.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly efficient Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-protectioners, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After completion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors the Dosage should be raised by ABILIFY on the Dosage at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole a day have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethadan / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethadan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should get advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or getting pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data security in humans and due to the concerns resulting in the process studies in the animal, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify clearly the potential risk to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, even with other antipsychotic drugs, patients should be warned of before dangerous machines, including fuel vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole does not have any negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than on placebo or were regarded as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks, with patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total of less incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathony and Dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with semi-operated idol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">A placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% for patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23,5% in patients under arithmetic treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-operating idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term preparation phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18,2% for patients suffering from Aripions-treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely performed laboratory parameters, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Undermining of the CPK (creatine-phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side-effects which can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and on their occurrence also in treating with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, Spätlirovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional assault rifles were observed with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with valued doses of up to 1260 mg and without any fatalities.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information on the effectiveness of an overdose with Aripiprazole comes before; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma operation.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder about the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazzol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrengen and to histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed a dose-dependent reduction in the bond of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo a statistically significant stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In an active dol-controlled trial in week 52 of the share of patients who kept an address on trial medicine, both groups similar (Aripiprazzol 77% and semi-operate 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressrates, showed a significant stronger improvement than at Halindol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of residue rate caused by 34% in the Aripiprazole-group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olani-controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients embraced and included in the primary study approach, with significantly less patients gain weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole a compared to placebo superior efficiency in reducing Lyme disease symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole towards placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placebox and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic kinks, revealed Aripiprazole a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a locking-effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semioperating dol of week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also pointed out 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of mania on like lithium or semitic.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which spoke partly over 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy with therapeutical symptoms in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expandability over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached an remission during a stabilisation phase before marginal symptoms, the Aripiprazol showed up with regard to the prevention of a bipolar tube, primarily in preventing a relapse to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 have been responsible for stretching and hydration by Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkydy is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle Eliminationshalbwerage is approximate 75 hours for Aripiprazole in intensive metabolism over CYP2D6 and at almost 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripiprazole there are no differences in Pharmoccastics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacogic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">One-specific evaluation of Pharmoccinetics found no indication of clinically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on Pharmobrazole of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacocular properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study near celebrities with various liver cirrhosis (child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function to the Pharmoprazole and dehydro Aripiprazole but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for security spharmacology, toxicity in repetitive administration, reproducioxicity, genotoxicity and the canopic potential let the preclinical data realize no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological morphological effects were observed only in doses or expositions which significantly exceeds the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>

<seg id="97">In addition, a choleliorasis was found as a result of the sulphate of sulphate conjugate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3fold the middle steady state exposure (Auc) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times of the recommended maximum dose with human being based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the within the human gin performed at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the gin of apes, and lie far below the marginal (6%) of the vitro solubility.</seg>

<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection has been established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrubules ingredient that promotes the merisation of microtubules from the tubular corules and stabilizes the microtubules through inhibition of their landolyzation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibit of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the mikrotubulary network that is essential for the vitale interphase and the collective cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumine transmits into the Transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the frame of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of Albumine promotes the transport of Paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved trans-marital transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albailor receptor and due to the albuminbinder Proteins (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) an paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>

<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced tumors, pharmacocular properties of Paclitaxel have been compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 soluble-quality Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%), as after a solubmediated paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at myxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissues, it is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 myxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer with less than 1% of the given dose, 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or its supervisor, provided that they have received an adequate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure, or in patients who receive chemotherapy, the housing values should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per week in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no Iron deficiency is composed, and fersupplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, an anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietinyl or by giving the body not sufficiently to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells, thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell, in which a gene (DNA) was brought in, which it provides for the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration as an injection in a Vene on a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was projected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either applied to abortions, or continue Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the variation of the hemostasis values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin is injected with those of Eprex / Ercrypo at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemostonal precision of patients received on abortions were upheld in the same extent as those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who continued Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side-effect of Abseamed is a rise of blood pressure that occasionally cause symptoms of endocropathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steady, steady headache and confutile.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed mustn't be applied to patients who may possibly become sensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="386">Harmonic symptoms and follicences may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease-last; hence the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease prevention is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haembody by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients can occasionally be observed in a patient individual hemostonal precision via or under the hemostasis system.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given these hemoghaired stability should be tried by an appropriate dosage management, the hemostal-in-level concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the Hämobell is more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemostropvalue 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) exceeds 25%, the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be tightly monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is in the lowest possible dose which is necessary for the control of anaemia and anaesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initial low HB value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) possibly need higher heating users as patients in which the initial anaemia is less heavy (HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="417">The Hämoglobinansen should be approximately 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidently coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure should be passed by Section 4.2 recommended allimit of hemostal-in-percentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">After this recognition, through the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which is not yet dialysis, the progression of kidney failure could not be accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumpatient patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-gift and erythropotin can be considered (patients who may have to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the HB increase is larger than 2 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l) per month or a HB value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose needs to be adjusted according to paragraph 4.2 (see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic agents - can hold the hemostropworth between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application recombinant Erythropotin should be based on a benefit of risk considering joining the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic intervention, should be investigated prior to the beginning of the epoetin-alfa-therapy the cause of anaemia and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a major elective orthopaedic intervention, should receive an adequate Thrombogenic prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of degenerative or vascular diseases, particularly in an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it may not be excluded that in treating epoetin alfa for patients with a starting bell jar of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post-surgical / vascular events can exist.</seg>

<seg id="428">Once epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin controlled and the Ciclosporindosis should be adjusted to the rising hematology.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro-vitro studies, there are no evidence of interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotanical, vascular events like myocarbons, myocarcous attacks, arterial thyrombosis, arterial thyrombosis, arterial thyrombosis, arterial thyrombosis, arterial thyrockets and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under the erythroetic treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa, reported.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side-effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment with Erythropoetinen.</seg>

<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of Knox Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light-heavy Morbus Paget of Knox (average Serum-mirror of alkaline phosphate ase corresponding to 2,6times up to 3,0times switch-specific upper level with recording in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of customs acid in comparison to ingestion of 30 mg Risedronat once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results after 6 months a similar decrease of pain strength and pain modification has been observed compared to the output value for aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were infected at the end of six month's main study as Responsible (response to the therapy) could be included in an observatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedron-treated patients who received on the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach could be maintained with 141 of the patients treated with acronage, compared to 71 of the aftermath of 18 months following the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Once-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of customs acid at 64 patients, the following pharmacocular data, which proved to be dosisindependently.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma sawells took off at &lt; 10% of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the top value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphastical disappearance of the large cycle with half-periods t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ ß 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with an terminalen elimination period of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned ½ - values) probably represent the rapid resignation in the bones and excretion on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours you can find 39 ± 16% of the given dose in urine, while the rest is basically tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall body-clearing is independent from the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains uninfluenced by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledron-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance from Cytochrom-P450-Enzymous substances are unlikely because customs acid is not metabolized by humans, and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special care groups (see Section 4.2) The renaissance of the customs clearance with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinin Clearance, and amounted to 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and moderate kidney disease down to a creatinin Clearance until 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the customs acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because serious kidney disorder (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) can only be restricted to data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest ineffective intravenous dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, individual doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on Auc the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application has been administered in 3-day intervals, by doses from 0,6 mg / kg than 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, ranging from intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of human therapeutic exposure, based on the Auc, corresponds to the Auc.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repetitive application in cumulative expositions which exceed the maximum of intended Human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the Gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The commonest treatment in studies with repeated application was a multiplicity of spongiosa in the metaphysical mass of animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a fund that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats, one observed a teratogenicity at doses from 0,2 mg / kg than outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed although the maternal toxicity in 0.1 mg / kg was marked as a result of a reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The document is a summary of the European Public Relations Committee (EPAR) in which it is explained how the studies carried out on the application for human therapeutic agents (CHMP), in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It may be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (in particular overweight patients), in which metformin (a diabetic drug) is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) who can not be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">Combined with a sulphylharnstoff or insulin, the previous dose of sulphyl fuel (low blood sugar) can be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulphyl fuel or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better enhanced and the blood sugar levels drops better with type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acetate in tripleotherapy has been studied; in addition, patients received a combination of metformers with a sulphylharnstoff, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycosylified hemostine, HbA1c), which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by applications of the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion study the effect of the additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylharnstoff showed up 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin in at 289 patients were examined, the patients, the Actos, in addition to insulin, reported a lowering of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took in addition placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects related to Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (diminished sensitivity to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be applied in patients who may possibly act hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in people with liver problems, ingestive heart failure or diabetic cetoaziosis (high ketone mirror - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos may serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients in which metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued the Company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for marketing action in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, domed and wear on one side the marker "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown in combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformers is inappropriate in due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The use of pioglitazone for patients under 18 years of age are not available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. premature heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and estrogen if Pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-pre-advanced macrorovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which resulted not to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased risk of liver liver (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper boundary of the normal range) or with other signs of liver illness, pioglitazone must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT level increases to the 3 times the upper boundary of the standard range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control once again.</seg>
<seg id="773">In case a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unresolved nausea, vomiting, torso-coated, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker tier, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient treatment is continued with Pioglitazo, should be directed to the precautionary of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fats and is connected in some cases with a liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a herediction occurred under the therapy with pioglitazone a minor reduction of middle hemostasis values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative-controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemostasis to 3-4%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulphylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of hemostasis to 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity, it is possible to patients, the pioglitazone as oral or tripod combination therapy with insulin or as a branch combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market launch, under the treatment of Thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazon, was reported on an occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic maculant with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the ingestion of pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaisons, but haunting doctors ought to be aware of the possibility of a maculahedron, if patients are reporting about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events concerning bone armament from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 trictures per 100 patient-years with patients treated with pioglitazone to women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular disease, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 factions per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 miles per 100 patient-years) were treated with patient-medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs is the treatment (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on Pharmacology or pharmacist dynamics, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA reductuna.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with fibrosis (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the Auc of Pioglitazone to triple the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a lowering of the oc of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone which decreases in pregnancy, hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance, thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the Federal Growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgors and the reindebulation of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT ascents occurred over the tricycle of the standards of standards as below placebo, but less less than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrorovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency occurred at Pioglitazone to 1,6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone or her.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of the market, it rarely reported via congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more frequently if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events concerning bone armament, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with drugs treated with pioglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with particizing medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">While taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to function over an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxicome Proliferator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)) that leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone could reduce the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose testing in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with pioglitazone versus Gliclacidal as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time until the retrofitting of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) can be maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placeased study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were insufficiently adjusted, despite rotimonatical optimization phase with insulin, was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the middle HbA1c reduced by 0.45%, compared to patients who continued to obtain insulin; a reduction in insulin delivery in the group treated with pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies a year under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotional have been compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week research conducted on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction of serum triglycemic and of free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, however clinically not significantly enhanced LDL cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years a reduced pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide the total plastic matrix glycemeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazone was not found a statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while in metformine and gliclacide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazone was reduced not only on the sober triglyceride, but also improved the follow-level triglyceride levels, this both via a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the imaging of the Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease in groups which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application Pioglitazone gets absorbed quickly whereby the top concentrations on unchanging pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">In this basis the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness in about threefold the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interactivity studies it could be proven that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effect on Pharmoccastics or pharmacoethic dynamics, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with fibrous (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the waste (55%) and a lesser extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging pioglitazone is at the human race 5-6 hours, and the total active Metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma-centrations of Pioglitazone and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, although the instalments of the oral clearing of the mother are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repetitive administration with hairy, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone which decreases in the form of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the Federal Growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were inducted by the rat-effects of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazers lead to increased frequency of colonists.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and wearing on one side the marker "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 trictures per 100 patient-years with patients treated with pioglitazone to women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular disease, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 factions per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 miles per 100 patient-years) were treated with patient-medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with pioglitazone or Gliclacide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotional have been compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was reduced not only on the sober triglyceride, but also enhanced the post-standard Triglyceride absorption, as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was misdiagnosed with regards to its primary endpoint, a combination of the totality, non-fatal myocardium, leg-amputation above the ankle, coronary rovascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, put the results close that with the intake of pioglitazone are not associated with cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and wearing on one side the marker "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events concerning bone armament from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with pioglitazone and received from over 7,400 patients who received comparatively medication, showed an increased incidence of bone armament in women.</seg>

<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was at 22% (60 of 268) of the patients under Allopurple inol and none of the 134 patients below the case.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (nausea), skin rash and abnormal liver.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart symptoms in prehistory there may also be an increased risk of certain side-effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The committee on human emergency treatment (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the urinary tract in the blood as Allopurple inol, but also a higher risk of side-effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperurikemia in conditions that have already led to Uratablagations (including one out of the medical history known or currently available gyphjal, and / or a poison apple).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum sove spells after 2-4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µl / l), can be considered a dosage increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe renal function, effectiveness and safety have so far not been completely examined (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents do not give experiences in children and young people, the use of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplanesses Since there are no experiences at Organizer receivers, the use of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease patients with ischaemic cardiac disease or decompensation congestive heart failure is not recommended for treatment with Febuxostat (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnsoaring drugs, it can occur during treatment commenced to a acute toxicity, because by lowering the Serumharnag-acid at first urinary reablations in the tissues can be mobilized.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. with malignant diseases and their treatment, readch- Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in urine in rare cases happens so far that it comes to a drainage in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed slight symptoms of liver-in patients with febuxostate patients (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore advised to perform at the beginning of the Febuxostats treatment and later on to clinically perform a liver failure (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylone was not conducted an exchange studies on Febuxostat, but it is well known that XO-Hemp can lead to a rise in the theophylline (a inhibitation of the metabolism of theophyline was also reported for other XO-shirts).</seg>
<seg id="1191">At Probanden, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and Naproxen (250 mg 2 x daily with a rise in Febuxostature (Cmax 28%, Auc 41% and T1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2-shirts was not related to a clinically significant increase of unwanted events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without having a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or at the same time required other active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study of celebrities 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily an average 22% increase in the Auc of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitor effect from Febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida There could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a antacid, the magnesium hydroxid and aluminium hydroxid contains, the intake of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease of the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the Auc.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exponted pregnancies can not close due to side-effects from Febuxostate to pregnancy or the health of fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow directly or indirect impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be wary with the taxes of a vehicle, use of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be somewhat safe, that ADENURIC would not affect its performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence is observed by the examinox study in the Pivotal study of the Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term planning studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no kausal relationship with febuxostate could be found.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors given by these patients were an arteriosklerotic disorder and / or a myocarardinfo or an unmatched congestive heart failure in the health history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), resulting in treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostate treatment groups a total of more than once were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Colchicin. * * In the clinical trials, no severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open-term studies In the open long-term studies studies have been treated 906 patients up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during long-term studies were similar to those that were reported in the studies of phase 3 (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events have been reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-time extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to occasionally on.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events have been reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypanaesthesia, pericia, incineration, skin dermal loss, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure, erectile dysfunction, increase in potassium concentration in the blood, decrease of the lymphocyte count, decline of the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The mechanism of uric acid is in the human being the final product of the Purinmetabolism and is in the context of the repercussions hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a powerful, not Purine-selective Inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIXO) with a Ki value for the in vitro inhibiting that lies beneath the nanomolar area.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and fact study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperurikemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary vortex-point was in every study the proportion of patients during which the last three months of a particular serum sow sandpit &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µl / l) were.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 10), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum cancer worth of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Allopurple inol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The fact-study showed the statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Allopurple inol 300 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum cancers &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were compiled for analyses. * p &lt; 0,001 versus Allopurple inol, # p &lt; 0,001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum pernag on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µl / l) was observed in the physician during the medical visit in week 2 and permanently maintain throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurple inol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum cancers &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney functionality. the APEX study evaluated the effectiveness at 40 patients with kidney functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary focal point at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in terms of the percentage of serum-acid repercentrations in agents, irrespective of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in a group with severe kidney problems).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with Serumharnmilch repercentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl approximately 40% of patients (APP) and fact-study together had been a Serumharnsour reconcentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected during two years of the open extension study of phase 3 revealed that the permanent lowering of the serum sow saws to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µl / l) revealed that less than 3% of patients needed in the months 16-24 a treatment against a glove (i.e. more than 97% of the patients required no treatment against a plaster).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of the gyphal size, which at 54% of patients had a complete disappearing of plunderscores up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were received in patients who received a long term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also received in patients who received Allopurple inol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers the maximum Plasmakonzentrations (Cmax) and the area under the Plasmakonzentration period (Auc) from Febuxostat after administration is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For cans between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Febuxostat an increase in Auc that is greater than the dosisdisproportionate increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After ingestion simpler or multi-plaster doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5,3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage of serum-acid reconcentration, provided that this has been tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The seeming Steady state distribution volume (VSS / F) from Febuxostat is in the range of 29 to 75 l according to ingestion of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plastic concentration of febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary bond to Albumine) and is consistent over the concentration wide that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg, constant.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro-studies with human liver microsomnia showed that these oxidative metabolites are primarily formed by CYP1A1, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxograph gluonid is mainly created by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After ingesting a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostate found approximately 49% of the dose in urine as an unchanging Febuxostat (3%), acyldraught (30%), whose known oxidative metabolism and its conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">Besides the excretion of urine, approximately 45% of the dose was found as unaltered Febuxostat (12%), Acyldraukuronid of the ingredient (1%), whose known oxidative metabolism and its conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special care groups. insufficiency after intaking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat does not change in relation to probes with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total Auc from Febuxostat was about the 1.8-fold from 7.5 μ g / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g / h / ml in a group with severe renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 liver functionally, after taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh classification A) or moderate-severe (child-Pugh classification B), the Cmax and Auc from Febuxostat and its metabolites changed not significantly compared to probes with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There have been no significant changes in regard to the Auc from Febuxostat or its Metabolites for taking multi-plinous doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenese, impairment of Fertilisation With male rats has been a statistically significant increase of urinary infloratory receptors (transitional cell papillomas and carcinoma) only in connection with Xanthin stones used in the highly-treated group, with approximately the 11-fold of exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a special-specific form-metabolic and urinisation and for clinical use as not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, that were around 4.3- times of human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity joined, which was associated with a lowering of the suspension and a development delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in mastering rats with expositions, the approximately the 4.3 times and in traded rabbits with expositions, which wore approximately the 13-time of the human therapeutic exposure, has no teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid a irritation of esophagus, the patient may take place until after the first intake of the day which is to take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used by other medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data that originate from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE to enhance the effectiveness of vitamin D-SLR.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the proportion of patients treated with low vitamin D mirror in the patients treated with ADROVANCE, low (11%) than with those involved exclusively at aging (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also put data in front of the fact that in ADROVANCE contained in ADROVANCE, alendronate dose is exactly the dose that is needed for the prevention of a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side-effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal healt (diarrhoea), constipation, diarrhoea (flatulence), flatulcers (ulence), ulcer (pubular stomach) as well as acidic decks.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with etwaal hypersensitivity (allergy), vitamin D3 or one of the other components the ADROVANCE can not be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following tips are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of obesity irritation and related side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE is to be swallowed up after the day only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not digest the tablet or the tablet in the mouth since a risk for oropharyngeal ulzera. • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day that shall take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gastrointestinal tract, except plyloroplasty, can be given only under special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Ösophageal reactions, such as Ösophagitis, ösophageal ulzera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by ösophageal strips, were reported in patients under the intake of allegation (partial these severe and required a hospitalisation).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor is therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms, indicating possible braophageal reactions, and patients should be cautioned to prevent symptoms of symptoms such as Dysphagie, pain in the gorges or retroystercing pains or new or self-limmering soy to put the medicine and obtain medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malonic side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it may point after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a malhageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all faculty assignments are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large, clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was found, rarely (according to market introduction) stomach and duodenalulzera, including some severe severe and with complications, reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonekrose of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including Osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen predominantly intravenously cleared bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to give hints whether or not putting a tick-surgical therapy in patients who need a orthosurgical procedure, which reduces the risk of a osteonic card of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical evaluation by the prescribing doctor is decisive for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">The patients should be instructed to take the tablet taken in the next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE to take the tablet next morning after they have noticed its omisance.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets in the same day, but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the planned weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other disorders which affect the mineral changes (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism), should also be treated with ADROVANCE from the beginning of therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alkalinity foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplement, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resection of alendronage if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after ingestion before they take other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interactivity studies were not conducted, Alendronat in clinical trials were taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines, without having clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronat does not let any indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic cofoal or post-natal development recognize.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonekrose of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bisphosphonates; most of the reports were reported by cancer patients, but also reported on osteoporosis.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data from the available data on the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to assess its usefulness as positive, but considering that the security profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Hence the CHMP is on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the regulatory authorities should apply for another for 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that genetically modified so that an gene can wear to the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus" that has been transformed so that it can produce no copies of itself and thus trigger no infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advantin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made of not defective in the human body available p53-gene, usually contributes to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study with a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni-cancer in the area of the basement, entered into the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked to him, still some questions were unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the documents submitted for initial documents, the CHMP will receive 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP opinion not sufficiently proved that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore has benefits for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not proven sufficiently that Advantin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hypocrisy, by an allergy to pollen-controlled inflammation of the nose-lanes) in patients with nasal-skin swelling (congested nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and complete once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-loop (duoped nose), are deducted.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can relayed to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main impacts were the changes in the severity of the hay fever, reported by the patient before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of all hay fever, except the constipation of the nose, the patients received the aerinaze, compared to a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35,9% in patients suffering from pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-loop was considered, the patients showed a alleviation of symptoms at 37.4% compared to 26,7% in patients who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side-effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycarnness, harmonies, psychomotor hyperactivity (acts of loss), obstruction, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), insomnia (sleepiness), sleeping disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may be used in patients who may possibly become delicate (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine to treat allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (increased water pressure), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension) or having already had an hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued an approval for the transfer of aerinaze in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without casing them, to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be applied due to the lack of data on inconsistency and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) not in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible to keep and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the length of application to 10 days because in long-term application, the activity of pseudoephedrine can take place with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease the swelling of the mucosskins in the upper airways, treatment can be continued when needed with desloratadine as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrin, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors respectively within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimedrine activity in combination of pseudoephedrine, pergolid, luroral, Dihydroergotamin, phenylephrine, ephedrin, oxymetacolin, nhazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collective, and the data are not sufficient to arrange appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations regarding dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or a tachycardia or of ppitations, heart-rhythm problems, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of headaches) must be set.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups is advised to caution: • Patients under digal patients • patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocarardstick in the Anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, blisterium, or bronchiemason in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is available at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatologic tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce them.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials of desloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor testing there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This enzyme which has not yet been identified for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine does not impede in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a beta-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">However, the inability of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancy outcomes, however, do not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison with the average population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstric properties of Pseudoephedrin aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1690">In a single dose-study with adults, Desloratadine showed no influence on standard sizes of air performance, including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">Controlled clinical trials were reported at the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day no increased frequency of strokes in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can generate further likeable effects, such as raising your blood pressure, a tachykarst or manifestation of a TNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determines based on the overall cores for symptom (except nose-up swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets in terms of dropping effect, determined by the nose-up swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin defined patient groups have no significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose-study on Pharinaze of aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the fluid-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. is officially approved by the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) that the company has recalled its application for approval for the application of Aflunov to the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people for protection against flu, caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect against a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus, which can easily spread from man to humans, because human beings still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as" "" "body foreign" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently the aphrase of the virus was disinfected with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a body unfamiliar), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This led to the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical examination and need additional information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with human immunodeficiency illness of type 1 (HIV-1) which is the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, netase is indeed available as a solution for admission, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the security of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked which anti-viral drugs have previously been taken, and the likelihood has judged that the virus will address the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg kaviavir and with other antiviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases with ingestion in combination with other antiviral medicinal drugs and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to heal, however, can delay the damage of the immune system, and thus also the development of associated with AIDS infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, who previously had not been treated with protectionists.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This reinforced with low dosified kavir-reinforced drug Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who had formerly caught protectionist with other protectionists.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood (virus last) or the modification of the virus last after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protectionism previously, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral burden below 400 copies / ml as below placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase was also the Viral last, however, of the children who had previously been treated with protectionists, very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, who were previously treated with Proteasets, that with Ritonavir increased drug Agenerative ase the virus last after 16-week treatment as effective as other protectionism:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protectionist, it came under Agenerative p together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the virus last four weeks than with the patients who received their previous protectionism:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side-effects of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Flatulence (flatence), vomiting, skin rash and Fatima (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be applied to patients who may possibly become sensitive (allergic) against speculations or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerative ase may also not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are just as well-built and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take agenerase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), a Osteonekemia (misdie of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The committee on human emergency treatment (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacocular amplifier, but the committee found that the health of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not had a protectionist previously.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as for the time approval was limited only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group for approval for the transfer of Agenerase in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerative ase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protectionist adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenerase capsules are to be given to pharmacocular tanning of amspecavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of specSpecviolr should take place in consideration of the individual viral agent and the pre-treatment of the patient (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amspecavir as a solution to the insertion is by 14% lower than from Amspecavir as a capsule; therefore, aforesase capsules and solution for setting up on a milligram per milligram base cannot be exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of speckled twice daily along with 100 mg kaviavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If an amase capsules can be applied without the amplifying additive of Ritonavir (booths), higher doses must be applied to agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of speculations / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mspecavir that should not be exceeded (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmoccastics, efficacy and safety of agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protectionists were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on inconsistency and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacocular data, the dose should be reduced to asrease capsules in adult patients with moderate-severe liver therapy on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions on 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver disease with caution, in patients with severe liver disease, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerative ase must not be used simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Plant preparations, which include St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be not applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amspecavir during the intake of amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure from HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunist infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asrease does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerative ase capsules along with low doses of kaviavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs should be applied (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral hepatitis therapy have an increased risk of severe liver disease impacts with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant section of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis-active hepatitis also show increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral hepatitis therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticone or other gluten costeroids, which is not recommended via CYP3A4, is not recommended, unless that the possible benefit of a treatment is the risk of systemic coronticosteroids including Morbus Cusps and supcompression the adrenal function significantly (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the interchange of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, becomes a simultaneous administration of agenerase with lovastatin and simvastatin due to increased risk of myopathia including Rhabdomyolysis not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Organisation), are methods for determining the active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who are taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective due to decreased plasma-hedgehogs of amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amspecavir may be the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with specSpecviolr, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentos symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycoca due to the high propylene solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protectionism, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, according to their therapy medications needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, like a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hamophiles patients (type A and B) that were treated with proteasms, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematology and hemogarthritis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV infected patients with heavy immunisation therapy (ART), it can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is adopted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosupiter, higher body measurements index), cases of osteonekrose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutical width Agenerative ase must not be used simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with lower therapeutic width of regenerase with Ritonavir may not be used together with pharmaceuticals, whose agents are predominantly interlinked via CYP2D6 and are linked to the increased plasma-level with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin a 82% reduction in the Auc of Amspecavir, which can lead to virological failure, and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the humiliating plastic gel by a dosage increase of other Protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often have been observed undesirable effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The Serummirror of Amspecavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already longed St. John's weeds, the speckled mirror is and, if possible, checking the virus last and posing the curvy.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when calleavir is administered together with amspecavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased to a maximum of 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with speckled capsules (600 mg twice daily) is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of specSpecs have been used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily which occupy the effectiveness and harmlessness of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliated if amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kaviavir twice daily) is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amspecavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination of amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg / kavir + 100 mg kaviavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg kaviavir twice daily is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosages recommended for the simultaneous administration of amspecavir and Kaletra may not be given, however, a engmaschige surveillance is recommended, since the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacocular study done for the use of agenerics in combination with Didanosine, but is advised due to the saczidis component of Didanosine that the revenues of Didanosine and agenerase lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore in the gift of Efavirenz in combination with specSpecavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with specSpecavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protectors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protectionist and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin reduces the serum concentration of amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is recommended as delavirdin might be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plastic.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be made, as an exact prediction of the effect of combination of specSpecs and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amspecavir and rifabutin has led to a rise in the Plasmakonzentration (Auc) by rifabutin by 193%, with an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin can be administered together with agenerase, a reduction in the dosage by Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmookinetic studies with agenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, however, the plastic bars of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamavir and 100 mg kaviavir with 200 mg ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the Auc (0%) compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamspecavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibit or inductors of CYP3A4, can, if they are used together with aforesase, possibly result in interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be controlled to toxic reactions which are linked to these medicines if they are applied in combination with agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protectionism, it is advisable that Antazida may not be taken at the same time as an atherase as it can come to resorphic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amspecavir can lead to a humiliation of the plastic bars of amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium concentrations, such as Amlodiligan, Diltiazem, Felodimonpine, NiÃ pine pin, NiÃ pine pin, NiÃ'conpine and Verapamil can be increased by means of speckled, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with agenerase can increase its plasma concentration and enhance with PDE5 inhibitors in combination of side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the kaviavir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to Probanden have been significant while the endogenous cortisol rose by approximately 86% servank (90% match frequency: 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous Gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended with these gluten costeroids, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment weighs at risk of systemic coronary effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin and simvastatin, whose interchange is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced spotting of the plastic depot at a current administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma-escalations of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy can lead to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, is not recommended by combining this medicine with amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutical concentrations to stabilizing the mirror since the plasma concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by amspecavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase is not allowed to be applied together with oral biases (see Section 4.3) while at the simultaneous use of agenerase with parenteral midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protectioners indicate a possible increase in the plastic bars of Midazolam around the 3- to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with specSpecavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentos symptoms, especially if they are given even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical calculations, there can currently be no recommendation as to adjust the spector's dose when Amspecavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the simultaneous use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with agenerase, an increased control of INR (International normative ratio) is recommended for the possibility of a detonation or strengthening of anti-osteoidal effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not required, therefore also alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for current administration of agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful deliberation of possible usage for the mother compared to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk activated rats, amspecavir-related substances have been proven, however, it is not known whether amspecs are overflowing with people into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproducible study of tolerating rattas, which was administered by the incineration in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, demonstrated during the lactation period of 12 body weight in the progeny.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of progeny including Fertilisation and Reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amspecavir to the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The inconceivable of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and older in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the effects associated with the Agenerative ase treatment were slightly up to moderate, occurred early and rarely resulted in the treatment break.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified, whether in connection with the Agenerase or another drug could be applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the listed side effects stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with Proteasoft did not identify patients 1200 mg Agenerative p twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4) considered by the investigator as related to the degree of study, and with more than 1% of patients appeared, as well as under the treatment corresponding laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy has been associated with an redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV-patients, including a loss of peripherals and fast subskin tissues, increased intraabdominals and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocrine fat collection (pin baking).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113-retroviral not authorised individuals who had been treated with specSpecavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine on a medium duration of 36 weeks, only one case (legs) has been observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study of PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTI- in comparison to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTL over a average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were normally easy to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itchiness and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week, and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to be demolished with amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekers were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, an advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the case of HIV infected patients with severe immune defective (ART), it can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunist infections. (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In each case patients, which received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dosified Ritonavir (degrees 2 to 4) and Laboratories (degree 2 to 4) and CPK values which were reported among patients who received agenerase together with low dosified kaviavir, very often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of overdose the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary measures to initiate policies.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amspecavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protein, thereby preventing the process mapping of viral and gag-pol- polyproteinstages with the result of an education unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The anti-viral activity of Amspecavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymphobic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood cytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% permentration (IC50) of amspecavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in acute infected cells and amounts to 0,41 µm for chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of speckled against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretroviral not pre-treatable patients with the currently approved Fosamavir / Ritonavir dosiations were - as with other Ritonavir ooed treatment schemas with Proteaseinhibitors - the mutations rarely observed only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not subject to patients, the 700mg of Fosdinavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, came a virologistic failure to week 48, with 14 isolate genotypically evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the insure of 13 out of 14 children, with whom a virologistic failure inside the 59 included, with proteasets did not occur in patients, showed Rescue patterns, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2025">On genotypical Rescue-based analysis of genotypic interpretations systems can be applied to the estimation of the activity of Amspecavir / Ritonavir or Fosamspecavir / Ritonavir in patients with protectionist isolates isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamspecavir / Ritonavir is defined resistance as the presence of the mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a heightened phenomenal resistance with kaviavir and a decreased probability of a virological contact (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data, and it is advised to continually pull up the current interpreting systems to the analysis of the results of pesticides.</seg>
<seg id="2028">On phenotypical Rescue-based analysis Clinically validated phenotypic interpretations systems can be used in conjunction with genotypical data to assess the activity of Amspecavir / Ritonavir or Fosamspecavir / Ritonavir in patients with protectionist isolates isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed sounding-phenotypic Cut-offs (divides) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a pesticides.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to amspecavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, cimavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for the crossresistance between Amspecavir and other protesters for all 4 Fosamspecavir resumes, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral failed patients, in which a Fosamavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), ddinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), sainviolr / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (4 of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amspecavir keeps its activity against some other protectionist drug resistant isolates; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on number and type of resistance mutations in isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early recovery of a wasted therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries that may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI passing adults according to virologically (100 mg twice daily) and Nuclosidanana (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest Ritonavir "gebooert," received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threeone hundred threes (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-underperplexity of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adated average change of the output (AAUCMB) in the virus-load (HIV-1-RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub-shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of unbiased aforesase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, which were treated 152 with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, agenerase solution has been taken from 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosified kaviavir was given at the same time; the majority of the patients with PI-negotiated patient had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTI.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml during a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output.</seg>

<seg id="2046">Hence the minimum concentration in the steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent disposed of volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amspecavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in plasma, being the amount of serverless amspecavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unmatched amspecs remains constant, fluctuates the percentage part of the free active component during the automation intervalls in the steady State over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated patients approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there is no data about long-term healing rates available for more than 36 months after the treatment, in the supervisor Basalcellular or other appropriate treatment forms should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with relapsing and subject-negotiated BCCs do not exist any clinical experience, so the application is not recommended in previous tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial suggest that major tumours (&gt; 7,25 cm2) have a reduced probability of contact on the Imiquimod therapy.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was primarily examined the safety of the drug, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by investigating its impact on reducing GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme the GAG concentrations in urine is about 60%, and half of the treated children reported at the end of the study a normal large liver.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side-effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side-effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen permeation (a measuring size of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may be used in patients who may possibly be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European drug Agency (EMEA) will review all new information each year, which may possibly be known and is required to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is received patients who are given Aldurazyms in regard to the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission granted the Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transfer of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cells (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is contraindicated for long-term enzymes in patients with warranted diagnosis of a Mukopolysacchariosis I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase-deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing this, every 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no precluzation scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no precluzation scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients can develop infueled reactions which are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should be monitored much tightly and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in a reasonable stage setting, in the revitalisation facilities for medical emergencies immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, it is expected to form nearly all patients IgG-antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in handling the treatment for a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment has been cautious.</seg>

<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium-sized infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and acetaminophen / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and acetaminophen / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be recorded with a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistaminika and acetaminophen / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular recording of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow directly or indirect impact on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, who were exponated against the laronidase across the mother's milk, is advised to do not satisfy the treatment with Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions in clinical studies were reported mainly as infusion reactions which were observed at 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug interactions observed in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the period of 5 years or older during a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-associated involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history also occurred severe reactions, including Bronzes, respiratory and facial skin (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children of undesirable drugs relating to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phas- 2 study involving 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe form-form and a treatment duration up to 12 months, reported are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously each week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">With most patients it occurred within 3 months after the commenced treatment of a seroconversion, where patients at the age of 5 with more severe form of age occurred during a month (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients no more ectable by radio immunostensivity (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies before, including 3 patients, in which it never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to low antibody levels expelled a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the harn, while in patients with high antibody titres was a variable reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in Phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutrality inhibitor effect on enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to interfere with clinical effectiveness and / or reducing GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug actions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug actions typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of an additional accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the cycle and cells into the lyosomes, most likely about Manners-6-phosphorous receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placeased phase 3-trial of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which expelled the entire disease range, was the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only a patient dismissed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had a forciated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label evaluation study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to the placebo group enhancing the lung function and the salary, which is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks to the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period of time and the absolute volume of lung lobina increased proportionately to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant increase in the GAG mirror in the harn (µg / mg Kreatinine) has been fixed, which remained constant due to the degree of study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease cases between patients suffering from the combination of a combined end point, clinical trials in the 6-minute walk-test, movement area of the shoulder bag, AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmacogenetics of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients, which at the time of their intake were under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy relational form and 4 with the middle sections).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (a other medicine against cancer) in patients suffering from cancer (medicines for cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) or is likely to deteriorate slightly to other parts of the body. • Advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attacks the epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have previously had not been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously have previously received other chemotherapy regimen as the sole treatment is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should be taken during treatment with Alimta a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, should prior to or after the gift of cisplatin in addition an "antiemeal" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to avoid a fluid lack of damage).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose bleeding changes or where certain other side-effects occur, the treatment should be pulled up, set or reduce the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slow the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form occurs easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a major study on 456 patients, Alimta has been studied in a major study on 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy, compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in one study to 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin, survived by 12.1 month, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with Alimta 8,3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, patients were not reported in the case of cancer epithelial cells, at the administration of Alimta for longer survival than with the comparison of comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued the Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transfer of Alimta to the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each iteracy must be solved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium hydrochloride (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary Do- SIS is taken from the Role bottle and with 0.9% Sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml further diluted (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is displayed in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial histology (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA is shown in a second-line treatment for patients with lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-cellular bronchial histology (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronze, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">For the reduction of the frequency and severity of Hautreach, the day before and on the day of Pemetrexed Gift, as well as the day after the treatment a corticosteroid were given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued during the whole treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need a intra-muscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third party action cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who received Pemetrexed should be created before every gift created a full blood picture - the, including a differentiation of the leucocytes and the thyroid counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The Alkalische phosphorase (AP), aspartat Transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be &lt; 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dosage test must take place under Berücking of the Nadir of the blood billow or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the prior therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which apply to ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop-hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted by ALIMTA, until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be broken when in patients according to 2 dosages, an hematological toxicity or non-hematological Toxicity 3 or 4 occurs or so- continues in the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years old, or in comparison to patients aged 65, there is an increased rate of risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data to inconsistency and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, no dosage adaptations necessary to go beyond the recommended dosage recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient, therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver functionallisation of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- border trivia and / or transaminasenic of &gt; The 3.0-fold of the upper limits (in the presence of liver metastatic) not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the Knox markers and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute Neutrov number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Throgens and has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage reduction for other cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutrophics, Thrombozytenderness and maximally non-ugly toxizations, as observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lesser toxicity and a reduction of the level 3 / 4 hematological and nonwoven toxizations such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenie was beo-, when a pre-treatment had taken place with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients need to be instructed to use the patients treated with Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure for reduction of appropriate toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) need to avoid insimultaneous intake non-steroidal Antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylalanine (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindless Tens 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a therapy with Pemetrexed is provided, must take the intake of NSAIDs with long semi-expectant time for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with embosses (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, in which these events occurred, they had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid waste collection in the transcellular room a drainage of the ergometer can be weighed before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including Myocarardine, and cerebral vascular events have been reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, if this drug has usually been administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application-gentle limps (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of a irreversible flection of the reproductive capacity through Pemetrexed consists, men should be advised in front of the treatment - should be advised to obtain advice on sperm level.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses can result from nonsteroidal Antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylate in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) to a decreased deemxed trition using the result of a multiplication of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Actiontylcopic acid can be used in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindless Tens 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-time experience like Piro- xicam or Roomoxidib, the simultaneous application must be avoided with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the tinness status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of INR (International normative ratio) if the decision was taken to treat the patient, the patios with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but like ande- Antimestolites are expected to occur in pregnancy heavy birth defects during an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if absolutely verifiable and after careful deliberation of consumption for the mother and risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity has been mixed by ememetrexed, men should be advised of the treatment course, consultation with regard to the blockade.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied at chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy for nausea and vomiting are (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of alxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemeal medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as it does not provide enough information to the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance uses a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies to 1 842 adults, the chemical therapies received, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are 59% of patients treated with aloxi, during the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (126 by 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are, showed 81% of patients treated with aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In one comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for aloon (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued the Warrior Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transfer of aloes by Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is contraindicated: to prevent nausea and vomiting with strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alxi to the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a corticosteroids prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonotic tron is able to extend the colon slices, patients should be monitored with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute icleus after injection molested.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable in the simultaneous approval of Palonotic tron with drugs called the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to be of such an extender.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemical therapist, Aloxi is supposed to be used neither in preventing chemotherapy nor to treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonotic AG does not impede tumors of the five investigated chemical therapies, Cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, a significant pharmacoidal interaction between a one-time intravenous dose Palonosis and a steady-stator concentration of a CYP2D6 Inhibitors showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmaceutical-based pharmacist analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inductors (Amiodartin, Cimetidin, meetdine, parinidine, marquavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonotic tron at human pregnancies lie not before, therefore Palonotic tron was not used in pregnant women, unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common ones observed in a dose of 250 micrograms of observing side-effects (a total of 633 patients), who at least possibly were related to Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity reactions and reactions to the appointment (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of unwanted events showed themselves as well as in other types of automation; there were no dose-drug relations to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the large volume of distribution, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy for a aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies were received a total of 1,132 patients who received an anti-etogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2,, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7 hours), given in day 1 without Dexamethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients, which received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cplatin, &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 microgram Palonotic tron, received in day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Studies of atively emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonotic tron on blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings pre-clinical investigations Palonotic tron has the ability to block the ion's ventricular function and polarized channels and lengthen the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EKG-effects of i.v. given inclement Palonotic tron in sustenosis of 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resignation After intravenous Gift follows a long-term elimination of the plasma centralised elimination from the body with an average terminological half time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire doses area of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonotic tron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average size (± SD) increases by day 1 and day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in the Palonotic tron Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">The pharmacocular simulations emerged that at once daily intravenous form of 0.25 mg of Palonotic tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with which according to one-time intravenous value was comparable; however, the Cmax was higher than 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys, and about another 50% are transformed into two primary materials, which in comparison to Palonotic tron is less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for Metabolization have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonotic tron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonotic tron was an unaltered substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a time-time intravenous bolt at healthy, the total body was between 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While in patients with severe liver disease, the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonotic tron increases, a reduction in the dose is thus not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies revealed that Palonotic tron is only able to block in very high concentrations of Ionencanals, which are involved in ventricular determinants and repolarization and can prolong the shareholders exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonotic tron (every dose has been given up in about 30tifold the therapeutic exposure to men) which were daily over two years, led to a multiply incidence of liver tumors, endocrine, pancreas, adrenal glands and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is designed for unique applications, the relevance of these results will be small compared to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the approval of approval for the drug is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C via Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injector.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon a biological drug called Roferon-A should resemble an effective component that is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Tool").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (one caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage caused damage, moreover, the values of the liver encyclopeotransferase (ALT) are significantly increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced that stimulates this to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data containing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredients, composition and purity of the drug, active ingredient, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy approval of Alpheon is compared to the efficacy approval of the reference practitioner to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured, as many patients following 12 of total 48 treatments, as well as 6 months after hiring the treatment to the drug (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with HCV, which spoke to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After hiring the treatment with Alpheon flame retardant the disease was again found again in more patients than with the terms of reference; in addition, Alpheon had more side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, the study was evaluated in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins, against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (one with cracking infection) and small infected crops (cracking or cutting), chopped off and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against these kinds of infections might not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not talking about the treatment two to three days, the doctor should again investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was clashed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-perges, Altargo and cefalexin similar contact: if the results of both studies were taken together at home performance, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, found that Altargo is found in the treatment of abscesses (time-filled hollow habitats in the body tissues) or infections that were to be verified or presumably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee on human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo could outweigh the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections regarding the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lainations, chordances or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group Ltd. for approval for the transfer of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, during which two to three days are no improvement, should be investigated once and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising or serious local irritation by applying Retapamine Salbe, the treatment is canceled, the salvibe carefully wiped out and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin does not apply to the treatment of infections in which MRSA as pathogen is known or suspected (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies involving secondary wounds, the efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections, which were caused by a methyl-resistent Penhylococcus aureus (MRSA) insufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is expected to be considered, when after a 2-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected point occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which have been reached in humans according to topical skin or infected superficially wounds, a clinically relevant hemicality in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous Gift of 2-times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean reapamulin Auc (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retapamulin obe on deported skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be considered, if topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a precinctive oxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the Federal Statistical / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamine Salbe should be used only during pregnancy, if a topographic antibacterial therapy is clear and applying reapamulin to be preferred to the gift of a systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / finished / ended or the therapy with Altargo can be continued / terminated is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies conducted in 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied was the most frequently reported side effect iration of the administration site which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Workaround Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance, characterized by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckery) isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The remechanism of reapamulin depends on the selective inhibitor of bacterial protynthesis by interacting in a certain linkage of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosoms which differs from the relationships of other ribosomal interaggrading anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the bond-hole of the Bosnian Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-links and the Peptidylactic centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment to this linkage, the Puromutiline supports the Peptidylindings, block partially P-bonds interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin should be harmless at least some infection-forms, a consultation by experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in In-vitro activity of reapamulin towards S.aureus, regardless of whether the insults were delicate or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Transcription In a study involving healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointine was launched daily by occlusion into intact and ported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% reapamine salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topographic treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, single plastics were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 for adult patients, both before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the final application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 skigsaw skin (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The revitro oxidative Metabolism in human liver microsomnia was introduced primarily by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect Hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases related to the liver) in children between the ages of 1 and 15 who are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix is applied within one of two doses of existing vaccines, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that from two doses can be led to an existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another HCV or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have effects by promoting the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as opposed to a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same ingredients as the Twinrix adults have been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix kids will meet within the framework of one of three doses of the vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as testament to the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations in a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient rix led at between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient pressure was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side-effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain on injection, redness, mating (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who might be hypersensitive (allergic) to active substances, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission issued the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the transfer from ambient rix to the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardization Plan for Grundimmation with ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate monoval vaccines or with a combination of binational vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis-B- surface anti-hepatitis type (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis-A-virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination by the respective monovalents vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured, such as immunological individuals who have addressed on a CV-A- vaccination should need a refresher as protection, as it may also be protected by immunological memory by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injection molding substances, you should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the Standardial scheme is recommended with the combination simpbined, the 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg recombinantes hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In cases of hematalysis and individuals with disorders of the immune system, under certain circumstances, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies is achieved, so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required.</seg>

<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and estrogen-going clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolization and excretion of sodium polyphenylath is carried out via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney failure should only be applied with extreme care.</seg>

<seg id="2892">If a PCI was carried out in other episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and infusion should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI can be applied according to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt from 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage from angiox for patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus gift by Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to 225 seconds, a second bolt from 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values, this should be properly mixed and diluted medicines in front of the application carefully and the boldosis quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney functionality, (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second Bolusdosis is administered by 0,3 mg / kg and once again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney injury, which resulted in the phase III- PCI study (Replace-2) which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudine-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In people with severe renal damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood, especially if Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI-patients under Bivalirudine, most bleeding occur in arterial point infection, can occur in patients suffering from a peraneous anti-surgical interventions (PCI) during the treatment generally occur anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients, taking the warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR-Werts (International Standards Organisation) should be considered to ensure the value of drafting the bivalirin din once again reached the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolysis or Thrombozytenstadationshemmer), it can be assumed that these agents are raising the danger of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudine with Thrombozytenorial aggregations or anticoagulants are the clinical and biological hemostasis parameter in any case regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy, the embryonic cofoal development, unequipping or postnatal development (see below 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either infractionable yeast or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding have been defined by the ACUITY and TIMI units for heavy bleeding as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bivalirudine alone significantly less often than in the groups with Heetin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor and Bivalidated plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intractive or surgical intervention required, hematbular bleeding or blood pressure in the pation point, the reduction of the hemostglobinar of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood-point, reoperation due to a bleeding, use of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less often observed blood localisations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctuation, retroperitoneal, gastrob, ear, nose or neck.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In the case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately dismantled and the patient engmaschige with regard to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinary inhibitor that binds both on the catalytic centre and the animonenbindings region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or on straight line.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bivalirudine at Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is splits off the bond of Bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thus reducing the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudine with Serum of patients, in which it came in the past too heterosexual cytopmal Syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no Thrombolic Aggregation reaction induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudine provides a dose-dependent anti-cooperative action that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out in the patients a PCI was given an additional bolt from 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudine and the infusion should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is applied to the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the waiter-poor injected or administered as infinfusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the blood pressure (sugar) in the blood or may not process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin is very negligible, and the change means that it has a faster effect and has a shorter activity time than a short-effective humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-lasting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes in which the body of insulin can not be effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance glycosylated heroglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adult type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c-concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra compared to 0.30% in human standard.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any of the other components, or in patients suffering already in hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission shared Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transfer of Apidra in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injections, either in the area of the stomach-blanket, the thruthmus or the delusion or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconegenesis capacity and reduction of insulin, the insulin need to be low in patients with a restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity, the trademark (Her- Steller), the insulin type (normal, NPH, or delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin delivery) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the demolition of a treatment, in particular in patients with an insulant diabetes, may cause hyperglycaemia and a diabetic cetoaziosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or a insulin delivery should take place under strict medical supervision and may make a modification of the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that can increase the blood sugar blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemics, angiotensin-Converting, fibrosis, pentoxidiyllin, propoxyps, Salicylates and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetics such as Betablockers, Clonidine, Guanethide in and reserpine to be the symptoms of the adrenal gland in regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproduction of reproduction showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and Humanist in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic cofoal development, birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin enters into human mother's milk, but generally insulin takes place in the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following the clinical trials known from clinical trials are listed, grouped according to system organs and ordered by decreasing incidence of their occurrence (very frequently: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is not transferable).</seg>

<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycemics with consciousness can be treated by intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person, or treated by the intravenous form of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glisagonal infection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the cause of the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose levels (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous ga- be insulin, the effect takes place faster and the active time is shorter than in hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, the insulin range from 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a dose of proportionate, glucose resistance, and at 0,3 E / kg or more a low proportion of glucose levels, just like humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin is growing at almost twice as fast as normal humanism and generates the complete draft carving effect about 2 hours earlier than humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control is achieved like with human normal urging, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulinlulisin 2 minutes before the meal was done, a better postpranal control was achieved than with humanistic standard, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal commenced, a comparably glycaemic control as with human normal attachment, which is given 2 Mixed before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
