the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
for more information about using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual too &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings extensions ... open the mapping software tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list with standard deposit modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have any additional software installed .
you should install the package base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of ab@@ duc@@ ts if available , extingu@@ ish .
the module dedicated Fil@@ ters ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Menu , under ex@@ tras . with the module , you can filter up @-@ to @-@ date sub@@ directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M construction view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; use ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree to display ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root elements of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are under@@ elements of this root .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the m@@ ime type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ ing and text views in order to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ y@@ te folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , its surface is proportionate to its size . this size must possess that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected , if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , FS@@ View can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ at@@ map representation constitutes a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for simpler navigation , you possess the right corner of meaningful colours and cap@@ tion settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched via view mode , can be either very deep for the slight recognition of the cas@@ ings , or the illustration of a different file , such as name , owner , group or m@@ ime type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or the folder . for each property you can specify , if enough space to display is present or if the area of sub@@ ordinate rect@@ angle may be used ( where hence , display errors can be made by limitations in the sign @-@ map ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the marking in the rect@@ angle .
on display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule is not always observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entries . at the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always kept . there are limits to the tigh@@ tening of the entries . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangular square is square .
as spl@@ itting the area of a contract for sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is for the lab@@ eled and avoidance of space loss through frames always advantageous the surface to be made up as square . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive gra@@ ding .
you can specify the minim@@ alist area for an entry over the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern in the area of the superior item is drawn to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras , ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you call the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a torque to adjust the number of mini@@ images of each line in the gallery .
to display the fil@@ en@@ ame fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture you decide if the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown below the thumb@@ nail pictures in the gallery .
if you are showing a file size of the picture , you decide if file size is shown below the thumb@@ nail pictures in the gallery .
display image @-@ size picture shows if the size of images below the thumb@@ nails will be shown in the gallery .
in the dialog folder you decide where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folder should be included .
in file choice Save in HTML file you give where the HTML @-@ page is to be saved .
with the transmission field sub@@ folder you can set with a sli@@ der or set @-@ up , until which level the sub@@ folders are included .
with the view@@ ings , original pictures can copy , whether the original pictures are to be copied into the gallery .
with the App@@ endi@@ x Com@@ mentary file you can specify a Com@@ mentary file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
if you specify a color box in a color box , you can set a different color @-@ colour in the original pictures for thumb@@ nails .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings offers easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras . the following behavior of the web@@ browser can be defined here :
you can find media play@@ back for the navigation area in the Shipping Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under windows navigation , or on the button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation section of the Shipping Con@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear into the media play@@ back .
browser detection adds one menu entry in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; added to which you can change the browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is helpful for Web sites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browsing of the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( / ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ ec@@ ko ) . if you are denied on a website that uses the access to this browser , change the browser detection in one of the following options .
modify the identification in MS@@ IE for pages that reject the access with browsers based on Mozilla . you need for instance the MS@@ IE browser detection to call with the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail call .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use the own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes , are properly presented with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option will use the provided browser detection for all pages of the website you are visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the menu entry , you can set the scope of the information using the browser and operating system in the individual .

one easy to use camera comp@@ utation is made available to you to connect with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking ; together .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to review and correct your photos , comment , evaluate and correct the processing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plug@@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although it came out ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional abilities to use . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color and all available modules support raw conver@@ ging using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC dy@@ es work@@ flow - Work@@ flow .
improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg , above the camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also came from checking ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end user . therefore you should report to problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to report the reporting of problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you use this short@@ cut , your web browser opens a page in the error corrected . all required information is included here . just follow the instructions to send your review .
checking came ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; checking , then we would like to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , you should soon speak English , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also check out the publication ; homepage to receive news on shared releases and other information about &amp; checking ;
the best start to take part on &amp; checking ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance on arrival in the developer mailing list of &amp; checking came ; .
when you have arrived ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remot@@ ely folder . simply enter P@@ adding names or click on the folder icon in order to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored for all images .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; Thank you ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings will be set up .
if you have already a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the pictures can specify as a base folder . at this time , each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during the passage of the folder you get a step indication of how to see this :
&amp; digi@@ tization ; dur@@ ably cap@@ turing the libr@@ ad in its whole depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folder , unless it iste into hiding folder . this can take you exceptionally , by taking a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder of photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not take photos as symbols . you can take the changes by taking any sort of photo from the album and put this on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums .
once you configure the root folder , you can set up &amp; checking ; your digital camera set up . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords , to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ure Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can change ; possibly also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help .
how you set this up and working with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ es and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
one easy to use camera comp@@ utation is made available to you to connect with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then also appears as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images of digital cameras to machines and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . because photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions on the serial port , this connection has been outdated . &amp; nbsp ; supports these cameras and introduces the transmission of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photographs 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nail shots . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ ami@@ 2 , you might not be able to stand back@@ stage or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things there has been checking out is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image Plug @-@ Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modul structure , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to complete , checking out ; by writing a small module to complete a function as the changes occurred in &amp; checking ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the margins with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and disc@@ ard images will work anywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture does not occur in keywords , date list or search .
- a date selection allows you to release the com@@ promised : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently shown in the symbol view . so the filter appears on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is displayed symbolic view also . what fields are shown can be set in the dialog of the settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; puts an organized view on your photo@@ sets . all the photos taken by &amp; digi@@ tization are stored in a single album tree , in which they were created on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ ds or by the date when the album was first created , sorted in the features of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan this album directly to an album . simply select album Im@@ ported Screen photo .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it . in the then off menu you &apos;ll have to select whether the image is moving through moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them onto the target album .
one album contains a collection of photos and the album features , allow you to provide information about this collection . to access the album features , you must click with the right mouse button , click on the album and edit tab &apos;s menu features .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method of highlight your albums , so that you can select under a common name , when you choose collection from the tool@@ bar , or view albums @-@ sort by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this within the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - date : is used when you sort out your albums by date with view albums After date sort by date .
the buttons , average , neu@@ ester : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average section of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first entered an album , then the first picture is listed as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; selected . this is designed to help you remember the pictures in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ time preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be swal@@ lowed up .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supported the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of my key@@ word list on the left below in the main window . album collections have any other effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin slip in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time you have to wait in short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to avoid , in which you can create ex@@ tras all the thumb@@ nails .
information about each image will be displayed below the site preview . what information this is , you may change about settings ; to change . select the albums and adjust the image layout to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have a moment to rest . if you ho@@ ver a moment about a picture , the help shows the most important features including all cat@@ chment of a photos . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduc@@ tory panel shows such a Help window .
photos are all what it came from &amp; checking ; goes . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures exactly as it suits you . you can preview all the features that come with &amp; checking ; possible , via the contex@@ tual menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing of the images , a slide or editing of the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by calling and Edit ... select either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the right @-@ menu menu of the image , with the right mouse button and Edit ... select . in the section you find a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and edit them .
it may happen that &amp; checking came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the right @-@ click menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how you can adapt to your needs if your program is not enumer@@ ated , you will find information in the text box ; manual .
you should note that after editing , using other image processing programs can come to problems with the met@@ adata included in the image . some programs do not store this data using the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides two options for rotating the right mouse button , click on the thumb@@ nail and select the turning point . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; checking ; extingu@@ ish , it will be moved into the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; postponed . F@@ 8 image Dele@@ te or Ent@@ f If you rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f use .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ ums@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organized your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used by either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change in the file .
selecting a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et bottom in the file map , that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and to catalog . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by choosing this key@@ word or search .
when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos that are marked with this key@@ word are displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords , as well as parts of the Bau@@ ms &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the tags you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and proven key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the tags at the loss of the database re @-@ imported , as soon as checking came ; the pictures noted .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords quot ; or to an existing key@@ word . if you have a new keywords , after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this is the sub@@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keywords will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired location in the tree and drop there . then , a menu that gives you the possibility to push the keywords . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and click in the context menu key@@ word . you can edit the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My keywords &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; My keywords &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click in the right @-@ click menu When night@@ time preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
to get rid of their functionality , you first need to use your photos with key@@ word . this can be done on two kinds : once you want to put the pictures you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , etc . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and assign them from the context menu key@@ word .
you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will appear once you choose one of the keywords it has been assigned to it . in this way you can select a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you click with the right mouse button of the photo menu and select from the menu menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline &apos;s view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the drop @-@ frame which displays the time unit . this puts all the related pictures in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dating stamp , and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ula he search box is a small lamp the green is when the search takes place . if you click here the filtering will be cleared and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . you can save this search a simple search box as the one described above . you can save this search here however as live search , which always fil@@ tered you as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved it , it removed filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the text field reads as is used to select your request a name in My search list . if you want to change your choice after searching again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in his context menu .
if you want to edit search , the form appears to enter the search again with the previous search information . if you want to edit the advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search , to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for search . further information can be found in section The tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an expan@@ sive search form with a lot of search parameters , with which you have been checking in certain fields from &amp; checking ; s database may be requested .
the list of searches is used to reset the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . any option can delete or delete from this list . any option may be linking with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or Mind@@ sc@@ ... . in addition , you can search for Type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare pictures by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two pic@@ sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one . by means of a spon@@ ge , the result choice may be increased or down@@ sized . if you slide a picture of anywhere on the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a fast sketch and checking ; find the matching pictures . also here you can set a swelling value .
this rider provides an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . you can drag it into a square . click C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker Maus@@ kno@@ b button to pull a square . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images Ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ folder .
after checking , provides a lumin@@ ous in a separate window which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image files , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em &apos;s table will be added from the context menu . the selection is opened to the lumin@@ aire and opened its window . when you come back in checking , main window , you can open the lumin@@ tically fast with L ex@@ tras .
from the thumb@@ bar you can draw the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and put there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window range is displayed . if you are sne@@ ak preview from the tool@@ bar , then these are executed with the other image too . so you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to switch quickly out of a picture series . if you use pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the left first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields of view . the right click image is displayed in the right area . this is easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire as well as F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all pictures from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the fluor@@ ite . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you find a built @-@ in she@@ w function , which you can recognize at the crossed arrows . in order to stop the visible area of the picture , you have to click this and see the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator under the images or c@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ wheel to get in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are pre@@ viewed in the mode .
what is a digital inventory ? digital inventory at all part of the process follows after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory . but most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient fashion .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , use , protect and use photos again . at the same time , we look at the procedures for digital photographers , to use , convert , group@@ ing , review , archiving , archiving , reviews , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secur@@ es , trans@@ forms , compliant and exported content which fav@@ ors a mon@@ et@@ arian or cultural value .
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata products are provided in accordance with your definition , provide information on or documentation of other data created by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you don &apos;t even know how 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t want to have a certain photo . . the approach to save met@@ adata both in a database and in the images guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before doing anything in your system is to build up information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide if other access to your photos are to be stored on your computer or on a network drive , etc ; note that you will have to change on a bigger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly find out about your location . the remaining photos will be organized on the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders in@@ as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers can have other requirements , such as publishers , archiving , work processes , constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % files have to be organized and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for that content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking process easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and the migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to store the met@@ adata page in the file content page . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget it , then you can subsequently store the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the item &apos;s menu item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is going to change ? you have a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , and these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you now need any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images , which need the same attribute and then set the value . it is best to start with the review or the ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the further work on the best photos .
let &apos;s now talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently lodge in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alo@@ ised images from another source using embedded keywords , then it will then change the tree for you and paste the pictures to the right place . the sor@@ eness of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by taking a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be monitored by &amp; checking ; updated while it is the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata re@@ produces . this is a very rough representation , since every block of met@@ adata consists in truth from many sections . data stream and calendar dates can be found in all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ adata .
you want most anyone want to let your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos are arriving .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that is the landing stage of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Revolution the 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time is back present , you may even hear the silence . thus , your perception of this panor@@ amas completely changed .
for others who consider your photos may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help Him learn about the mot@@ if you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work alone with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
with &amp; B , you can use any number of text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE is even exported to you for a selection of pictures . you will have to tell you a spelling for your wishes in the marking and / or the title of the web server system . so you have to tell the story for the opening hours no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation is already with speed speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will continue in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also open your trips with Google Earth . this then shows the photos on the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the google@@ maps to export .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a game of copyright and describes the practice to use copyright law to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms should also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information came out of the layout page , which should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creators and writers ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organisation . after which this value was saved , it should not be changed any longer . this field does not support Com@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : An@@ cler@@ k photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a comment on the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this should not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a warehouse photo , the group / Agency lists the image here .
it is important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers may delete or change the solution to this problem . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
digital water@@ marks is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will provide such a module for the st@@ acking processing in the near future .
themes : panel error , blackout , cl@@ ashes , EC@@ C , transmission defect , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ation , life time , temperature , data @-@ proof super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper @-@ photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ organization in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be handled these pre@@ dict@@ ated and you can no longer think than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs within archiving quality . there are offers about gold p@@ iled DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe that is in your sur@@ ve@@ room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can store good dis@@ ks and good reception equipment and keep them in the right way . the best DVD reception tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to defects even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , use 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and controlling light , scrat@@ ches light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to work with Windows and &amp; Linux . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppies , hard@@ disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ cs appear to save the For@@ mer War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus nearly sixty @-@ layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good reception device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ oc@@ ative format . afterwards , read the media with a description , date &amp; author label and then stored on a clean , dark @-@ dry and before animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturer keeps your statistics for itself . your manufacturing company will include a new disk , but not the data . Google puts on this topic a large field study on the error @-@ mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ inf@@ r@@ ame
in brief : Dis@@ ks hold on the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ament of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . electronic components of the controller are the most common error @-@ purpose , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART claims are the most immediate effect . these are especially les@@ bian and publishing enumer@@ ations . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss process because of over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power if you have secured the files , but those losses usually can be produced without big problems .
while most electrical appliances do not account much , that is different from devices with computer chips and high speed processors differently . these can cause serious harm . at your computer , these abnorm@@ alities , complete data loss , hardware switch , destructive motherboard and other defects can result . protect yourself in front of the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against rap@@ ins is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy @-@ heat and ob@@ serves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a st@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar . but remember that not every st@@ ec@@ ker@@ chief contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it offers protection against ligh@@ tening and thus protects the properly connected devices .
because an over@@ voltage each cable can use to your computer , you should be sure that also all peri@@ pher@@ als devices are attached to your computer . this also applies to telep@@ hon@@ ors and cable mo@@ de@@ ms that also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television .
if you have an ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system before smaller variations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an emergency of few seconds may result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a sub @-@ breaking power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power cut occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the power is running . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
concern yourself at the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety at the cost of avoiding this . a high quality assurance protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are high priced compared to the hard drives , although very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local loss of data . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution Online . the professional version makes you more available , in case of Flickr dramatic more . for 25 $ per year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the perspective of data security , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatic thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ secure .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ umps provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection within your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable grid parts are another source of transmission losses since they generate interference within the data flow . if normal fil@@ es@@ ystems this error remains un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to behave in low levels and is highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is available soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ation fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms the z@@ fs used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss loss in the notebook and 46 % in the job systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most seas . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to loss of data as proprietary Systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Ex@@ it , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the common file systems . a very good English article here can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data : wron@@ g@@ ly , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the major contribut@@ ors for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture fr@@ aming of fundamental physical boundaries . meant that while the technology is developing further there is a natural border for that progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality op@@ tics are the optimum for compact cameras . even D@@ SLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk will get you today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a Plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ install of your OS , the exchange of records or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external drive on an external drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster hits locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do you forget air products : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
hence , Des@@ aster prevention means not a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot of the history of a snapshot , and it represents a complete copy at a time .
difference backup : a backup of the files that have been changed for the past year . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ als .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes from a version@@ ing system next to the exception which is only cleared and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to Script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmis@@ sions , only the difference of the files really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security above ssh .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or other optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file ( IP ) information , original X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ find images and met@@ adata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature is un@@ predictable , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate each other while the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain vigil@@ ance to leave . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is down@@ ward compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the question of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system , that reading your pictures is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means constantly growing .
let &apos;s assume that you plan the scal@@ ability with you and enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy to this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it up .
&amp; Dollar ; dd / dev / s@@ d@@ b # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ b # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 ; res@@ iza / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ es@@ op@@ fs if necessary
open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year .
gif is a proprietary format that is slowly falling from the market . so you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard designed to replace the G@@ IF . however , it can save X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG used it requires lots of administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and have a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F has been widely used as an image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression @-@ fixing plug ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however , that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed free and open air @-@ format designed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to using met@@ adata . a hand@@ handful of camera pers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nik@@ on it at some time .
this is probably one of the reasons why , to replace Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is an extension of XML and quot ; .x@@ ls ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the shell format . X@@ MP fits in , since it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw @-@ format is ver@@ ted . therefore , you should think if you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports its fully compatible online met@@ adata to support the work of D@@ C@@ MI and D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the images on cam@@ er@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your shell archive . this function has not yet been implemented .
for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; checking ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under certain programs under certain circumstances .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first into web galleries , add them to MPEG , you use in contact leaves , print you &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking ; in the section Add a photo to an album , you can add photos , which you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your al@@ ben@@ database .
to convert your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode , and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , this tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras , you can take a while . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames appears and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page &apos;s features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a one or its met@@ adata .
this dialog displays files properties and the photographic information that can be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. the image . this information is the same as when the met@@ adata page came from the main window of &amp; checking ; or the picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata with some digital cameras are not available .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos of her camera into a single album . . downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard optional methods from &amp; k@@ de . as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download the chosen item . the button to download is so long until you selected some pictures selected .
if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these pictures were not recorded until now . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview display . if you choose this option , you will of course only download the new pictures .
when you use the buttons All download or select the chosen item , appears a dialog , with which you can choose the target album . the list of existing albums is displayed as a normal folder . details about the folder you can read in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and checking out ; the pictures from the camera invites you to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once , by checking the button delete All . if you only want to delete some , you need to select it first and then delete the selected information .
note that there is no possibility there are photos that you deleted from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; so you should carefully check if the pictures have been removed successfully in the camera . if you do not want to delete them from the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally used again after the pictures are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be reasonable , the date and time when the image was made to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and sp@@ lash of the image and for dat@@ alog@@ ous subscribers . if you use this last option , a folder per day is automatically created .
the options on the transmission opens up three more options that are performed before the photos on the disk will be stored . if you choose this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want to use a different date format than standard format , you can e.g. use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % N % H : % S : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ ing@@ time .
when you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , which has been checking , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera display next time .
after checking out , all the information about the orientation of the camera can be used at the time of downloading . not all cameras get this information ready . in the section page bar met@@ adata , you can read further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , leaves you release , the photo in its original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and choose Autom@@ atic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera is provided with information about the date when the photo was made , it may be charged . these sub @-@ files are downloaded on the image data . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same under@@ album . in the section page bar Met@@ a data you can read out which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case res@@ umes , checking the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you have to use this option . use the button Advanced and select the option of File @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from her computer to her camera is the button . select then upload . the file server dialog box ; appears in which you can select the files up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is done , ask &amp; checking ; you , where the images will be up@@ loaded . a folder @-@ selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term used in this document . thus , a position that is stated in the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude , and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to sim@@ ulate an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate bro@@ kers can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can access a browser which indicates the area . if you want to post a postcard to another , or simply want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to store the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 has been supported in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , about a post @-@ editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recipients . either as a map module or through the transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye EV@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on D@@ SLR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and the GPS and can cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tu@@ dinal and other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ d coordinates , which can be created e.g. by map@@ S.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com with no European road@@ maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , who show all the navigation details for Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been trying to give you much control of his working procedures as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to access these settings , you have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sel@@ ection dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the entry dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
action can be displayed in an embedded preview or editing pane . so you place the default behavior of checking , firm if you click on an entry in the view view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ identity and copyright data . these data are automatically selected to the relevant IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected for downloading the camera department . even with a database synchron@@ isation , these data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author is a syn@@ onym for fiber head@@ line : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations like a cler@@ k photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the image of the photo . this should not be the author , if this image is listed here for a news agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a warehouse , then the group or agency that provides the image is available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the relevant IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . thus , the met@@ adata is permanently contained in the image and not only came into the database of checking ; these met@@ adata also are available to other programs and can be imported from time to time ; they shall be imported without lost .
images to be embedded in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions included also by other images . this can be over@@ written by the cap@@ tions , they will be over@@ written by the pictures .
the site settings includes all options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window on a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supported a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types and file came ; to specify , you can add and remove file exten@@ ders of this list . any folder which none of these extensions will be removed from checking ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right of each category .
the configuration of the lumin@@ aire has been updated on this page . each time , if you then open the light@@ table , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get better application results .
by default , the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different colour , you can select this one here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ rated areas of an image can be marked with darker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colours will be fixed here . in the picture editing , this view can be inserted and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please refer to this article in Wikipedia to the near@@ er explanation .
with setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG used a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F files comp@@ ress you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ists for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is working out .
with the adjustment of losses of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can also save losses . even if you have been written down the loss of loss , the relation between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization , the image processing was only an image asset for photos . currently , it is rapidly developing a tool for manipulation your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing .
the default gain is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option if you use this option with minimal loss of details . this option makes the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2@@ x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white @-@ off the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not set off . standard is to use a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that bel@@ ated images in four steps get more details in the hair@@ pin . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is it the nickname , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to view the hair@@ line . the setting colors will trigger some fancy results , since they display the hair@@ line in different Ros@@ kil@@ ns . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the hair@@ pin .
this is possible because blue pixel has generally not become so fast so@@ aked like green and red . therefore , and d@@ cra@@ w are trying to re@@ construct the missing green@@ - and red @-@ shares from the still un@@ saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question how much color or what you want .
if you choose to re@@ construct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the picture options offered . to keep the time for the humili@@ ation small , you should take conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ kel@@ etal algorithm is a digital image process to comp@@ ose a complete image from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image , which provides many cameras and which makes a matrix color @-@ like pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ design .
after checking , and D@@ cra@@ w present you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color @-@ fac@@ et at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color gra@@ zing of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are carried out during the raw material .
a profile transl@@ ates the color formations and there are instructions how they are to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and checking ; information such as the color formations were translated into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
conduct issues when a picture opens in the image editing , the file @-@ administration module will start with raw files .
color profile folder Set@@ ting the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; nbsp ; examines this folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour @-@ government view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color@@ fully not the whole screen .
the input profiles should fit into the camera and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently , there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color or g@@ amma correctly . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to perform for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate on how your image could be given from one device . this is very useful before you print picture , as your printer has a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore can function very saturated with you . this could you manually correct it instead of leaving the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that what color profile is planned for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . this answer is obviously in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style of the target : F for an accurate style , L for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image concerned and image editing ; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these will then be charged by checking ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the thumb@@ nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ list for tasks that are implemented by modules can be set in the menu under settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller carries the time between the image out@@ puts , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other ill@@ iter@@ ations turn on the met@@ adata , which ends at the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera features show a list of all available cameras on the left @-@ hand side . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to use the camera properly , switched on and in the image gallery . currently , here are prin@@ cipl@@ ed , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the cam@@ alis@@ te . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ n@@ sible , specify on which you attach your camera .
to convert your digital camera with &amp; checking , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
just try out if it came and checking ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera camera .
you can select any name for your camera ; it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; pictures in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can adjust the inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ eness of a photo . in the dele@@ tion of a photos and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
editorial changes through the right side bar , tac@@ it by &amp; digi@@ tization ; be applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without delay . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button .
you can also refrain from checking the welcome screen from &amp; checking ; at Star@@ linger , this acceler@@ ates the starting order from checking ; .
the setting starts looking for new photos and has been allowed to search for new , deleted albums / photos . this has length@@ ened the time folder after new or deleted albums / photos . if something was deleted from the base folder , asks , checking , whether it should delete them from the base folder .
various color @-@ schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be displayed under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are enumer@@ ated below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for checking , you will find further information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and improve and improve . editing can be made by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the menu menu , preview and selection of the listing advertisements .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules included , so you may not be part of your distribution . other information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current size picture shows .
a menu bar at the top and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of the image editing alter your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file . save the original shot from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot restore the original photo as soon as you saved the image .
so you should possibly install a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it off file .
as long as you do not have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or using the button Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last time .
virtually every action of the picture editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o back by selecting Edi@@ ting reg@@ res@@ ale or restored by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should do the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to the back cat@@ chy and re@@ make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ producing .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB for a moment in the tool@@ bar , you can press a right click menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed , either und@@ one or restored .
once you start the image editing , you can move between photos on the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation button in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current picture , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can get in the photo and get out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse @-@ wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the Pass@@ enger menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlargement factor automatically choose
full screen mode is displayed in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ cape key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can change this in the site dialog by &amp; checking ; change . you can view this from the layout page . see the section on setting up the image editing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print directly in the menu image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printed dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases . you &apos;ll need to select just the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu item expor@@ ters button . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the menu came ; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available , without the navig@@ ational shells , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five horse@@ tail is clicked on :
multi @-@ roof clicked on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar appear and disappear again in the edges .
in the description , you can enter or insert sign@@ ages with unlimited size . that means that all special characters are allowed . the marking are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and are shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC sign@@ ment field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions .
after you have commented on , you either use the button application or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are stored then .
besides the application button , there is a button free . with this you can write further met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , this is always done when you have chosen a met@@ adata setting which is always written in the pictures .
the review assessment shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting . it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the sampling map shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously included in this &amp; publication ; -@@ session included .
the key@@ word will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the search term . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is further relief when entering keywords at a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be placed by flag@@ ging of the appropriate att@@ achments in the tree . all tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC @-@ field Key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word menu , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to add a sample with a key@@ word , please read the keywords section .
the side@@ bar code filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ word and view@@ points . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the interface of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw on tags and disc@@ ard . suppose you have already selected several pictures in the main view . if the keywords already existed , you can easily drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . ther@@ eu@@ pon , a dialog , which you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the top example the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the sampling filter is reduced to No keywords , which is the quantity to three pictures . they were chosen with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word was drawn out of the right sample @-@ tree on the selection and sat there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . it can also be switched under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry where is looked for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc .
( 3 ) The argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options are then as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free disk space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I made it mainly for checking ; S concrete implementation was adapted .
the reason why you use a color@@ fully @-@ managed work@@ flow that is the colours available from your camera or scanner . with a color@@ fully servi@@ ced work@@ flow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web made of your Digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it must answer for the results he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on colour management . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions in order to obtain the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all six criteria specified below , you do not have to worry about paint @-@ management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB colour pattern . ( further information can be found below )
your only other figures are by E @-@ Mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so when S@@ GB works so well and life is so easy for everybody to do so , why should you use another color space and therefore have to worry about color managers ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ms , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to collect my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ms ?
yes ! whether you are working in R@@ GB Far@@ ms or not , you need to monitor your monitor that you ; on@@ ization on s@@ R@@ GB , therefore , closes the circle . if you are working as the C@@ GB of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to use either your monitor on the R@@ GB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic , and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rection Autom@@ atic correction are automatically trying to make the best of your colours . you will need to experiment with these effects , to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values about the whole image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shades . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
the same : this method j@@ us@@ hes the illumin@@ ance factor of the colours of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the Inten@@ sity area is as flat as possible . sometimes the final very good results in improving the contrac@@ tion of an image , sometimes it produces just rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which occurs either in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic Ab@@ same : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green@@ - and blue @-@ channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green@@ - and blue@@ berry channels to complete hist@@ ograms .
contrast , this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest levels of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off from checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a single photo .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited than using 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can operate too far from the original image , if you can perform the white @-@ off mode in the shell mode , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , then your ways of correction are better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ v@@ ist of copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white @-@ off the image processing .
the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see the original image as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original white @-@ picture again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target room has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pix@@ l under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you change one parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as , even in well @-@ lighted images , most pixels with very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , sati@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade of adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also perio@@ dically .
An@@ stat with the checks on the above run , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere to the picture show around which to use selected color for the calculation of color temperature of the white contrast . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
additionally you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preference settings . the following settings are available :
the Over@@ view indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel is over@@ exposed . they will appear the combined result in the white @-@ screen . this is seen in the preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image .
the buttons store as well as loading accurately this . each setting of the white , which you have set , you can save it in a text file and load it later .
the default settings returns all the filter values back to its default values and the net neutrality . keep in mind that even neutral settings will be another photo than your original . if you store this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the enco@@ ders per colour @-@ channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ Bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , processing time and stands on@@ ly@@ for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be drawn in the chapter administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under matching colours correctly . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same error , so you can always find the same correction . in the manual for sound correc@@ tions you will find more information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the result came ; tool F@@ oot effects presents you four coloured effects , a solar energy effect , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a c@@ ann@@ on filter at your disposal .
in times of the chemical processing , solar isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , was an effect of the created light . the colored , dark areas sheltered from the extra light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool allows you to nu@@ g this interesting effect fin@@ ely .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image illustrates what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional boost ultimately generates a negative image that is not to produce at phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and it is processed ( 2 ) . the intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation thus that it makes a stronger contradiction , which makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ at@@ ching . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for one on day@@ light fli@@ pped color movie made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ movie . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color but also some photo photographers , especially those who are barely given landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting channels . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ps re@@ ps the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . at large pictures , the filter can exp@@ el the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and the lumin@@ osity of your photos . all your adjustment can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the results you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too large sati@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / sati@@ ation will reduce a good choice for sati@@ ety instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool grades and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool for key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need for the explained application purpose only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ograms .
the window contains an graph@@ ene of the Inten@@ sity values , a hist@@ ogram , of active can@@ als or the selected range . under the graph@@ ene are three sli@@ ders into it and they can move to change the Inten@@ sity of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to move the regul@@ ator and to make sure how the picture changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic utility is useful .
three controllers : the top one for the dark notes , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color shades can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input holes of the shadow , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
exit : the excer@@ pts permits the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators used to modify the exit status , for example , use the compression rate can be used for example , to create a hidden image as a background to see something else in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the images are automatically set to dependence on the intention of the image .
save as and store : using these buttons , the used values can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loading again . the Gimp level is used .
if you use this mode and the three color shades , the input provides automatically for all shadows , resources and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original h@@ olog@@ ame for rot@@ or , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ loaded inde@@ xes controls all color channels to display superior pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the excer@@ pts are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically based on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that changes from the module :
in addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
if you post@@ p@@ one a Kur@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright notes with darker excerpt and that the image pixel will be darker .
the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the field you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve , showing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is placed to your taste .
save as and store : using these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you can create it can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loading . the file format is that Gimp is short @-@ format .
if you set this method and the three color shades , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the rot@@ tle , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ loaded inde@@ er @-@ indicator controls all color channels to display superior pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ as . shadow - and sun @-@ tones was placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the Canal @-@ Mix@@ er der &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the Canal @-@ Mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
with the can@@ al@@ op@@ tionally you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window displays a preview . the original can be seen in comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to blend this channels even if you change the appropriate color components , since the channel mix@@ er then is the tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible ru@@ ff which does not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose smoking pattern can be different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion thereby by reducing the color pattern first .
the save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender settings can thus save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mode .
the option over@@ loaded inde@@ xes controls all color channels to display superior pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a picture in the blue channel again and the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) to be seen .
black / white @-@ photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step , because color images can easily conver@@ ged on the computer . also , with a set of film roll@@ er@@ profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
Grün@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white footage with a green liner filter . this looks good at all scene images and fit especially well to portraits against the sky . so similarly to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
Oran@@ filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white footage with a orange filter sha@@ ded . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similarly to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ th .
rot@@ et@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film over@@ load with a red liner filter . this creates dramatic trends @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar yeast to day @-@ time . thus , similarly to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ate .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white footage with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones , while it adds a bit cold in the loop of a pressure and the re@@ development of an epi@@ ph@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your Grand@@ mother and thus similar to 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the translation came ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures in an image .
by adding a texture to your image , irrespective of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the thrust of an old master , a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or like a wall @-@ screen on a wall . the menu entry image texture apply to image processing can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the deep or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper textile effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frames can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photos is no easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ wn eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you provide the desired type of cream for your image . going through the picture with a thin line , Nie@@ p@@ ce around it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone @-@ shift and decorative brush adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : prints the width of the frame in percent . value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image combined with the box will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially when you cut off the tool after page ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any spot . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use text output , orientation , color out of the color pattern and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you &apos;ll just select a frame round the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is done .
any setting you choose for your text can change until you hit the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the checking out ; tool sten@@ cil , you can apply a sten@@ cil over one image .
the T@@ abl@@ one menu apply in image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils over one image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to the reduction of file size of the template ; just send an e @-@ mail in English to checking ; mail@@ ing@@ list came checking @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you must set your template folder with the &apos; root folder &apos; folder . select the folder in which you have copied the template folder . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root @-@ level has been set for the sten@@ cils , a sub@@ view reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ en@@ ord@@ ners . selecting a folder is updated the thumb@@ nail of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the picture shown in this button . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
down@@ sized : this button shr@@ inks the underlying picture . if you want to apply the mouse button on the whole image , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below to the template . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
ok , if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your image , then the image becomes automatic of the thumb@@ nail .
checking out ; poses three different tools to ac@@ ut@@ eness . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for cutting . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gran@@ ny images .
blur@@ redness mask works at the contrast of edges to make an image sharp@@ est . actually , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric per@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really enhances the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most of the digit@@ alized images need a correction to the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color together . this , in turn , results in a common color together . the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more ac@@ uation than normal cameras for private users .
with JP@@ EG images , a camera is often used internally . images in the raw @-@ format against it must always be p@@ iled up during processing .
some scanner already use a sharp@@ ness filter during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by raising a photo with the edge @-@ train system . this allows you to notify you with the menu entry .
you should keep careful but careful , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ est technique increases the edge of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the most useful technique to sharp@@ ens up a picture the tool re@@ focus . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ens up .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is considerably easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool to shape sof@@ tening with the menu entry , and experiment with settings . the window box on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help edit the image . this window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often create good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ redness mask too strongly , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will produce sharp in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a guns are affected by the filter . therefore , high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . therefore you should see pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image one of the original is added . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a frac@@ ture from the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable differential amount . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ alties are exemp@@ t and therefore better errors in faces , heavenly and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ ell@@ value = 0.@@ 0 .
the ship came ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyright protected filter -@@ algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to und@@ o an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused vo@@ icing ; in which it &apos;s a better approach than just trying to raise the picture . re@@ focus can usually start better results than blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus can usually start from the menu by calling on colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the source pixel , which depends far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; F@@ altung is influenced in most cases very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . it causes unwanted results .
circular focal length : this is the radius of circular f@@ ission . it is the main parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the standard value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , then it should be considered to be hal@@ ted .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help ar@@ te@@ facts . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
rob@@ atic filters : an increase in the drug filter can help you ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.@@ 1 is rarely helpful . if the drug filter is too low , &amp; eg . 0 is the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue the picture further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche shar@@ k . this is most commonly caused by a previously @-@ led thread . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal null , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the drugs filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ge size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for bull@@ ring depth or the gau@@ ze &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for that parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 .
the save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters that you have set will thus be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and intensity control on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible are perform , but leave behind unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you can read and comp@@ ress images , eg . as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than ac@@ ut@@ eness . this might thereby be caused to use the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood as ac@@ ut@@ eness .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the F@@ IR filter . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color pattern can be corrected . this picture has been made with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficiently light to auto @-@ focus lenses .
for more information on the methods of ac@@ amping correc@@ tions in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the Reg@@ ulators Tro@@ tte puts the blur@@ redness of the area of the dark @-@ dark , in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ts allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool inf@@ alli@@ bility is one of the most highly developed tool to remove the desired arti@@ facts with unparall@@ eled speed .
the algorithm has been developed by the image team of the REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the horse@@ power smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a little value leads to a equ@@ ated smoo@@ thing over the picture . wo@@ ing against larger values chie@@ fly homo@@ geneous regions and detail . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no shar@@ pen@@ alties are detri@@ mental . please note that the details of detail always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction Con@@ den@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes ev@@ enly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in a direction . if you have a film bas@@ kets or C@@ CD @-@ noise will produce a high value wav@@ y similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best eliminated in a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value fits perfectly to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is being smoo@@ ther , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be t@@ aller than 3 .
repeat : specify how often the algorithm is going through . typically , here is 1 or 2 .
Win@@ kel@@ step @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ hic alpha . if Alpha are chosen , it should also be small @-@ selected . so take care that small angles should create a long term of life . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral inter@@ acting ( 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ wide in pixels . you should bet the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low . he doubles its duration . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
the buttons store as well as loading accurately this . each setting of images can be fixed in a text file and be loaded later again .
imaging errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time with the button .
below you can look like pictures with small arti@@ facts corrected . the module will be applied in a photo that in Guatemala City with a an@@ alog@@ ous camera has been applied . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the checking came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ essen image quality . it uses a protected algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable images , to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens , remove . it can also be used to remove sensor @-@ noise from the camera or modem ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on Sens@@ or@@ rau@@ ds from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot shown above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensation . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully used with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings may remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can blur@@ red the image . the area mentioned through the radius is moving over the image and the color in it becomes smoo@@ thes and thus pur@@ ged minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focal point . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ t . if it increases , smoking is deleted . you may need to change the edges of the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter images cannot get more and smo@@ ked or lubric@@ ate once again .
edges : controls the edge @-@ precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the movie . if it can be too strong can not be removed the entire smoking or smoking . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a wi@@ ther smoking or JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or illumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color @-@ tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or illumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically are more con@@ stru@@ ed to increase . however , he also merge the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted when it is too high can occur . if it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur at the edges . he can remove sound tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used precisely for it . all parameters for noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loading .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this correc@@ te@@ d. the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes , a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to gau@@ ge the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to gau@@ ge . use tools for sof@@ tening with the menu entry , visu@@ alize and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ . the display window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the ship came ; Photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographs .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s sound , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sive and local errors that occurs in digital , original or subsequently digital images , which makes the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the algorithm is performed with a different tool , the image inf@@ user , executed . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the image team of the REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ist and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a loss of compres@@ sive Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ists , he generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct these problems .
the buttons store as well as loading accurately this . each setting of photo Rest@@ oration can be saved into a text file and can be loaded later .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ ine smokers . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film@@ makers on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and this correc@@ te@@ d. can be seen under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures can be reduced to an old colour photo , which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the menu came ; tool hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos that have to remove with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ ft .
light , t@@ ote or hot pixel are particularly suitable for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression through a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the assistant with the button Clear . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot water or light pixel through C@@ CD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark image to correc@@ ting the picture . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the assistant will notice the last dark @-@ picture and automatically re@@ charge this automatically during the next meeting .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all sectors .
select one area to see the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the movie . select then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pix@@ el@@ blocks . this is the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighbour pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 pixel block to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard method of the standard method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block to calculate a bi square square ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that will then be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be reached to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a screen@@ shot , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing . the original image was enlarged at 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the time checking , Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ bel@@ ated corners , an image .
fores@@ ight lenses , especially those in the middle and large photographic format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the whole sensory area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show conditions also this behavior .
it also has draw@@ backs . many center filter do need a factor 1.5 or 2 with Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter that it &apos;s impossible to keep the camera with hand . fores@@ ight lenses should also use with Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise the sharp@@ ness effects arise by movement .
with the great exposure of today &apos;s film and colour scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ents transformation on a blan@@ ket that is applied without this filter . the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ last@@ y tool uses the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three revisions , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery filter and with three additional re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of alter@@ nat@@ al absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.@@ 0 , which allows an optical filter with a bl@@ at@@ den@@ setting of 1 , or random@@ ly one light intensity of 2 , del@@ usion and reduce the density to a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous strength , contrast and g@@ amma @-@ settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels with these options . you only have to provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ eness of the exposure of the goal of the goal , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu selection ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ ation correction is applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast @-@ correction is also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the ship came ; Lin@@ ke@@ distorted is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion . color@@ less distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ der treats the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or revers@@ al form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar locking @-@ effect , fla@@ x but at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ dient is corrected the remote corners opposed to the second gra@@ der . if you combine these two each geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values , t@@ onal failure can be corrected and positive values are t@@ anned .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the engra@@ ver . this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter returns the reverse mark of the parameter General .
z@@ oom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in a correction first degree . negative values enlarge while positive the size dimin@@ ishes .
brigh@@ ten up : this value j@@ us@@ her brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion system is illustrated . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as default values .
the ton@@ n@@ or and ho@@ ver@@ ical correction should be performed in front of all inter@@ sec@@ ting or size changes . the best run this correction is to be all first through . if you perform a picture new and then do a ton@@ si@@ form correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it into an important place , such as the se@@ ater or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the t@@ onic / pad with the help of the lines .
if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ ical distor@@ tion , the resulting image black no@@ o@@ ks will have . you can remove them by cutting @-@ cutting tools in the menu of transformations from the image processing or the z@@ oom regul@@ ator of this dialogue .
for most pictures the tone @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like e.g. photographs from the front , frame and painting , it &apos;s the perspective so correct that all angles in the image are 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have an easy distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ous correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating inf@@ rar@@ ed film of g@@ imp@@ strap , which is accessible under this URL . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can preview the area for viewing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters set filming and film@@ makers ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller may change the amount of cinem@@ atic and dominance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter color channels for the reproduce of inf@@ rar@@ ed film mixed , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color formations are missing .
this is an example of inf@@ rar@@ ed cinem@@ atic effect applied to a landscap@@ ing from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a sort of au@@ ra in the hair@@ pin .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Filter film@@ makers is a simple to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the producers of large silver bas@@ kets of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
the cinem@@ atic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the control of the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the bodies . the standard value is , although frequent higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more kern@@ els , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the cinem@@ atic effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified version ( 2 ) . the original movie @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the ship came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the song came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature paintings and still@@ s are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ator to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush @-@ size between one and five out . thicker brush controls better for large images . smooth controls controlled the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side looked like , the sing@@ ul@@ arity .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and this has been marked with the ( 2 ) height . brush @-@ size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and M@@ DF 17 .
the recording came ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color @-@ and intensive gra@@ dient to create a carbon calculation . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dient is slowly change and therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline , that would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper equ@@ ator sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom end@@ owed the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ tte ) .
this is an example of the coal @-@ drawn filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adapting the intention value .
the checking came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was bl@@ acked in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the checking came ; Filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to re@@ vert your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , intense landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distor@@ ting effects . it uses protected algorithms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and lets it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wavel@@ ength , the image is distorted here with a different version of stain@@ s .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of dirt effects . it uses protected algorithms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom blur@@ redness : caught the image along star @-@ shaped lines that are going by a center . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al ignorance : caught the image by rotating the pixel around a center . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to come back to the background .
movement shar@@ pen@@ ed : caught the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft pla@@ que blur@@ redness : caught the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright notes . this is made photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny st@@ aking effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through random shift in the pixels and sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent in@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the paint @-@ swal@@ low in the picture and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel calculation using the button at any time .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright algorithm .
dro@@ plet size allows to change the size of the dro@@ p . as the dro@@ plet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish stocks changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
you can go with the checking ; image processing an area free from rain drops . use the tool to select the area , for example a face , which is to stay free . if you start to start the filter brack@@ et , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the fil@@ tered Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu of transformations and transformations .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a picture with a minimal loss of image quality .
to reduce a picture is simple . the big question is , how can you hold up an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information or gu@@ essing the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select shifting size in the menu and enter the destination values . the dialog is visible down .
the tool to change size does use a linear intervention method to push the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo shooting was developed by the image team of the REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are enumer@@ ated below :
maintained by the aspect ratio , when this setting is activated , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio is the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is being smoo@@ ther , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be t@@ aller than 3 .
the buttons are stored as and shop are used accurately . any recovery for photo can be saved as a text file and can be loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the original image ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enhancement to comparison .
cutting a photos is not only a frequently run @-@ run surgery , but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture . the image editing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and re@@ tract of the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then as you move the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will cut off the path . this gives you a good overview how your photo will look after cutting area . you can drag the size of the angle to cut down . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button &quot; button &quot; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file to store or save the file in the menu , to save the newly cut picture .
in the preview , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in dialogue will remain intact .
in the tool @-@ ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format it is always assigned to the greater value of height and in the cros@@ sover format .
the tool @-@ ratio to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use centi@@ meters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to automatically calculate the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in dialogue , you can place with the Max . ratio button to cutting the area to the maximum possible extent , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool @-@ ratio , cut its settings depending on the orientation tool ( horizontal direc@@ tional or vertical ) . if you use the inter@@ sec@@ ting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on your orientation . the modified dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF @-@ tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected the customized image and not the original image .
the settings of the merger control allow assistance to bl@@ ending , so that you can put your pictures better together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of similarity . like the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are able to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
Golden Center : the Golden center is a divi@@ ding down on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the blood @-@ blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who thus use your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times if you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is equal to the sum of their two numbers . the standing divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that this rule is followed as visually harmon@@ i@@ ously .
the golden middle provides fluid aid lines if you put a picture together . these help are enumer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party hed@@ geho@@ gs generates a liquid line of the eye can follow through the picture . this type of composition leads the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow on this way .
another rule is called the leg@@ gy of the golden spiral , also called Golden La@@ ecke . these spelling are used to attach the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . this can be simply being there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden triangles also head up from the top of the golden spiral . watch their ver@@ tex points are the mid@@ points of the pages of the golden area . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are no equivalent triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can be dynam@@ ically released .
when you use golden triangles to break up your frame create an effect of being called by professional photo@@ graphs dynamic symm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizontal direc@@ tional and flip labels can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic parts .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the auxili@@ ary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to turn an image at any angle .
if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image where things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the checking ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select trans@@ ference Free Rot@@ ation and adjust the destination angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button default you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the turn is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines . after you move it through an important point of the picture , you can fix it using a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ ut the angle as described in previous section .
after you turned out a picture you will find unwanted three @-@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is to use the function transform@@ ative de@@ cut from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atic mapping . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . please note the warning above .
all the spec@@ ulative transformations are conducted by a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialogue , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that have been created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle on the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transforming area .
angle on the right corner : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transforming area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area .
after the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ pleasantly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing .
the tool utility is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal resolution e.g. will dist@@ ort the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotating , the image becomes distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle becomes into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module through transform@@ ers .
decorate your image by using the horizontal corner and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you press on preference , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the thumb@@ nails .
your help becomes a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool utility to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the she@@ aring , the picture will be a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two gra@@ dations are producing twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after switching the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing .
checking came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iles were . in most distri@@ butions you &apos;ll be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; checking ;
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all available file formats on this site . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F under it .
if the extension came in the list , only files in formats are specified . if the extension is listed in the list , then the file extension comes from . you can edit this list of file exten@@ ders that have been checking and change . in the section configuration you can find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras even allow you to select the used format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; publication ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . thereby , redund@@ ant information reduces to save in this way the image data on a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JP@@ EG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save losses if this is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the Roh@@ ner format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very useful instructions in English . you can convert raw images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ on@@ verter of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; B .

many tools you need the photographic editing are included in checking ; included . your description will follow here .
all the imaging tools such as ac@@ ut@@ eness , soft sign , rou@@ gh@@ ing , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc . . use a single dialog type that is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . left of it allow five buttons to change the previous mode of view . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right displays the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected range .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top field shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected range .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the top field shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show super@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used may be adjusted in the common setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the picture and dropping in the part of the picture which you see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialogue is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar properties reveals the essential information about the selected image and it is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo@@ sets : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . you can drag it into a square . click C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker Maus@@ kno@@ b button to pull a square . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color labels and to choose and nam@@ ing colors .
the p@@ allets files , which are controlled by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and har@@ med colors .
in a dialog box , you can choose from a list of installed p@@ allets , or search the files to files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described beneath the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to generate such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse with an impressive lin@@ ker button .
if the cros@@ sover cursor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or translated into another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ written . in this mode you can set , by selecting the cross box under Con@@ cursor C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created just as described in the previous section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , as follows from a new@@ line sign , if another color is followed . if so , three numbers can be inserted in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;

&amp; graph@@ .@@ zip ; is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in inform@@ atics , so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graphic programs ; - programs with only a few features .
the &amp; graphic @-@ viewer : project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; programme .
&amp; Pat@@ tern ; is a KDE program for the viewing of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ .@@ graphic ; displays graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; successful ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in the graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graphs are re@@ comp@@ uted and displayed in &amp; graph@@ ed ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; Cou@@ graph@@ ed ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems of about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ ene is required .
the main window displays the opened graphics , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; graph@@ ing ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file opened and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more dot ; files select the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview will be displayed in the corner when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contex@@ tual menu or select this position automatically .
use the unic@@ ycle ( high and down without special prices , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has been changed in &amp; graph@@ ically ; loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore changes , so that later it will happen . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; see ... see also .
if you open a Graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic @-@ viewer , eg . in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , or who want to display the current instance in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the dialog dialog .
at the program launch , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs that are to go to a page . thereby , the aspect ratio is kept . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .

the site again charging gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , eg . by another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the page opening gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer , when a Grap@@ h is opened outside an ongoing meeting . you can define a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or determine in a window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site administration is provided with the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; graphic viewer . you can define a default behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) or determine at each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; will open up additional options :
here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ ene . it produces hierarch@@ ical or de@@ formed depic@@ tions of directed graph@@ ene . the algorithm puts edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ cutting cuts .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for odd graph@@ ene . it uses representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ table model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistics of multi @-@ dimension@@ ed sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for odd graph@@ ene a spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ite layout . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ clean gold , and contains a multi @-@ hand trigger for the treatment of large and exclusive graphics .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm shows the k@@ not circular shape according to the description of six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ cli@@ c structures .
open a dialog , where you can specify a Lay@@ out@@ command , which is then implemented by a shell . the command should specify graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i as parameters , and the comp@@ uted layout of the graph@@ ene to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout software , you can give special options , or also change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .

when you select the option of making the photos in front of the up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before the up@@ loading in the size . the size is drawn from which at maximal size registered .
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum amount of images . the size is changed so the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical locations allows GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image and edit . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to loc@@ alise images geograph@@ ically in sp@@ her@@ ical co @-@ operation system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tu@@ dinal are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can summar@@ ize a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alisation , you have to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data the same time in the same places as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic corro@@ bor@@ ated , which displays the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera system has to be re@@ funded with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ ation . lies the devi@@ ation under which the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference between 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ls and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating is located in a large period difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates are manually set with this dialog manually . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since dialogue is marked by calling one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and displayed with the shown map and enlarge . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the map can always be selected from card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ff to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alisation .
the tab is able to select four horse@@ men in which settings are to be adapted . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed in hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below the page will be displayed and the text that appear in the HTML Page will be displayed .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page is opened in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default figur@@ ator , eg . Ku@@ ick@@ show , appears
the rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . simply select a folder on which you have ra@@ vel . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ 5 , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures .
with other colors , you can change the standard color . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program@@ ing files to determine if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser is automatically finished in order to preview the preview of the gallery . press Sch@@ closing to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture material is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image asset , it enables Ih@@ msen to look into a selection of pictures and run on them base operations like rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with shor@@ ts and mouse @-@ bel@@ ated . it was developed for quick imaging and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss free module is a tool to change images without damaging your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual loss of quality and met@@ adata .
the consequence of the loss of loss of loss is that the file size is increasing , as no compression of colour information takes place . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client click is a tool to help you connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client client currently does not have documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function in the main program and then call on the import function . this then opens the file screen dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the data is copied after you have pushed the button OK .
this function does not work with all images . you can copy from anywhere , but not to write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide . everything in one go and in just a few easy steps .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ans can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module makes use of the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a basic screen . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background @-@ color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . after that , you can create over ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you selected are then enumer@@ ated in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the picture is displayed . a low value will be specified below . a low value creates a very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change .
the background @-@ color can be set next . in doubt you should put it in black . the name and the path of the created file can be set in the name of the MPEG output file . keep it as early as possible .
if you specify an audio file using the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can start drinking coffee or in all calm a coffee and enjoy the Sli@@ deshow . if you are back again .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ ans or tools is missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below .
the pressur@@ ised assistant allows multiple images to print on a sheet paper together in standard photo@@ sets . the combined images can also automatically be opened with image processing Gimp . this is e.g. use@@ fully to improve you or with the Gimp module to print directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your data stored in one of three formats of JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . everything in one go and in just a few easy steps .
conversion is based on the commands tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original type of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to create the same results as the software from your cam@@ ou@@ ters . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera preferences are to be used for the white @-@ off . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be j@@ acked . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect .
once you are sne@@ ak with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces for the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss of explosion @-@ free LZ@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you are planning to use your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JP@@ EG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata that are contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the EX@@ IF data in the JP@@ EG file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use abor@@ ting .
the batch @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . use this mode for example , if you are sure , for example by testing on a single picture which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if it &apos;s made in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can put the pre@@ fix , the star@@ tup and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the record .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it makes use of the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image below :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed by this option .
pressure preparation : prepare the image for photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images before . further pictures can drag on the list of pictures and disc@@ ard it there .
after you have started the module , the pictures are displayed window frames displayed by you . you can add additional pictures to the button in the button . for the last selected picture , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and put them there in order to add them to the list of ima@@ gery .
with the button images , the selected pictures from the list of the images are removed .
after you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window will open your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected have already attached .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the emails emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your email clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path in the input field , including the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your machine beforehand . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments on the pictures are merged into a text file and ser@@ ed the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu photos file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among los@@ s@@ free formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . therefore you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photographic quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend to you the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG under images and are the original text files in JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the ima@@ gery .
when the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status of the status of the status . however , your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button Sch@@ closing you can lie in this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions like you would like to have shown your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the pictures selected and all images of the album .
the config @-@ transi@@ tions in the presentation use very elegant image out@@ puts by using OpenGL . however , you need to possess a corresponding graph card since otherwise the Sli@@ deshow will be very slow .
the option to display fil@@ en@@ ames ensures that the dat@@ ast@@ ame of images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort it using Es@@ c .
the option images accidentally select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of images in the album .
lag between images can be set between images below . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should therefore check this before you present your friends presentation !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , if any change between images choose another effect .
during the Sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide .
at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ c has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the surface of the surface .
this module currently sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a backdrop for your KDE &apos;s surface .
once you have equipped your pictures and videos , you can use &amp; photo album ; through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , thus in people , places and in the group sections .
in the browser window check the categories for which you typ@@ ed information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look after EX@@ IF based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails will be described .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few individual images .
when you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can preview images to look at the images of your area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol before her name . you can save with &amp; photo album ; however , for each person to save your own look , this is of course also true for places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture here .
to display images in addition to the name , select the button , which you want to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . this has the advantage that you can choose for example symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate images for your keywords ) .
you must , however , define what image should be displayed for each individual . in order to view this , you &apos;ll have to display the picture @-@ in picture window , as shown in the picture . here you can select the picture for the respective person . in the guide window , you can adjust the del@@ im@@ ation factor according to your needs and thus select which part of the picture is to be displayed and / or dup@@ lic@@ ated .
if you call the entry to search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialogue for fixing the picture features . this dialog can be seen on the picture again .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of images are searched for this text . if you like , you can also type a date to search for , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , by pictures , on which Jes@@ per is not illustrated by Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the manual for &amp; photo album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try hand@@ books , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; photo album ; and check out the quick @-@ entry , the Screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; photo album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry . a demo can launch some sample pictures and you can try the features of &amp; photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as an integrated HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different periods . each list then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the leg only 10 @-@ minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries view from the database ( if you choose a date , the first image is displayed in the preview video ) and furthermore the tim@@ eline is always shown on the current date of the current picture when you navigate in the preview picture .
you can also select a area of the time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the Lin@@ e@@ al of the time @-@ line , so the tim@@ ings , drag . if you choose one area , you will be shown in the preview picture only images of this time@@ frame . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the time .
&amp; photo album ; introduces you two options available to create HTML pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; photo album ; in the following part of the user manual , the file format is described in &amp; photo@@ graphies ; integrated version described you can create about the HTML File menu .
before using HTML pages , you must make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following each area is described more accurately .
first enter the titles of the passage and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; photo album ; export file should be created to see on the review page . nutrient information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which can also be displayed without a description . for example , that all pictures are exported at party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain considerations .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are clear , so this is not made specific to this .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who look at your website and possess a monitor that will have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . therefore , it can search your pictures with lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission period . if he wants to get an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select all your HTML files is a root folder and a new sub@@ folder for every subsequent set .
first , you must select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location next time . you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all visible to the viewer . if you choose the root folder a URL , after the pages have been created , then this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files still haven &apos;t been in the final target folder , you need to copy it manually . so that the import function , see , properly functioning , you must specify the final target of the files , but the root folder in which all sub@@ folders .
the just setup options have been related to all three basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in this case , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you set in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; you might want to create a HTML @-@ page for viewing the images . if you already have a lot of time , the image information , persons on the pictures , reception , etc . step , then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work will not even go .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the de@@ co@@ ders are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ whether the images are stored in the file or if it &apos;s just a link to images in the file . the advantage all images are to be saved to the file and that you can pass that file independently . the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two ways . first , the pictures are found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files , this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by using the HTML export .
in the following the dialog for the export of images is described , which you can call via the File File menu .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available :
by selecting manu@@ el near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy , copy , the pictures are automatically created for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images are already compressed to JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not profitable to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , just select the option export file comp@@ ress .
the last option of this page is limited maximum size . if you send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by using , for example , that every image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file using the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , select &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in detail .
the wiz@@ ard to import imports consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you are person@@ able to person@@ alize the category people from the to imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called by your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories to import to the imported file and which categories they fit in your database .
in the fourth step , you can identify the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you view images , you often want to see images of your Italy @-@ package and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will pass through the different steps ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the through@@ going and prestige , to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for ste@@ aling your pictures . but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual will be talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; saves all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file at the top folder of their choice . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in CV@@ S where they like .
&amp; photo album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used at future starts automatically . if you like another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user guide you will explain the different settings options .
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can access settings , preview and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
you can also describe how you can set up different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals , or albums .
on display the dialog , which is used to already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories are already mentioned . in dialogue options you can set the complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , rather than explained all groups of a medium as explained in a group .
in view , you will find the setup options available to you . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you will find a list of the current category and list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; divide the module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can be called and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help @-@ page that you can access through the module itself .
since the modules used by several applications can be used together with each other , it may be that the modules are tested using the demo database before using them on your own pictures applicable &amp; photo album ; demo database , you can either call using the command line using the command &gt; photo@@ - demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help . don &apos;t tell , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules about K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , which allows it to be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order for albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
here we sim@@ ulate &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment .
next to the latest album , &amp; photo album ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you &apos;ve specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you are using the category people , you will do &amp; photo album ; so if you would have selected individuals to view this and pass on to the module .
because some modules are compatible with &amp; photo album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start to install dialog and select in the area module , which modules are supposed to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starter screen when you start &amp; photo album ; with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , see the menu above a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment you can &apos;t find much information about your pictures . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; G@@ ot album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for instance on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen have been recorded .
all of these notes may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see this notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; as you can use it again and again if you type information about your pictures .
the following idea is to push the images within the list : if for example you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find and locate people more quickly .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting on date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and put these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture right upstairs .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all situated in the US . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group of group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the package catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new section or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry in a category and put there in order to sort this one sub@@ category of this item . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you are having just your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this .
you can post@@ p@@ one the different elements of the package . by forming the list , the top @-@ edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by entering it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window in such a way that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button below ... , which features you the possibility to save up the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button below ... and then window will fade . see this process in the picture .
if you choose the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or any images in case you don &apos;t have a filter . you can check the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply changing the mouse with the middle mouse button . try to configure it easy .
when you get a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is furnished as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture @-@ picture . if you don &apos;t have a window opened with a picture @-@ picture , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture show . simply select the right images you would like to delete and select either the Dele@@ te button or select the Edit menu . now , the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; photo album ; namely , pictures can also use , without you saved on the hard drive . of course , you must have saved the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; photo album ; you can see the pictures anywhere else in the database . in the picture you can view the view from &amp; photo album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from your hard drive .
pictures , in which the right upper hand is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails will be displayed , so that &amp; photo album ; you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture viewing .
as you can see , this function requires that you can copy files back and copy files back into the folder . so , you don &apos;t support you to ask the filing of the respective CD . if you want to avoid any trouble , such as the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk in order to be able to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you want to block the images in the end of the menu . alternatively , you can also block all the images that your little sister can see , cont@@ oured , and block the menu @-@ on all besides current views .
to make you set out what images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you just choose the laptop with your little sister , just choose the menu entry images you have locked . if you want to get the images again , click on Sper@@ re up@@ lift .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered into the image of the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means absolutely sure . at the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other hand anyone can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection serves only for those who are familiar with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images .
the reason you are looking for all of your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and / hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo album ; via an image _ and Video@@ viewing . you can preview how described in .
you can see the viewer in view . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can draw it with the mouse and drop them elsewhere . you can also configure the information displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click menu . you can see the short@@ listed menu button below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click on the browser , see the appropriate entries on this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have downloaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slide . &amp; photo album ; then loads a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can load a new picture by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus as well as minus . and stopped and stopped by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of the spect@@ ator of &amp; photo album ; is it in full @-@ screen mode to change . in this mode , the viewer is using a complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can get into the image and get out into the image . with the minus button you can get back r@@ out the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your oom , so that the image is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the same key it uses the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel is equivalent to the screen to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that are in and feature zo@@ oming with the plus and m@@ inu@@ key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item note from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the viewing dialog dialog &apos;s image to submit this name . you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you see one by one .
for the two examples above the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide pictures with features , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in a picture , you can see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have features your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have any pictures that you edit , print or whatever selected , so you can easily use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or what ever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the view view . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview , then you can add characteristics to the images by pressing the letter for the characteristic after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . in this case allows you &amp; photo album ; to paint on the picture .
the painted is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your old later .
you can see an image on the bottom of the painting . to switch the painting mode from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply hit the cross in the tool@@ bar on top of the window .
to work with &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not entirely control , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood absolutely .
in the object tree , you can choose single objects . then their properties are shown in the properties tab and the object displays yellow @-@ yellow views .
you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object of a selected object , since all sub@@ commands are already selected with the object .
to add a new object to the object tree , choose the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following listing menu is listing , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar below Edit or from the right @-@ click menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have altered attributes , click App@@ lic@@ able to apply these changes . if you typ@@ ed invali@@ d values , a message will be shown with a error description . then you can correct the input errors and re @-@ adjust the changes with abor@@ tions .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the dialog dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the illustrated object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in your own view .
press preview in your own view and a small example of the scene is minim@@ ized with the selected texture , even if you want to have selected a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cru@@ ising locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and it will appear a small cross in the Dra@@ wing model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the location for shifts . you can change the shift through drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window .
every object as a wire model has a Visi@@ bility level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level of small or equal the Visi@@ bility level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window assignment as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the lens properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the default content order , or if you need any other arrangement , you can adjust it to any number . you can also save multiple window frames and simply switch between different assignments .
to anchor a window on or below one available view , pull the starter at the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , pull the starter on the right hand or left side of a view . the new view is anchored to the right hand or left side of the view and extends beyond the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over the other , drag the starter in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views via clicking on the mapping fix@@ tures on top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views which are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click the small to the left above shown arrow in the fas@@ zination bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the main@@ board . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert extra views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them on any spot .
the current window view can save you with view window frames ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can store the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 @-@ currently . this version is stored in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders The icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene ren@@ ders .
a ro@@ cking mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of pensions modes , from a fast preview to full @-@ pictures in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog open :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , useful is a name that lets the characteristics of the mode .
in the map card size you can insert the width and height of the framed picture . if you only want to train a small area of the picture , select the cros@@ sover section and enter the section section for rendering into the input fields .
in the quality field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders use . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user re@@ flexi@@ ve illum@@ ination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s manual and Po@@ v@@ ray ;
when a picture is transported by only a ray of pixels , different errors can be created . these pictures often have a mo@@ an air pattern or mar@@ sh effects in curves and lines , plus sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature better look better .
when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray on pixels . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of Super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is constantly divided into and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion projection depends on the calculated colour .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray depending on pixels . if you set the difference between color@@ ations to the neighboring pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth level on 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays according to pixels .
the difference between two pixel will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays according to pixels . if the difference between the color values exceeds the above @-@ given threshold , the pixels will be followed individually and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of smokers for the ray process , called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn out J@@ it@@ tering , modified &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ment is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which diff@@ use diff@@ use of light reflection . it takes a very long time to let a scene calculate with this property .
on this map , you can set whether the Alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel will be transparent if the associated beams does not have an object .
open a new window to display the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently support &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not the complete command @-@ reach of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if in case of import error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all the messages .
if you do not support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Be@@ gin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the code text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object to the created text file in the editor , just highlight the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also to insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene removes . usually , this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
click on the Help in Fe@@ atur@@ a view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . imagine the path to your document and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example h@@ ri@@ dd@@ ling ) into the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you are incorpor@@ ating files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the windows type characteristic .
you can set the object catch of the points on the R@@ aster in the context menu of the Dra@@ wing model Vie@@ ws . you can set the R@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ ali@@ zations and rotation .
bigger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail time for two directions .
when you cross High Status Credits for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire model is further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to start rendering .
when you show a wall , a wall is rounded behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you display floor , a floor is rounded below the objects . the soil is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the edge of edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the section of R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify existing window frames or create new window frames . in the section window , it explains how to create and store window frames .
the Com@@ bin@@ ational element Standard @-@ window App@@ endi@@ x : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window assignment at the start of the program .
the list of existing windows of windows shows all available window frames . a new arrangement can delete you with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window @-@ assignment is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below names reveals all views of the chosen shell order . new views can delete you with the button and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with which you anchor a mapping view in common with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just got &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and now you would like to start out without precise knowledge of the two programs . if you want to follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate yet simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that , as a result you can only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t fit light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you will receive only one black image .
if you have all the error @-@ free installed , you can see at the first Start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following pre@@ viewed windows order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so you can get a proper idea of what you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols must now be used frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you create . in particular , you notice it in the fourth dragon model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ment of the scene .
the object tree now includes a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera can change in View Points , with which you can change the camera item on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the button application or input key , the wire model element and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could for example insert a qu@@ ader for example ( inser@@ ting En@@ ges body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehensible method to solve this task .
&amp; K@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; offers really a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : choose the plain in the object tree , change the name and then push the button application or input key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the level even if at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can select the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object .
in this scene , you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to practice a unit under the horizon line , just so you get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as below :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select at the moment something simple .
in both cases a dialog , in which you can select how to paste the object . you can change the name in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment displays only a mat@@ ured black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always check the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities now , but you are now the easiest .
if you don &apos;t see color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button &apos; button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is set right now . if you are reading your picture with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following results :
of course , that is not the color you have expected . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess@@ board Color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree je@@ des@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
this step should be easily executed , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; they have already understood the ball as simple as the ground :
in the view of the properties tab you can immediately change the settings . place the value for the radius : at 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button application ) , so the ball has ho@@ vering over the ground as you have moved the ground to a unit down .
off course , the rendering is now a strange result : as you can see earlier , the ball @-@ surface appears as a mat@@ ured black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can assign a material now . as already on the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in the ball @-@ pig@@ ment . click on the ball @-@ pig@@ ment , select then mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and set the values as below :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or push the input bar .
the configuration shine @-@ effect and Refle@@ ction are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ lov is a pensions method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you trac@@ er a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ings , the ren@@ derer consists of the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which prevents the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the ro@@ cking is calculated on how to impact the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog could affect . so the scene pixels being edited for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see a camera nothing , the camera is your eye , with which you look the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene , which is to be cur@@ ated , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
always , when you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu , replacing the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already stored the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
introduces the scene over the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage are being dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only select if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeated the last und@@ one command repeated this menu . you can only select this menu if you have used editing .
saves the current window and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change with this option to change &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands change or add new ones .
open a dialog to establish machine tools . you can add and remove tool@@ sets for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pre @-@ stain surfaces , without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etric form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geom@@ etric shapes you can use as components : very complex 3D models are produced by dozens , or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base , using a picture file as a color card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application is a comfortable image asset and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose images to display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can return with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Send Return .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the file window in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right @-@ hand corner . if a password file has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue - &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cartridges . in three of them , General and editing , and slideshow , you can adjust the working method of &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands to display and short rest for the browser , the short@@ cut can be defined for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images are displayed in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad @-@ type is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
is this point activated , invites &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; in the ending the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens and sp@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bars to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window , the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can show &amp; det@@ ach ; thus , that only some of the file types are displayed , which the program can represent also .
with this option for big images the display window will be enlarged on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
determine if the slideshow with the first image should start in the folder or with the selected image .
the time lap@@ se between the image changes in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the amount of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
click here the short@@ cut @-@ abbrevi@@ ation for the different operating modes of &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; in the mapping modules short commands for the display window and shor@@ eline for the browser .
with this option , you turn off between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the partial view of the file system with folders and files in a window around .
shows great symbols for the files in the folder . this display can only be displayed in the short display .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only available in the short display .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only available in the short display .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
by increasing the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open more .
display the image in its original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of each file you &apos;re looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ y photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on checking out ; image processing . &amp; show@@ y ; is part of the ship came ; project .
&amp; show@@ y photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ y ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to a minimum of problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ y photo , it lets you report as easy as possible errors or potential improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser opens a page to reports about problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ y photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ y ; join this mailing list , and hopefully soon answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is mentioned , you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ y ; it is the developer mailing list to join . guidance to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ y ; .
&amp; show@@ y sketch ; try to give you much control of its work@@ flows as possible . to access to these settings , you have to set up in the menu settings show@@ y . you can switch between these settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ load indicator of the indicator would be selected . skill modes should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . shelter should display a bright color and over@@ lap a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ y photo , has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar , you can also see it in the image editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five horse@@ men :
&amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ ating l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and storing images , which no longer makes a dialog to save and save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display images before downloading .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner at the SAN@@ E @-@ Project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a default scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; using the command @-@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog is opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the used scanner and push OK to open the scanner . cancel and stop it .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options particularly .
to can@@ al@@ locate an image , the user can only start a pre@@ f@@ can and then scan for the final scan . the preview is started by the preview button .
to select the image better , the user can get in the image and get out of the current selection out . he can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview is fitting in the window .
if the image was selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if pre @-@ saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview display , as shown below . if saved is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
through the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can look the picture if desired to be displayed in front of save . in this case the option before storing a preview is selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option has to be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ in@@ ite ; images saves . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each transm@@ ited image . if &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically has to be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must be saved without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option save without after a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for the dialog to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . this automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time being updated when a picture is stored . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
the user can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if you choose the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button aid starts the KDE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ id ; manual . the button About starts the KDE Trans@@ action for &amp; sk@@ id ; . the button settings indicates the dialog for setting and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ ating ; to finish .

&amp; Amar@@ ok , used like all other programs of keyboard short@@ cut . below you will find a list of these short@@ cut and its function . the global short@@ cut , you can set up by right mouse button in the player window and set glob@@ als short@@ cut , by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select commands ... select ...
you may create existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; this will make your keyboard on the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly seen in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions from collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP &apos;s break could be a break :
Amar@@ ok supports the lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed on account of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use dialog , so that the user doesn &apos;t run .
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; Post@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or just extend it to the necessary functions . you will quickly realize that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ K and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should be attached .
most scripts allow the em@@ bit@@ ing of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy can be called . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , strings to monitor their standard input will be monitored constantly and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to display the dialog dialog . to save the store and loading of the furnishings , each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the job folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now play &amp; num@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions , you can ask further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the len@@ ght @-@ length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an inte@@ ger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu Open@@ ing P@@ AT@@ H@@ s contains the path to select the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . to remove an entry , one can remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ ized ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok , it is finished , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) that can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive names such as Amar@@ o@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right .
the main script should be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining written modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can easily drag music to the playlist instead of going through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting &apos;s browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . furthermore , lots of different audio systems can be used , so EV@@ ER can be able to hear your music . this and yet many more useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !
usually , one must enter the basic folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok and install :
because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have in the compiled no trouble . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; as most applications , it has some options to enable or disable a comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details of this can be found in the system requirement .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gger icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort on the dialog dialog . the dialog dialog has several mapping maps for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
player @-@ Window gives you the player window in addition to the playlist , or out . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists windows are displayed .
mood bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option spl@@ its the experimental function of the m@@ apper bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme for the m@@ bar@@ ometer is changed .
mood files to take place in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . otherwise , the .@@ new@@ files are stored in the location of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ new@@ files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : let you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok will be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not in the list above .
save the playlist , save the current playlist automatically at the Be@@ enden von &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you would not want to lose the running playlist if you want to lose .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the playlist of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored .
you can see the updates visible in piece changes , that the play@@ lists window opened - / rol@@ rolls to keep the current piece always in the visible window range .
when changing the context @-@ browser automatically switching the context @-@ browser to change once the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the section image , you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the layout is custom@@ is@@ able . the section is divided into three parts .
in the paper section , you can use the use of different writings in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by flag@@ ging of own scripts , the otherwise gray image is activated . you can select writings for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . press to select ... so you can choose a preferred font in the selection dialog .
with selecting user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the option of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the above @-@ activated color selection for front and background color .
playing at the start brings that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the play@@ back automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it stopped at the last ending .
the sub @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to disable the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross @-@ field shadow causes the text in OS@@ D sha@@ ded .
own colors use gives you the opportunity to adjust the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog to suit choice . if desired colours do not use enabled , the presented &amp; cold colours will be used .
the display device displays the text shown in the OS@@ D . by entering horiz@@ ons , the OS@@ D can be customized to meet your needs . below you will find a list of the available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen screen is meant for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to define on which screen a multi @-@ speed monitor environment the OS@@ D should appear .
the mapping card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this mapping .
the mapping collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search a folder in the collection , select the crossing field next to his name . this section also contains sei@@ z@@ apping fields to setup , as should be performed with the selected ordin@@ ators .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively search : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music .
make changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , a incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists are added to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ and@@ .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part of the payment database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations@@ Field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , further establishment is necessary in the My@@ S@@ ql establishment .
the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ device is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under computer , the machine is typ@@ ed on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered . subsequently , under port , the network port is entered , under which the database is achie@@ vable . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established .
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the carto@@ ons last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok , can transmit the names of pieces to a load @-@ load server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m page .
send drama pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activ@@ ating this attitude will call &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters on the same play . note : you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a load @-@ load profile to be able to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio @-@ player for Unix systems ( like &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the features and gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package K@@ delicate and otherwise no more KDE @-@ packages . you need to have K@@ haz@@ bs therefore installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; require some of them in order for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , such as K@@ deli@@ bs are minimal .
some features such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . therefore , flu@@ x@@ box will support some difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these are providing an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can view the file by clicking into ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log and also attach the cap@@ ut@@ te file that has caused the crash . then you can delete the file and make the collection again .
most of the fact is that Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes into reading the Met@@ a info from this file . please report this error to the conference Li@@ b developers under bu@@ b@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok , with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , this leads to t@@ opp@@ le when editing the Met@@ a information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , you disable automatic . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the adjustment of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many of the program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 can write to met@@ a info , but they do not mark it as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; exists not &quot; unless - f &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( inf@@ use mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) you will see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can easily find the status De@@ activated on Grau and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a icon for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check out if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clarify most ligh@@ test through the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ worthy .net on the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please make a mistake there if something is located at the re@@ me@@ dying of a error in Amar@@ ok .
after starting off &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears just a blank playlist . how do you get there music pieces ?
that is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window has been converted into the statistics window . you can find it under ex@@ tras .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate the pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column for viewing . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ et@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from playlist , remove from the folding menu .
drag a playlist of the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do it with other files too . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar , the playlist , right next to the add button , is in the button playlist . click on it .
probably you will find the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for li@@ b@@ inger , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras .
none . yes , that is really ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every conceivable audio format . G@@ host@@ amer can even support text and p@@ NG !
it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not use any MP3 @-@ de@@ or mit@@ ones ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , Invent@@ ory
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
the device has to use a bl@@ ender device with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously audio ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ host@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ an ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media will first have to be de@@ coded . G@@ spre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ cor with little over@@ head . G@@ spread reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to al@@ sa . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can directly spend al@@ sa , just as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ host@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( alert , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . ensure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound @-@ buff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa @-@ furnis@@ hing file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ ein@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia fully to obtain the quicker Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b ) so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less jobs respond to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing multi@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ stretching FAQ . if that fails , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer FAQ .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download your ff@@ m@@ peg to compile and install it . then run G@@ ST register , once a system manager and once your regular user . delete then in the module folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magical ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP , it is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let it perform with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run it . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok will run before going to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the gentle sounds of the music you have stopped prior to bed .
how to find the current one in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ongoing titles ? if one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : ssh @-@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ use Amar@@ ok @-@ player Play@@ ing
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be sealed off . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size res@@ ectable window .
the combination of str@@ g + rights mouse button puts a piece in the click of queue in the queue . by pressing the input bar after a search in the playlist , the first search results is played and the search is reset .
ok , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control panel ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ MB@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console , many error messages appear .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
set the CD , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens in the wa@@ v file , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired target folder in a trans@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , you instead transfer files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , the F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can add the review for a piece of yourself by clicking on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then select evaluation . then you can click the review of one piece in the play@@ lists and click on Edi@@ ting : evaluation or F@@ 2 press . you can also edit the rating in the dialog Met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means that KDE packages have a fixed publishing plan that does not bring together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can quite also find annoying . disable the option icon when playing anim@@ ating in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create an own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation systems allows you to browse and control of Amar@@ o@@ K ; while you browse Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select in the folding menu &apos; Add Amar@@ ok .
audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that can be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free us@@ ername and a password . audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use Al@@ sa , please check the latest version . old Al@@ sa releases have a lot of ab@@ duc@@ ts and thus also caused a lot of error messages .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok was compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine this output modules did not compile . you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you may use a distribution , which is the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed separately from the actual program . the same is true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine de@@ vel @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you have to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok ; again re@@ compile and install again .
I consider the mistake G@@ unter @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ host@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ays , which is incompatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile g@@ im@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ ing . a tip of Merlin T@@ TC : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you will compile Amar@@ o@@ K .
I consider the message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad installed .
to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with go@@ amer , you have to be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer quick@@ time .
you will receive the fault There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system manager G@@ ST register . then run Amar@@ ok new .
I have a second sound@@ card and use al@@ sa . how can with Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok set up ... audio output give you the device one . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with one on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ smart 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug ) d@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ect@@ l@@ .@@ smar@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type 2 d@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ect@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter in the dialog dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual mix device , you can disable the tick on sound@@ card .
we are sorry , but the audio edition with Arts is not further taken care of . you may naturally like to take this problem in your hand ! if you want , you can get the new so much needed counsel@@ ing for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the ordering assistant , who is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection easily , then this quick start @-@ guide will be helpful . with their help , you &amp; Amar@@ ok will have set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag the playlist to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection facilit@@ ates you the search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist . if the playlist is selected in the folder of your collection , you can select the option to import play@@ lists . with a right @-@ click on a playlist you will receive various options , such as the playlist should be loaded .
to play an audio CD , select operations audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD @-@ holes in the W@@ AV format . drag the W@@ AV files into the playlist and then push the button play .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . simply click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . here you have different possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . also , some additional packages are listed , making the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( eg R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as every normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browser which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
in this chapter explains how all the functions of Amar@@ o@@ ok will be used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a tre@@ et@@ aker showing the currently running piece or the current running stream . right below is the area , the game time , bit@@ rate and sample ads of the current piece . a click on this field changes the display of the already exp@@ ired player &apos;s time to the remaining season of the piece .
also , the player window lists a selection of audio analysts , also under the run @-@ text display . you can change through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the field .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . pressing d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the buttons also contains the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activated the play@@ lists windows , while the button E@@ Q is used for setting up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play@@ back buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slide . use the sli@@ der to adjust the piece position or volume . with the play@@ buttons , you can start play@@ back / stop and move to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preference .
to display the E@@ quali@@ zer display ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the button E@@ Q in the player window . once you highlight the announ@@ cing field E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that there are in no other player . however , do not be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be split into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation system . in the navigation section , you find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand is the playlist yourself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows are later added into the details .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might have noticed that the sub @-@ window will be dropped . the information presented here are now displayed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , information can be collected in the statistical window ( ex@@ tras ) .
the sub @-@ window music shows information about the straight @-@ running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this symbol to copy the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its assessment .
to view cover pictures in the context @-@ browser , the cover pictures are supported in the same folder as the current piece . the context browser may have any names but pictures with the word front in name are treated prefer@@ entially . the context @-@ browser will also display cover pictures that have either been downloaded with the cover administration , or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area displays the top five best pieces of the actual interpreter .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music window . click with the right button of the mouse , anywhere in the window window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpreter present you in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the contents of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to immediately start playing playing . you can also click on the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text written from other web sites . once you click on the text window , Amar@@ o@@ ok is tried to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which to be started .
the button Edit lets you edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . in addition , no run text script is needed .
the button Find opens a search for google.com after the text @-@ text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing performer - group only the top level , each piece will be shown directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are never ignored .
group@@ ing performer - First will be sorted the pieces according to performer . if you want to see connections or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group interpreter / year - album - Sor@@ ted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first to genre and beneath them by interpreter .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works as well as the above , but still sorted by the album below the interpreter below .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing entirely to Bel@@ i@@ eben .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically track your collection once you have something about the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar , a search filter is located . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the construction view . notes for using this fil@@ ters can be found in the section about the playlist in this hand@@ book .
under the search filter there is a selection field , using its help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose different tim@@ es@@ ake , from the last 24 hours to a year . of course you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
through clicking with the right mouse button , click on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
download - This le@@ dges the current playlist and includes the selected items in the currently valid order in writing .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you can reach the same effect .
setting pieces in queue - this feature fits the selected pieces into queue a . this allows you to play next .
as a playlist ... - save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name where the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transmission to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn CD - Dad@@ gar releases the selected pieces on K@@ 3@@ b and burned down either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not display .
met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or several pieces .
( n ) files in the du@@ st@@ bin ... - opens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as compilation highlight - Select the chosen album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it to appear under different interpre@@ ters .
sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis up - changes a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer appear under different interpre@@ ters but once again under the interpreter as interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser is designed to interact with a lot of play@@ lists . among other things he also contains Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart playlist . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful playlist to run the term . smart play@@ lists are made up of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even personally , Intel@@ ligent Play@@ ists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new intelligent playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of Amar@@ o@@ K ; with your portable media player ( eg . iPod ) , it must be integrated in front of the start of Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok is started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpreter sorted in the top list of the Media Player Brow@@ sers .
to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list . therefore , the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . if the transfer is complete , end you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and redeem the cra@@ fting for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you can find a search area where you can search for a file . the search is useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all the files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar that allows you to pick music from a per@@ tin@@ ent URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can enter music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop it .
if the playlist is longer than in the window place , the hanging files can be helpful through simple folding . in this case , the susp@@ icious of Shift key may be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the Mau@@ r@@ base .
the playlist en@@ vy all of you to play . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries in the mouse into the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter , push the back bar until the text field is left again .
if you enter through spaces separate search terms , Amar@@ ok will contain Amar@@ ok ; for entries that contain all the search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you search between the search terms and searches for entries , which either contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , contain the spaces , then add the search term with you : Mike Old@@ field . this will come for entries looking for Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search engine , you can also look for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces that have higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces , which does not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ onymous variation in Bel@@ i@@ eben . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher score as 50 and do not include the comment .
you can set the play@@ back sequence of entries by holding the Str@@ ong button , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . then the entries are then issued with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played back .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will add the button , with which you can add the playlist pieces . to the right next door you can save the playlist , empty , and coinci@@ dental .
next , the buttons are following back@@ ups and re @-@ manufacture . this allows you to re@@ vert or re@@ vert changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar , a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration .
there are still many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example re@@ output checks and volume controls . you can set the buttons , by clicking on the menu and to set mould making .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the play@@ time of all the pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and re @-@ grab is displayed simply by clicking with the mouse twice in the relevant display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , you can disable the status of the status bar in the general settings .
the context menu will reach you by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . through this menu , you can reach the settings of Amar@@ ok .
one click on this entry opens the window of visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok .
the cover @-@ management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions of covers in the collection browser .
the cover @-@ administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose what to appear in the cover administration . select from :
the waiting period received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , appears in the playlist a number next to the title . this number represents the order in the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will first play , 2 as a second , and so on .
if you want to add a queue for the maintenance of the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces in the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then change in the queue .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details of the establishment of these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your whole collection and adds further random pieces while playing more random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . they do not need a load @-@ load profile to make this dynamic playlist .
just click on the desired playlist , drag them into the play@@ lists window , or click the right button . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist , in certain circumstances ! with the
the two featured modes of random mix and play@@ lists simply fill your playlist and you can add the play@@ lists directly . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece of yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will each be added to the next piece of piece , so your playlist won &apos;t be filled until the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep track of the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings of dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the new button inv@@ aded the current playlist and add new stuff according to dynamic mode . playlist edit the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist you have the possibility to click Edit . accordingly , the dialog to edit the settings of the playlist .
insert any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this attitude is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be passed over , and they will not be heard in this playlist , but if the setting is active , the pieces are already taking into consideration of hiring different pieces .
split pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist won continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of dialogue you can cross existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , the Amar@@ ok will be included , random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts , by clicking on the script . after you install the script , a new entry is displayed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . please use the added scripts to install the script .
if you do not want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . simply select the script to un@@ install script then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see the writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations &amp; Amar@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross @-@ box next to the name .
this quick instructions will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to re@@ trace the steps , you have to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder of audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check whether an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog window you can &apos;t do anything . please wait , until the calcul@@ ator finished the combustion process .
this quick instructions will show you how to copy &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to re@@ trace the steps , you have to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and you have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
for copying of a data CD , please select ex@@ tras , copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings on burning .
after you have made all the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog of the way or something like that :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the head start . once the reading of the original is locked into the image file , you are asked for an empty CD medium upon which the data is burnt .

if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burns all the types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all the functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; used automatically &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning of CDs . in some cases &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality at burned audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc digital audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio coding . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - und Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio @-@ Dec@@ or . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( eg MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source code for loss of audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio Encoder module , so you can read and write F@@ LA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ IC@@ C , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ pack decoder : additional libraries on the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ code WMA files to inc@@ .@@ de@@ co a audio CD .
So@@ x : a relief program that can convert between different audio formats - and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video review . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the function@@ ally fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example to create mixed CD &apos;s and MP3 collections . without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the pieces of music can be reproduced .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically re@@ play all videos on the CD folder .
this is a convenient way , recently opened projects to load again . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file previously created will be over@@ written , otherwise asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed where you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would be saved for each project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet been stored , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; upon what has to happen . you can then choose between storing and changes . in addition , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project saved , which should be done so as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each project not stored project will be asked what should be done so as if you were called the file .
when you call this entry , you can select about the upcoming dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the upper view into the project &apos;s view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added to the base sub@@ folder of the CD .
open the &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened when the project has already been stored data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can do a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different potential settings , most of which are about the What is it ? help ( at@@ tainable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you combine files for a multi conference session . the data of the previous meeting are always involved , even if this feature is not used . it is thought for you as help , so that you can already see the files that are already available on the medium .
this entry appears only with active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature arran@@ ges &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . this function removes not files from the medium , they fade only the imported files once again .
open the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows you to create a CD from a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only want to create an image from a CD , which you can then eventually burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD @-@ copying dialog . alternatively , without project file the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only burn one image of a DVD , which will then be able to burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of the copying dialogue is not yet supported , hence the target medium must be big enough to record the whole ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to form a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to write the choice between the typ@@ ho@@ i and incre@@ mentally .
burns a previous CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file burned down as a data source , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously released DVD @-@ Video can be converted . thereby , this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used single @-@ standing video , code settings , and even ways to change the size and to cut black edges .
displays information about the occasional medium . this information is represented in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small list is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switch off the folder view , or off . the folder view includes an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the thumb@@ nail is enabled , their content is displayed in the corner view . CD / DVD drives also have a short@@ cut menu with functions such as media info , locks , and locks of the running or throw of the medium .
unlock the table view , or off . the view view allows selecting and pulling files into the proj@@ ector . the view view is also the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the p@@ iste into the project view , or out . the copying list is a narro@@ wer section that contains only visible when the proj@@ ector has open projects . the copying list has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ector clear from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog window to change key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has selected one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the scanning area to it further down .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; Con@@ figuration Assistant . this allows the correct enti@@ t@@ lements for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system manager rights need to enter , therefore , you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) when starting the assistant .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in this case , general programs may be made . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should be in touch . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and for the dist@@ res@@ sing of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; D ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ Interface is equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled using a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the function@@ alities , therefore it &apos;s more of your taste and the type of your task is crucial to what the accompanying program you give you .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use the functions , you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions which have all the &amp; k@@ de ; in common , support &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD , and other functions to provide new projects .
D@@ COP@@ re@@ ate@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ fr@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ fr@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ fr@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ ase C@@ dr@@ w ( ) E@@ COP@@ re@@ ase C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void @-@ format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void , D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X method one receives a D@@ COP reference to the newly generated project : D@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will be obtained via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface as well as the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ Name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT Brow@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT Cream / home / tru@@ win / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; - Cre@@ ators for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder of the machine .
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD files on the hard drive ) and by many co@@ ders that these W@@ AV files are coded ( compressed ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD are being read out and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss of F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ ums is already installed ( for .@@ GG ) or other codi@@ les . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions available , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , if for example F@@ LA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which stove / file format is to be used ? the Chapter cat@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ans is a small introduction of enco@@ ders , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware version of the &amp; CD ; / DVD tools can handle the protection , it is not possible to byp@@ ass a protected audio CD . simply avoid buying the copying audio CD ; simply avoid the purchase of Cop@@ y Audio CD ; s !
while the setup has to be made only once ( the dialog dialog ) can be called so often up to a suitable configuration ) , afterwards the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to an understanding of the slim character of the user interface , which you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB will get from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually captured .
this is just a brief list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the establishment of your request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet . )
starts the read and - if a Encoder was configured in the code settings tab in the ordering party - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder to allow the selection to be read with another Encoder as the default . it is noted that previously the Encoder is configured in the dialog box in the dialog dialog dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already downloaded file will be selected rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the dialog dialog to determine the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as interpre@@ ting the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main use dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different mapping maps ( like Encoder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes tape quality , co@@ ders , and compression rate and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is to go lost is a loss @-@ free audio format required . besides F@@ LA@@ C it is also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial equipment that can reproduce the files .
under the audio formats , the information obtained through data comp@@ osing depending on their psycho@@ acou@@ sti@@ cal model are MP3 and O@@ GG . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will be less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless delivered with most distri@@ butions available free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with deeper bitter@@ ness .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based computer system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG covers are available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially - these devices are often only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer outstanding transparency for most people and most of the pieces of music , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
--@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos;@@ = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
--@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of juven@@ iles , portable devices and car stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which is manually entered or generated by the software automatically from the free@@ DB Explorer , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be handed over / used using &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the codi@@ fication program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the Ko@@ di@@ ans and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; col@@ ap@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing of the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which individuals can download the audio CD , so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it &apos;s to note that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes it should be legal , but I ( if the author concerned ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more information available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less so neither the artist nor the music can be damaged . all information may be obtained with a bum@@ ble@@ bee by one &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtually .
in &amp; Cou@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively a cross @-@ box use ( Send an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This may be only the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use free@@ DB , the geographical store will be used for the next mirror servers . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for the online range of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates to the database .
which outlet is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that this cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; anyone who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to be aware that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet happened .
for saving the exu@@ ber@@ ated W@@ AV files the co@@ ders and therefore the desired file format can be chosen . during the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss of code for audio data ) on the tab to setup the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the codi@@ fier package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution , before the coding can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ ders . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ans are located in Chapter Ju@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ans .
after installing a stove , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a counter window ( eg . console ) . in doing so , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the spelling and reading files of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might give an indication of what &apos;s wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete hand@@ book , everything understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame may be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ amed it on it ( eg you try to copy it into the trans@@ quer@@ or bit ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for any tap@@ ing &amp; CD .
here we determine the used co @-@ coding for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the file format . since we are lazy we share the program using the free@@ DB to use the &amp; CD to download data from the Internet .
although we can always change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it with each reading a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device designation will be handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; files / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , the effective tool designation may be specified too . if on the drive with other programs can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ lin@@ t and an attempt with the existing entries of equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the mapping of universal settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be shown as entered / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only When un@@ available information can be asked , so that you will be informed if information about the detection of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the mapping card CD ; just select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD data automatically via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately by reading the &amp; CD ; which is later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting fil@@ es@@ name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be easily changed using Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; D ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , further notice : if you want to enter everything manually , you disable the selection units and free@@ DB is not used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice if this is worth it . to be chosen free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two selection fields have to be selected at least the first . the mode is set up in the following mapping .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data @-@ inquiry , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data is to be given the CD ? read the section on free@@ DB . put all the way it is shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look back for a mirror server nearby . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , since however many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be delivered . the first notion of application should be de@@ vised .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously ex@@ iting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one simultaneously with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try yourself .
CD ; throw out the last piece : cru@@ ising this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folders for temporary files : when you cross this folder , then / must be stored the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files is present . if the field is not been crossed , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
everything to enter as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything .
--@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned previously , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and energy consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; meeting point for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
just put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to codi@@ fy W@@ AV files : for a Du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to run more than one W@@ AV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic establishment of &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; used . if you chose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described , like the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard drive has been described and up . first , a connection to the Internet is constructed , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data is described in this section must be repeated for every releasing &amp; CD .
since we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , watch the screen photos a little different from the data you have for one &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD manually instead of retrieve them from the Internet . comments will point out the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD has to be set , into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , like in the screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; it could be read and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers depending on the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully completed by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled out and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be built @-@ up , and you can select the database entry , according to your opinion the best to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have the starting box chosen for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) have chosen , you can also manually trigger this by choice of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - entering CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the dates for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; latest title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be typ@@ ed in the input field &apos; Pres@@ ent &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments on each piece , the commentary box of the album will be used for comments which apply for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful cancellation of the data from the free@@ DB the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and at only 28 characters for the commentary volume . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field len@@ ght , at least on what &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ Set@@ ters tab ; take a look at the section &apos; preferences &apos; section .
you can modify the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all the enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ ding to obtain more information .
simply select an entry which is obvious with the style of the listing CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not submit the &amp; CD . for further information please go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the data collected , which we have collected for the first piece . just enter the entries for the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
this is the third button in the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked as well . just make sure that all the pieces are selected , or add the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
if clicking on the button selection out the reading process was started , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab orders to turn on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the upper left part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a codi@@ fier , which you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that were not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have writing the writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the appearance of the first piece .
the order 1 is read the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus please read out and code parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to op@@ pressing this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with high weak machines , the result is not clear . the calcul@@ ator used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while a different piece is coded , and a third order is coded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left corner of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fier of your choice .
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is already included with CV@@ S , however , you can download an anonymous copy here . however , most distri@@ butions are already included with CV@@ S . if you are reading this package , install the package k@@ dem@@ ult@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is directed to persons who compile source files and are not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how to adapt the program to your needs when it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different other programs has many variations in settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different mapping maps of settings and also includes comments for options which are not used in the example .
hi , still reading on ? even if only the help menu after the initial start of the program was clicked , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in drive , or from the unusual short menu ?
what this is all about ? who reads this , probably already has the program started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual too &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; should you also always want to add or modify something useful , may it do . at least just after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has released this section and therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange if we have succeeded to pick the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; K@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and carav@@ ans from &amp; k@@ de . besides others he has with real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ a@@ oke liz@@ ard @-@ liz@@ ings of texts also some characteristics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player does not have .
&amp; K@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S System , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; D ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ oft @-@ project operator , which is required for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequence .
&amp; K@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changeable color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by lifting the weigh@@ ted keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows on KM@@ ide .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the process used .
seating support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; termination of a song , KM@@ 1 starts next time with the same song again .
supports external MIDI @-@ Synthes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , using its help you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this works also with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and stu@@ d the button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu piece or create the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then play@@ back . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the template @-@ LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a play is played , a pressure on the button bar , like a print on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu item , so breaks the reproduction . if you play down the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; reproduction .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text likes , others use lyrics , and again other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out which events are to be presented and even better : the Ere@@ gn@@ ist@@ type is automatically determined to activate a song , so you will automatically choose the kar@@ a@@ oke text automatically . however , you still have the ability to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a E@@ ign@@ ist@@ watch , select from the menu settings the entries text events or rec@@ al@@ mon@@ ds . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you sum up . these are played in the series after . in this section stands , as you can efficiently use collections efficiently .
to put a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then give the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the desired ones in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection you get all the songs that you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concerns that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears in turn the file dialog , using its help you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece by opening ( using file Open or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not activated , opening one piece it is activated and emp@@ tied to the temporary collection . this collection will then be added to the opening items .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click to Rem@@ ove .
you can select the sequence in which the songs will be played . if you select the sequence according to the sub@@ menu theme of the menu , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select a button next song , the entry next song from the menu item , or press the arrow right .
to jump around a song again , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece off the menu item , or push the button arrow left .
to clear a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button delete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter since it is stored in the departure of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map general @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and can therefore sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI map , because all Sound@@ card GM - compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file , which saves all the necessary settings for the play@@ back of a piece .
each section must only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear so often as desired . however , for this reason , however , that each occurrence may be a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot;
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as an E @-@ Mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible with devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section it is indicated , as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is thought that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line to one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . to this end , wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ P section :
if so , if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun sample ) it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , with which every sound is a different per@@ use instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the sound does the sound height of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how notes are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of the lines is very important , just as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names on the first line .
Key@@ maps are used most of all to make notes on the hair@@ pin channel . look at the charts as an example .
this section can be used to switch some channels to another . if you want to for@@ ego the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these adjustments are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion to a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following patterns :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name Name for this canal . if you use key@@ map option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case then will always be used patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k patch on the Persian canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o will be multip@@ lied with the value pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Events with the value n , this is re@@ funded with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only then passed . the value of 40@@ 96 is used to stand in the map file ( not dec@@ imal scales ) .
this setting is needed because GM adm@@ its that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ player with the value of 40@@ 96 , will play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to try some notes to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; getting around .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole string of cla@@ vi@@ als ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ atures you can see which sounds are played exactly .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , it doesn &apos;t seem green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to indicate the played notes . the view select in the menu settings under the point of edge view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed at which a song is played and the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , De@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; if that happens , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support compiled . to fix the issue you must download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
agreed , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows .
before you activate definitely the setting of automatic added to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can adjust the arrow @-@ button on the left from the template @-@ screen to slow the play@@ back . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; trans@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or viol@@ ently ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting of an automatic tracking to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you just want to play the first file . so imagine the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; K@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t take much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , record music and prove things .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ho@@ .@@ es
you really make me a big z@@ est thing , if you send me a postcard from your home or an MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . before you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and of anyone going to make money for it . I therefore want to stress that I just keep on programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - correc@@ ting the error , that the pitch @-@ height at A@@ we @-@ Cards was too high .

in addition , can &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the home page you can watch the development , find information and look at pictures . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends mainly on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound@@ card , except that you won &apos;t be able to hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as play@@ back DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ r ; was not yet over yet , and was installed on this machine .
for additional help , please review The KDE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window of information that only appears when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarchy . if you click on a entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play@@ back starts with the clicked entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , TV and perman@@ t playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do that if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed through an editor , but also by application itself . this includes a next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select from the menu , select the same with playlist , and select either the folder mode , or selected another category .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all changes are lost when the procedure mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ Players ; some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and closing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during the start does not need to be short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end of the animation however annoying , the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = &quot; in@@ tel ; &amp; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit ; In source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ Players ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ Players ;
there is a rider on the configuration of the player in the config dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here the path can be set from the player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ Players .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration panel of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c , as is the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &quot; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type A / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnis@@ hing dialog file will be given to KDE .
the trans@@ quer@@ or or player player ; is to start in a consoles , and after error messages related to the loading of the browser Module library . the stolen process is called kn@@ it player . if there is no error occurring , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus getting a pre @-@ designed back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also found ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should reproduce all the og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner device and TV channels need to be configured . in addition , the scanner file can be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configuration of the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ Players is the dialog in settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ D port . there , ports should be identified by which one is selected . for example , it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has contained a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of play@@ ux extension should be working for the X server . for this reason , the video@@ pro@@ lin@@ ux extension should be functional to the X server . therefore , the video file must contain in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally used by KM@@ players for the sources different names are used . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this dv@@ d source , source source , t@@ v@@ indic@@ ative , fi@@ del@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist .
are there hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is run as user root after installation of the device . thereby it is sure to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM drive to the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be insp@@ ected on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is covered . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last recorded value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interface and network support and is required for the compile of &amp; k@@ ile ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably applied to the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) in@@ accessible .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be put to a DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are listed on the ile ; website .
this manual is available to everyone - regardless of the experience with l@@ atex ; , &amp; cold ; , &amp; b ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual again . however , all suggestions about documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact details should be made .
if you have any questions or the compile from &amp; k@@ ile ; or if desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the raw material . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to complete all &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical environment and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all the source and conversion tools for this . in conclusion , the easy to use assistant , the l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn how to put the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; Kate .
available &amp; l@@ atex ; is the correct selection : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . w@@ aging the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also be a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros may be used . a less demanding but realistic giving is that it is derived from the sur@@ names of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
considering here only a good distance to l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to manage &amp; l@@ atex ; properly rule be proper , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ ield .
just as other mark@@ er languages includes l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page numbered and text box are specified with the text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ in class , the body with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ using { document } .
the Quick @-@ starter Assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a common feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; a rush ; the selection of the document ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers a number of options for creating the document . there are also some options for the document to be made .
documentation : this is hereby known to document the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; de art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; S@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; official &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
code : this is made using the strings . it should use the strings of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 code as a standard . if , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be executed ( for correct processing of l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used accessories for l@@ atex ; . for the integration , they only move in the cross @-@ field .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts .
new users now don &apos;t worry . it is a brief description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors , the her@@ edi@@ er areas of a gr@@ assy text on the screen , it is with great probability that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you may have noticed it through the modest appearance of output file . however , it will be saved by reducing time and upwards .
with automatic processing of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a space line ( for the input of the text ) and the added line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ using { command } ) . this function can be de@@ ple@@ ted in the menu .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ vert element ) :
for the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click .
in creating the own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files ( narro@@ wing ) file , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in l@@ atex ; source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF the entire output of &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and systems .
the elements of the DV@@ I ; file is drawn with the editor and once upon an element in the DV@@ I ; file cle@@ fts . the default search is lost . once on a section in the l@@ atex ; source code has been clicked , becomes the corresponding place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer j@@ umped .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master @-@ document can be set to project settings .
quick installation : the l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file formats : in this mode the DV@@ I ; file is detected , and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the quick @-@ installation .
in case of edit tool@@ bar , the three major sel@@ ections are stri@@ pped in the document . the first selection field is for the quick structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection range has been included in the terms of articles such as tags , Fu@@ sions , notes or references . the range of options are :
name : with this command a name for one section , an image or different element is created .
cover : is used for the reference to a specified term ( selection on a selection field ) .
by contacting a quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . by &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; cold .
the last selection field with its name is used for defining the font . it can be used for the main text , the joints , etc . there are the following fon@@ ts available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ acking settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ , class included the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the font . if the font does not set at the beginning , this may also happen in the text .
once the above source code was typ@@ ed , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled . the easiest way to do this is the usage of the building or the button &apos;s quick@@ est .
the code text must be stored before the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage of it automatically .
noted the compile of the document , should be searched for the errors in the log . when using fast @-@ installation , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be observed .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text , which is different from the rest@@ ful document . for example , a report with the font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ using { environment } .
the options are only attended within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no sign@@ age ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many options for locking the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it may include certain fon@@ ts , fat , courses , courses , under@@ wear , etc . these commands may occur either with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the short course and is long as long as it is closed down with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be explained with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ score : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background to write the source code with l@@ atex ; mark@@ er language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; b ;
once in the ass@@ istants a bit of text was inspired , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . you should be mind@@ ful quote , a few places in the fat and short course and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , using Editor &apos;s View or Str@@ g E you can return to the editor ( with an external viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script language . simply try and fun .
DV@@ I ; is a smaller file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ist ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer are created . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi edition like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Shift or computer screen .
for the printing of an &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - the document can be printed correctly ( if the printer is properly set ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file has been created from the l@@ atex ; source code , the transformation can begin into various formats using the button in tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the link &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives the direct leap from the editor to byp@@ ass position inside the DV@@ I ; file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; binary files . for this , only Modern in settings must be put up in the box ... tools building blocks .
to cover the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source , and shall be clicked on preliminary search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer is done .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; b ; enclosed . this must be defined as a text editor ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; used as a text editor ... Editor )
if in the application of fast @-@ installation of the &amp; DV@@ I ; -@@ Vie@@ ws , a bug can be present . if an error is available , this is displayed in the log file or in the News@@ window in summary .
the log file is ring@@ ed the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can track down the error @-@ like La@@ Te@@ X errors and the correct La@@ Te@@ X errors . in the editor , the log file appears to be clicked on the error in the log file , and st@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template used for the document .
when selecting le@@ qui@@ al document , a document can either be written from scratch or used to help the assistant to quickly create a new document . further information on this can be included in the section .
frequent users of l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be found in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file skill@@ fully or a new file must be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using a document using an existing document and document templates .
when creating a new document from a template using file New , some character chains are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or strings ) . these variables can be adjusted in settings K@@ ile ... settings must be adjusted .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering document class . typically , it will be used as such : \ \ The class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the resulting commands built in the Editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps has been accomplished :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the default .
a template can be created from any own l@@ atex ; a simple way to create a template , should be searched for a template and be carried out under the steps described below .
&amp; cold ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and her@@ b@@ ating from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made in the range tools directly out &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his options should learn the guide to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile have you can start there directly with reading of the chapter working with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be accessed through the menu of La@@ Te@@ X Re@@ ference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penetr@@ ated Str@@ g button to ev@@ ade the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way , clicking on \ \ par with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when reading the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker , the selected text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
if using the arrow buttons , you can choose parts of the source code in the editing window .
&amp; K@@ ile ; has the courage to search for different kinds of source texts and to highlight this . for example , the l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many ass@@ istants can be included in the utilities or the corresponding check@@ box , or the corresponding check@@ box , or the corresponding check@@ box . this jump is also highlighted , so that it will automatically type on the first input of a character .
sizing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; already outstanding features have been added in &amp; cold ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source files are provided . &amp; l@@ atex ; specifically orders for their selection . under sizing , the following commands are included in the text selection :
usually , a complete paragraph includes ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not covered with all sheets , l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ it@@ ative thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the discount is separated by two empty lines .
use the word under the current cur@@ sor@@ position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a round cells ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) will end in the end .
for the opening of a part of the document it may be removed from this first and through wir@@ ing the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands , for a faster result . under edit , the following commands include :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of mach@@ ining paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fies that environments play a central role in l@@ atex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for NF other commands under sizing , for an easy work with l@@ atex ; .
with this command , in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly from the command to the near surroundings .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the locker .
if the cursor in front or within the command \ \ begin { environment } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many spar@@ ked ambient commands , quickly the old view may be lost . this command reach the recently paved environment , so the vei@@ led ambient structure is not broken .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands as well as the l@@ atex ; groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edi@@ ting Te@@ X @-@ group are a few important commands that match them from mach@@ ining environment .
this command will be sc@@ anned in the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor will be placed directly in front of the suff@@ oc@@ ative brack@@ et .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the ref@@ usal brack@@ et .
if the cursor is before or behind the dr@@ um@@ med brack@@ et of one &amp; tex ; group # # is inj@@ un@@ ted to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many snow @-@ tel@@ ev@@ ed groups brack@@ ets can quickly reach the old view . this command fills the recently occupied group , so the vei@@ led structure of the &amp; tex ; groups do not break down .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple application signs are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; for two simple application signs is used . also for the termination of the request , the sign &apos; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and in case of two dropped anchor signs for l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic pick @-@ up of the double check @-@ signs can set up in settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and left @-@ off .
there are also other specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and can be used by German or fran@@ che . there are also many other languages available .
in the Dr@@ ums of Shift ; input key , a smart poin@@ ter break . if the current position is located within a lists of environment ( eg , enumer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , not only a new@@ line break but also the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ with a shut down shows off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to contain pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support . these can be added under settings , set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users wanted to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seek to enlarge . if this tab@@ ulator is not the associated line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the typical , for the sm@@ iles &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ space for the column position of the current standings .
although &amp; Kate ; already developed a good source code , this was built in &amp; c@@ ile ; in order to have special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still expanded . these modes also work for different working methods under settings K@@ ile to establish ... accompl@@ ishing .
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } is } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
by wir@@ ing the button @-@ key , the last letter of entry is removed and you may choose the pre@@ matur@@ ing list . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ unk from entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively , jumping ar@@ ks can be checked , so a simply jump to these positions by doing spr@@ ing@@ n@@ ste rankings and that parameters then be introduced .
simple settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; trans@@ former settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different w@@ inters available for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands as well as cas@@ u@@ dder to the general language used .
command mode is not suitable for completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of complete mode will result in a large list with ambient mode . on the other hand , the environments on the other hand are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments to the de@@ fle@@ ction .
if you call the actu@@ ator mode via the menu or key@@ key Alt + Shift key , the command becomes automatically di@@ pped off the environment and it appears in \ \ begin . after that , the ambient complete will be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the input function will be finished .
once this has been accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list location , even a first \ \ item command will be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ ile , set up ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully equipped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be made to these lists . this mode uses the inser@@ tion mode for the default mode for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; supports custom lists of arm@@ rests , which can immediately be replaced by L@@ Ã ¼ n@@ g@@ ere strings . as an example of a dishwasher list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word perf@@ ecting mode is entered , the menu features or key@@ key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large whales are not helpful for automatic de@@ parts . however , it has been established that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters have to be written more than once in a document . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the Provider for all already written parties .
this mode can set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ P@@ ile P@@ ile P@@ ile P@@ ile ! here also the swelling value can be specified for viewing the damage .
the actu@@ ator files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / complete / mode / complete Home folder . mode is available for initiation ( check@@ box ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .

PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but also offer excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output can be added , the pages may be arranged with a few &amp; post@@ script ; it can be arranged with ps@@ 2@@ pdf file .
to watch the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled , the source tools are group@@ ed into the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creating conver@@ ging and creating presentation .
for the compile of the source code for viewers such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the other transformation can be used by the key ; 2 ; then the DV@@ I ; file is converted into a PS @-@ file by the old ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file is seen in a PS @-@ file and will be viewed through old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the instruction of command , a spect@@ ator is usually inv@@ oked after the compile . if no one @-@ less observer should be used , each time a new window will be opened .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have been with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ plau@@ d ; even so little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ ins will benefit from the additional functionality instantly and don &apos;t have to wait until someone turns the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements used . find out more about it below .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . this means that the following dialog is opened :
this dialog enables to ad@@ minister all the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project for several persons in a manner of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves as unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and expresses the button as expresses . currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after which you are : text .
nickname and attitude of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for more information on comments .
besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : an event for information to team leader can be created when something specific is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be the record of the opening and end of the project so that later it can be viewed , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script created a file to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project implementation dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recipients - the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i can be set up such ladder .
note are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments using the following items :
specify notes is simple . it can be selected either from the editor -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in an commentary volume followed by the following text .
remarks can be sent to a determin@@ at@@ able member of the Team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nickname of the sub@@ project manager sub@@ project manager for the departments - and sub@@ project leaders should be introduced to the respective departments or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roller names are independent of large or small case , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D agnos@@ tic and is supported web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using settings qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages , which are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car @-@ completion can be changed . the entries are :
big / to@@ graphy of tags : big / lo@@ or@@ tho@@ graphy of automatically inser@@ ted tags . normal Groß / infants , the tags are inserted as they are described in the following XML files .
large / batch of attributes : big / lo@@ or@@ tho@@ graphy of automatically incorporated attributes . normal wholesale / small writing means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if attached , is available for tags , for which the subsequent tag is optional , this immediately according to the tags .
optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start - and finish day automatically update : if switched , the final day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic er@@ set of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during the inser@@ tion .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ e@@ types for detection of different types of files . using the button standard , the standard benefits may be restored .
standard string code : coding of newly created files or in other ways as with file opening files ( where the coding of the file may be passed over ) . however , this setting will spread from the same into the project @-@ part if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ T@@ D won &apos;t be recognized . however , this setting will spread from the same into the project part if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a blackout , or crash at the next start of the program the document of this backup can be restored . this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the time presented .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view ( or documentation in a mapping ) , what makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings for the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ ks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command parameters .
the warning range is intended to control the tax of the possibility of turning their warnings by An@@ ha@@ ken of no more .
the place for changing the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in divided mode .
here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which depic@@ ts the figure of Par@@ ser @-@ knot@@ s in the document , to be put in details .
in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse @-@ slip action .
in the struc@@ tur@@ tree settings , the visibility of the no@@ des can be opened in the tree , the actu@@ alisation of the tree when mach@@ ining and how deep with a change of structural tree will be automatically opened . empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while vac@@ ate groups are those that have not found an element in the current document .
the area for fixing abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will un@@ folds with editing to full text . abbrevi@@ ations are available in groups , each can give for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , which means , it can give a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ us@@ ur@@ ron@@ ym will mean something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications of the third page , which can be re@@ used by any of the part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located on a booth like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the folder folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode download : check whether this plugin has refused to load . only @-@ read @-@ box will usually refuse the store when this option is not chosen .
overclo@@ cking the plugin : is this activated , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ plau@@ d ; if the information provided is correct . selecting the entry also then if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ging has been completely newly developed . the support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations about plug@@ ins .
currently , only one plug @-@ in is available that adds support to the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
the use of the Debug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of a monitored variables is displayed . usually occurs in the left @-@ hand Dock .
a view , in which all the holding numbers , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , manufactured , or it shares the plug @-@ in with to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan &apos;s needs . this action is opened by default , when a project is opened , which must normally not be respected .
the counter@@ part to Debug@@ ger session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server for a debit request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger issue .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to begin and information on the monitored variables as well as the currently exec@@ utable line constantly . if this happens , the execution continues , before a Deb@@ u@@ gan request was started , the script starts with the request .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger , to start with the execution of the script , without information on monitored variables and the current point number . if this happens when a script is stopped , the execution continues before a debit request was commissioned , the execution starts as soon as a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction to the script without responding into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes faul@@ tless .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next as if there was the current one .
opens a dialog , in which an variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the over@@ laid value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value of variable .

this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also Tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alog@@ ical , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ri ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ making enable a quick insert of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing than folder . they only contain the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML @-@ files . tag folder wear the name of writing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and de@@ kl@@ ari@@ ed whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to allow other users to gain better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is set out in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself otherwise nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument to the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for type meth@@ od@@ ine valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an Commons Attri@@ but@@ ler and the attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; day . that &apos;s a just element type element .
describe an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it sets the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags , describing how this attribute is to be shown , etc ; This is a only element element .
provides the source materials used for filling in the tag of Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree at
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for the achievement of the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting table and a method name . arguments that can be transferred to the method . can be empty or % date , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day the elements of a list are group@@ ed together . it can occur for one attribute only once . it is a only element element element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue party . this day can happen for any attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the item is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in a dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that can occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this item is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with one &amp; XML ; declaration ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be gre@@ ased and closed properly .
spaces influence nothing , but take care on &amp; and &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ow this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not make a leg effect , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog upwards in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present , the check only takes place in the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes it &amp; lt ; Schema &gt; element out of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file one &amp; PHP will be described ; the fil@@ en@@ ame of these Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag # = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor that achie@@ vable via D@@ T@@ D Be@@ es D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created an easy &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ plau@@ d ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 transitional provision ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ names .
an action can be set up with settings actions ... created . click to New Action leads to the same dialogue :
this is a weigh@@ ted short@@ cut . with clicking on the button user &apos;s button , a button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation can be allocated ; using one is the current short@@ cut short distance .
the simplest promotions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . themselves are the Quick start @-@ dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter should be given . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although skilled paths allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir Vari@@ able in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process replaced . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; only one instance runs , the text is uniqu@@ ely attached to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the dat@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods there can be a script provided by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the standard input . in the drop @-@ box input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are :
select text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually recommended with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the introduced application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two kinds of output : normal output , to the standard output . it can be specified , which is to be specified with the text written on the standard output by placing the value of the selection field :
when there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add and configure actions . select Settings settings .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
complete all the required fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use their use , enable dialog &quot; tag to deal &quot; if available so that a input can be made when contacting the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics and other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size of others .
please note that the created icon will not only assist you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green , usually interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled , a message to the user , clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag will insert in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this will happen through the menu with attitudes actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so there are still what are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complete some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should make this a better overview by some Tren@@ ner in several groups . please open the tool@@ bar to adjust the tool@@ bar to make use of the tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how Tren@@ to support group@@ ing . anyone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by trying all the symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be im@@ root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I first saw a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could notice in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. -@@ repository whether someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search a existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second we treat here .
# KDE configurations file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = path , relative to this file , e.g. Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 1.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = T@@ 1 html 2 = html 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html page 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP documentation :
# KDE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html = In@@ tro@@ duction = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ onom@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . it indicates that this is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the chess pros ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and in consequence at the top of the belly show &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but take care of &amp; and &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all the XML @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
the index stage is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed for the user @-@ sensitive help . by marking the function named and pressing by C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of the top @-@ separated context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply while $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository of the use through the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ on@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the ex@@ cre@@ ased resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who will be sent to . at different places there will send an email menu entry such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , machine tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the users are reviewed and only made available if our team need them as correct and useless for publication . to make an easy contribution we recommend to signing resources , where there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked about their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you may need to pass a off . in dialogue New resource , the input fields have to be empty ) and with clicking on OK the up@@ loading will be started .
the upload can upload from the D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to load tool@@ bar , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , nor before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the sig@@ nia . in the case of problems warns and it can then be broken . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a notification appears with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages , which is currently not provided by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but the creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files could be necessary in an open XML format . there is the simpler Way to convert a D@@ T@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and Conver@@ ting of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
directory _ name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tion@@ er : the string that is im ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , like HTML Public / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; after transforming the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first introduce these concepts to them , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ plau@@ d ; little value .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three parts : global , locally and proj@@ ect@@ . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . of tool@@ making through actions is all that is marked as a global , in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ plau@@ d ; this allows the group of administrators different to secure tools , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers to a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tools . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ ing with special promotions designed specifically for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ ment window , the building views , the carto@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bar . please beat in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the Kar@@ tei@@ rider with the right mouse button to receive a short@@ cut menu with the current document for pass@@ codes , like close the current , other or all the party @-@ rider , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right button in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the specified document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing of the mouse , using the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file .
at the top of the editing panel are the tool@@ bar of the editor . at present , &amp; equ@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of machine tools is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bar are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ making is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this just added tag . should it insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as Anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction systems ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , they open and wander through . in the presentation with carto@@ ons are available for files , project , sample files , document structure , attributes , and documentation components .
project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ plau@@ d . this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project by means of right click . actions such as Add , Dele@@ te , up@@ loading or delete the files from memory medium can be carried out with the text @-@ click menu .
another option from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it &apos;s all open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local assists only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is in use .
here you will find information about available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with e @-@ mail .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links to an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through right @-@ clicking of an element it opens a list of commands with regards to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other side views . with it , some can change attributes and nam@@ ing . this allows the change of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here &apos;s the complete documentation on the web @-@ technology for your development to find . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two be@@ aters at the bottom end of the window , using the beneficial information can be achieved : the intelligence window and the problem window .
this mapping is displayed information on any one in the Qu@@ anta ongoing script . for example , the currently used D@@ T@@ D of the current document and any changes to D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
this diamond rider displays all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate box of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; sends the tool@@ bar in an email . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can assure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. as any other .
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files to your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have trouble passing from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 at the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web @-@ development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a fast web @-@ development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor to create , the developers began to employ &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up @-@ language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web @-@ development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above needs to be held that &amp; equ@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows web developers the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ) . this can enhance automation almost every task . through the program com@@ it@@ ters they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , without any interference with any scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more about them find them in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded into a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information in detail documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; input , or remote center help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick overview list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not listed , whereby the oldest record is taken .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pres@@ et , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts with inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML , so that it is displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ assignment , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor per day .
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; pus@@ h@@ button .

search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined out@@ press to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
formation of the problem ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem @-@ re@@ porter is activated once you change to the struc@@ tur@@ tree .
displays the symbols left of the main window on the left side of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu along with the submission or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu named after the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file ( web@@ j@@ j ) .
presents a dialogue to include files in the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folders or sub@@ folder and add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
loads of a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bar and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be stored by means of settings ... to be added to the tool@@ bar , or you will be asked to save the tool@@ bar you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of vision . this does not delete them from the disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
to send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows to load devices to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
invite one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or any someone else has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; is sensible if the entities are to be drawn from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this world is globally and a typ@@ ist not present in the global KDE folder , it fails .
this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day admission dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ Speci@@ fic sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or disable the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar failed when this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .

checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D by using external application .
immediate conver@@ gence between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries , the conver@@ tion sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the mapping mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu has an entry for each open window , with a selection of a setup , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches on the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog greatly affect any application , using the K@@ HTML part , including the &quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
sets the behavior of the editing pane . in the documentation of Kate Kate ; find details .
a dialog appears when you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or what to add and change the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the mouse setting in the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from above to bottom , for example after filling in the project , the whole directory structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small @-@ case letters and without blank spaces with extension web@@ stre@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you will find the server address of the machine on which you want to access , one , except you handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . when a joint collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bar . if a joint collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ vers@@ ei@@ ling scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to act differently .
An@@ ge@@ ha@@ kt makes , if files , which are to be involved somewhere in the main folders of the project . if a project is started anew , not wet .
with this option all the files and folders are displayed within the main ord@@ ners and you can make a precise choice of your choice .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by plug@@ ging or , by removing the h@@ ooks , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project @-@ properties in the menu room in the sub@@ window profiles , or with the short@@ cut @-@ short shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are re@@ printed on project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ indicated ore are excluded from the project .
the proj@@ ector , which is loaded when opening the project . in fact , more about project reports can be read .
this way the desired Debug@@ ger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed you can find in . the Debug@@ ger Plugin can be adjusted with the desired options . in the de@@ bug , the de@@ bug is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles upload high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a page overview for the content of the server for any profile , by showing your own sub@@ view of each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window events configuration , one can turn it into event actions and add these actions to change or delete . events actions are executed when a specific event occurs , such as the Glos@@ sy of a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was open . however , this behavior can not currently affect .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an expansion .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; closed , the project file will automatically be stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files happens . the same happens when you load a new project .
the Project Manager gives free access to the files in the project . the files in the current project can be managed .
folders in@@ behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the high @-@ site files . see .
allows to removing the current profile . if only a longer exists a profile , the button is ab@@ used to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about it . this possibility is useful when common loading files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the record store -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ air profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server that the files should be copied . either a fully qualified Dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and stop .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discretion . your password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bar . it can give in a project many views , i.e. by simply means of exchange , various files and tools can be downloaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bar .
views can be saved in the men@@ ue project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings Tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar , can be opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with whom one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the one &apos;s working method .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to make use of the menu tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ in . adding tool@@ bar to be added below in the section &quot; Add Tool@@ bars . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either using context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new tool@@ bar can be removed , the tool@@ bar can ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar to be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions on this or other machine tools are to be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition , the entries will remove action and display action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the machine tools and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool to set up ... and settings are set .
templates are essentially documentary skel@@ eton , code @-@ car@@ vers and files for inter@@ connection . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a nasty fil@@ es@@ ystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or pack any existing directory in the template @-@ tree . templates , in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in roughly the limitations one provides for the fil@@ es@@ ystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms used at the beginning of each pattern prior to use .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file excluding text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available under global templates . further information to the Tem@@ plate tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information on templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted back on a template , but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment using a final mark to Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information on templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. .
design a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose file To save as a local template ....
once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project presentation ) the template is not visible in the project tree ; see the template @-@ tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on file To save your choice as a local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag the selection with drag@@ ons and deri@@ ves on the charts templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be dropped into a template folder . it can be used to use all file administration functions , such as pulling and dra@@ ins or inser@@ ting the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder , or in the project files of construction , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project proposals allow a very targeted way @-@ oriented procedure . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound .
the sub@@ structure structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stated in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / / anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates
to set the behavior of a folder , click on the front @-@ hand mouse button with the right mouse button , click on the folder and to select from the context menu Properties ; the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous Attribute ver@@ b is hal@@ ted .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except for the tribal structure . if a root folder would be set in principle , it would be explicitly activated in this path unless they would appear explicitly . in the case of a normal folder the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder .
allows a set or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows the copying of table templates to a folder with special Head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , using the context menu ( show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which is accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code in two parts : the source code Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch if necessary to the source code Editor , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that includes &amp; php , shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ision of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor will continue to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode functions exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are activated both in the code Editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will be activated , this mode is already active , pressing the key@@ press in the active cursor from a window to another , where the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation unit between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code Editor is set to set up via settings qu@@ anta . upon choosing V@@ PL ; you can also choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span . basically , the recommendation is recommended : a small span@@ ish for fast machines and a large chip for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page , it is possible to select tools document properties . this is also called the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also change :
met@@ a @-@ tags permit the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. tags for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of content , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word @-@ 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as possible with met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ template by pressing the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is as described in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is especi@@ al . the mark@@ er works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing and means back @-@ bar or removal button .
inser@@ ting tags in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code Editor , are made . it is noted that inser@@ ting tags are already existing available tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , each other giving anchor itself needs to be removed .
some tools like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists are disabled . they will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining styles of style . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ ling , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style base can be prosec@@ uted .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ per@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g det@@ ects the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded style file with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the Work@@ folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a sty@@ list file .. / en / x@@ ac@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command it is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a fore@@ age called QNA@@ ME or an specified model name . &amp; win ; template agrees with any QNAP ME to match the string template .

start a shell . enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
adds the parameter to the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ TER ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E ; add to the X@@ SL @-@ ambient variable . see also the documentation for the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
runs the conversion 20 times when --@@ it is tw@@ o@@ fold , the conversion will be executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files when the support for li@@ b@@ x@@ ml has been activated .
activ@@ ates the X@@ include processing of the input document , if the support is enabled in li@@ b@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default .
on systems with installed read@@ line library you can browse with the arrows on / off due to the rel@@ avant @-@ storage of the orders issued so far .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes may be used to put together phrases as an argument . &amp; eg . : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a holding point in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; added .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists of only the AS@@ C@@ II characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ pl@@ ate@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the system of the user . at Uni@@ x@@ - or cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems also other environment variables are allowed .
path : a path to the transfer of the work@@ ners . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML @-@ data or the XML _ document , which is dealt with by the sty@@ ling . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ ANS ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ ts ;
running time commands : { bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ quit } , step , step@@ Up , step@@ down , next , &quot; run , trace , se@@ top@@ tion , options
there are many graphical tools for comparisons . so why &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors were made many changes , and at the same time a lot of places has been corrected . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts together .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps the intru@@ sion was changed . that changes the result was a little nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; was able to display differences within a line and make changes to white character . later , a lot more useful features were added .
for example , if you would like to quickly compare text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the previous window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and combined by folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the combination Editor under the differences windows allow the rede@@ em@@ ing of conflicts and at the same time reveals the expected outcome . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files at the same time :
&amp; K@@ isp@@ 3 ; also helps you with the comparisons and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ assembled :
&amp; En@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and controlled with it the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ulators become visible . if lines are only shown in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble any more , if someone changes the reverse . )
when a file is identical , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red colour means both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the device &apos;s work easier by completely re@@ writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 2 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 2 Ord@@ inary 2 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3 Ord@@ inary 3
opening dialog enables the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the list . you do not specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be executed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or later merge with folders . if for A one file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then uses &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if the input field is active , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later on saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the comparisons .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison then starts immediately . in Open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pulling and deri@@ ves , simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d just have to load two appropriate files , they are in &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you cannot draw anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the clo@@ ister of text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ ting and deri@@ ve from text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the drawing number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source boxes are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu )
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color that file differs . if both files differ , the pre@@ defined color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( summar@@ ized ) well .
left next to the text is the composite column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it &apos;s useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the processor and in few , rare ones . )
the vertical line , which separates the clash @-@ column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the display @-@ sequence is activated , the line is displayed at broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the latest edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edit the result . usually , it contains it through automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons , jump to a place of the un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line column is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be highlighted a jump of position in the windows where the start of the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group is highlighted in the color background color for current field and each other on the left will appear a black beam .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic processing or manually copy a line in the file ; no line is displayed in the Qu@@ el@@ ist ; this text is only a wild@@ card for the event that you change your mind and perhaps re @-@ choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; deployment conflict ; appears , however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature .
note : if in selecting the sources , ignore the options numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons , right , end , string , beginning and string , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the sur@@ pass@@ able column next to the vertical image panel can be used by clicking also to navigate .
in the window window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and ren@@ aming mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sequence columns syn@@ ced the view of all windows on the beginning of each group ( as already in the section together and the edi@@ table window appears ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture / Str@@ g @-@ Picture ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict , continue to solve as a conflict . therefore , between the rede@@ emed and un@@ solved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark@@ ings in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Cop@@ y button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ ting ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be careful with this option but careful , because you could write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally .
index @-@ ends are stored accordingly to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a poin@@ tless version \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems are using car retro@@ fit \ \ \ \ . K@@ decker 3 does not keep the line files , therefore you should use &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; also not use bin@@ aries files .
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically when you finish the file and restored at the next start . ( menu setup - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog provides also writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences will be displayed in recur@@ sive writing . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some color could not be available in its pure form , but would be framed . on these systems the button @-@ settings automatically represents an odd color .
when enabled , the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator is inserted .
if you press input or Return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board drops up then .
you can select which drawing type you prefer to save . the set value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
with the same of files tried &amp; diff@@ 3 ; first to find all the completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step can be ignored the white character . the second step is compared each line . in this step white character will not be ignored . also , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon mark &apos; \ &apos; and a poin@@ tless version &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again store only one new@@ line copy &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if this option is enabled , or if a white character is enabled , however , how a white character is dealt with . during the default , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default this option is disabled . in the first part of analysis you will ignore numbers and per@@ tin@@ ent characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intense after smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files .
in the Autom@@ atic process mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict will be j@@ umped into .
dis@@ solving automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( pre @-@ employed is manual choice . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you &apos;re using this only from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflict in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore ignore C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning the folders and run a merger . see for details under the link to the directory comparison and arrangement .
if a file is stored and an older version already exists , then the original version is displayed .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adapting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you have to stop and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; G@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , for all entries the upper setting is used .
above the selection fields for coding a short hint about what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has for you pure formal character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpret . as the coding for each file is individually set , even files can be compared and combined with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be saved for storing .
if you define application commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the sub@@ title command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
please turn it down to sup@@ press pro@@ vision@@ ing changes in white characters in the text or review files . ( note : this also applies to changes in figures or comments when the options are to ignore or ignore notice C / C + + -@@ Com@@ ments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed beside the normal yet another second @-@ circle column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines . simply drag the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
orders the comparison side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
sometimes you consider the differences and then choose immediately to finish the files together . a simple click launches the compilation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ specified name for the output file . ( when this function is used to re@@ boot ) then the name of the last used file is kept . )
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; # diff@@ 3 , then the output of the instruction is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut @-@ out disrup@@ tive parts or to correct installation .
when reading a file , it is first delivered to this external statement ( see above ) , then the output of the instruction is specified only when drawing up this procedure . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have an associated output line .
the thought behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external application is needed , and most users would not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l totally sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processor command to convert the entry into upper case letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ s . the \ \ U is related to the found text in upper case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords in order to create automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ enz@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another application command line . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; each sign between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each player will be replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple conditions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions apart . for example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different like e.g. per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ening / switch &apos;@@ aller@@ dings include in per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the move &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor will maintain for the display and to bring together . further operations only change the data that can be seen in the index @-@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ line @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor command are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or are hidden , you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; entire folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate this and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without it really perform ,
... selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only using the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparison and merge of individual files very similar . you only have to specify folders on the command line or in a dialog file .
when three folder are assembled , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder was specified , it uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not match that . to boot that , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder you will notify you a small news window on current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , that were compared to that .
if the scanning of the folder is closed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of a list with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder of the scan found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can double @-@ click a folder by clicking on the + / - clicking the arrow menu or by clicking the arrows to the left / right . the directory menu contains two sub@@ directories , containing all sub@@ directories of which you can open all folders or folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file is immediately started and it appears a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the dat@@ at@@ ype is different in other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merger version will not be automatically selected . if that is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the above image are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black .
with identical entries the colour is also identical , although the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical when their entire content is identical . then , Fol@@ der also have the same color . with folders , the age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red is red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copying from B ( or if B does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying from A ( or if a does not exist , extingu@@ ishing the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : mistakes : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be run together .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : mistakes : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be run together .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories is active , then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to im@@ mobil@@ ise both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the output copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are activated , then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copying . if the files are different , but the same date appears . if the files are identical .. As long as such errors are not removed , the file may not be started .
when summar@@ ized , a file is processed after another . it status column shows fer@@ ent when the result was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something was unexpected , you should make a last review and check if the status is all right .
if in the dialog dialog , the file method is selected by the method of full analysis , K@@ drives will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ vent , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for the rede@@ emed conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merger actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring it together .
please note : if you do not have the target folder , then it will be used in the three @-@ folder mode , then the two @-@ folder mode will be chosen and used for sync , A and / or B is used as a destination .
if you have chosen a target folder , please check out if all entries should be in the target folder , also be displayed in the folder structure . there are several options that can be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ lov@@ able surprises :
to complete all entries : select fil@@ es@@ se@@ duction and continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the scanning abbrevi@@ ation ) : select action of the current element - or push F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options through , sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
choose sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without which really changes are made . you will then get an exhaustive list of all actions .
&amp; # diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a composite window will pop up ( keep in mind the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again directories , continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continues .
if &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; on an error , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you see some error messages that can help you choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before going along with it .
if some entries have been brought together individually , you notice &amp; win 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and then bring them together again later . even if this has been summar@@ ised or not saved , those entries will be considered settled . only if you change the composite action , these entries will be squee@@ zed once again .
the settings menu of &amp; Be@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; C@@ decker 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory co @-@ operation with these options :
only files that apply to the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . there are several pattern to be typ@@ ed . separate wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder does not have to match this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be edited more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be edited more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have been a tra@@ der attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems this option is as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be shown in the element tree , or not . this option is switched on the default .
with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default .
with links to folder : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched on , the links such as normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; not applied to possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder of a link in itself would lead to a final loop and &amp; diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is switched off .
performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ ves , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( insert an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare large folders about a slow network , it is likely to compare only the change date and file size . however , this option will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in default .
similar to the chan@@ gel date . no real comparison will take place . the files are considered identical if they are equal . that can be useful for example when copying the chan@@ gel date . please use caution . this option is switched off .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode if two folder are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are selected to match . also the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off .
if there are differences occurring from which the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered unsure as the other file has not been changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another , then the original version becomes ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file exists with .@@ ori@@ g extension already , then this will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal compound of individual files , not just the composite folder . this option is switched on in the default .
usually , the folder @-@ connector could be visible from the composite separate files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the window directory &amp; text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch through switching between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu , there is also an appropriate menu entry . if you save the result , the status will be put on completed and the file will not be squee@@ zed once you boot the folder .
this status will however be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new read
KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ id 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a repository with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should keep in mind :
a path can be relatively und@@ ele@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mask . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit cre@@ denti@@ als or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original is available . ( please note the option of trusted the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose for use is currently as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in differences . to view K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In a diff@@ user @-@ menu from the context menu .
normally the &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , it assumes &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files needs to exist . then starts &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and can be seen from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original text exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the production of the patch file .
if &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; as part of the part , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar , and menu . that merge or the same of folders in the K@@ Part Mode is not supported .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ id 2 ( well He@@ ist it Comp@@ are ) already exist . besides , the name K@@ id 3 already indicates that it can be combined as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff GUI @-@ collection .
I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by watching in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go .
you have told the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be communicated to the correct pre@@ fix . in the default install configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find resources for the user interface ( e.g. , diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white character is different , those lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this type is this but this is is the case .
the editor will notice for every difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file , and it is much effort to create extra its own file format which could store this information .
the effort for this was so far too large . you can restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is sudden ; no sr@@ c becomes linear ; published and the text cannot extingu@@ ish . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; K@@ isp@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more down@@ sizing would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

KDE @-@ dir is given the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; E@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake should be used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut off ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ X or rot@@ ary removal ) copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current curve position and replaced the current marking system .
only differences are displayed : files identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current version version , you have to re @-@ read the folder after changes to the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . )
there are only entries shown that show differences . this also leads that identical files are not already copied into the target folder . if the target folder these files are not already included , they are missing after that . ( the behavior will probably change later in a later program version ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result panel ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed when clicking the button accordingly .
in default this option is disabled . under@@ tones in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) , as differences in white characters are dealt with .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the working space , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , has been clicked , the contex@@ tual menu has only set up the two entries P@@ ager , but has also appear the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries as minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on working surface and closing . the commands create the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to one application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
if this entry box is marked , windows can be shifted within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be shifted with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work areas .
if this field is crossed , in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working spaces are displayed . it is made along with name to be displayed , the names are provided with folders , &amp; eg . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to make their selection possible .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple right corner with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and pixel map showing a small view of the actual program window . note : pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other wind@@ ow@@ ders , as out of P@@ ager applications in some other wind@@ ow@@ ders , horizont@@ ally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops shows in a horizontal row and vertically positioned in a vertical row , which is very well suited for representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ Mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be altered in size , display windows as symbols or with their content , and it also runs outside the control panel .
right @-@ click of the mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and close @-@ down selection of switches ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t want to login to the file , you need to login to your system administrator or log in to your system administrator .
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE @-@ packages .

if you want to start , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen . in the following , this window appears as enlar@@ ging window . in the following , this window appears as enlar@@ ging window . in the following , this window appears as the picture window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting is enlarged &amp; w@@ mag . alternatively , the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a moving picture . alternatively , you can help , make a selected display area in the display window ( selection man@@ nequ@@ in mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor at the screen ( eg . at the left side of the screen ) .
do you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that the box is not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard mechan@@ ic ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection panel to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cursor in the magnific@@ ation window and hold the left mouse button de@@ pressed , so you can draw the contents of the magni@@ fier window and move . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , button @-@ pressing or using the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection stand will remain firm and only the lower right @-@ hand corner is to be moved .
&amp; A may have a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy it into a file to add it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turning the image and much more .
starts and stops the updating of the ad . the St@@ opp@@ en of the update brings that the required CPU @-@ time goes against 0 .
select the update rates ( Very low , low , means , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode is displayed a selection window . the selected range is displayed in a window .

&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a click on the same spot as the mouse @-@ cursor in the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive pen@@ in @-@ in@@ doors syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain is prepared .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a click on the same spot as the mouse cursor . it is meant to help people suffering from repeti@@ tive pen@@ ess In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click pain . besides , it may em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; mou@@ se@@ set@@ ool ; may handle the pain that comes with clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also use pain that are linked to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear again : even if the mou@@ ths tool helps avoid pain , which can be caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain , which is caused by the payment due to the mouse , and as applies to all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for each different .
the use of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ se@@ ool is simple : &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and runs a mouse click if you cut the movement shortly .
is the smart moving activ@@ ating , makes &amp; col@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a pause , after it em@@ ulates the mouse button . move now the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the movement , before the letting go out of the mouse button . this way , you can perform the pulling off the mouse button . the smart moving requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this wei@@ ght@@ time period has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; one mouse click ) .
is smar@@ ter switched on , the torque field is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ pool ; after downloading the mouse button is waiting , before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no notice of the mouse on the mouse .
this function is activated , now supported by mouse clicks . if this function is activated , a slow connection to right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow connection to the left and back leads to a double @-@ click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; however , it can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction time ; go to sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the sound system and here the rider gener@@ a . there is a sli@@ der sound @-@ bu@@ ffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is marked , this setting is marked with &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; at any start from &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values that have been open to opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button for users , the settings will be reset on the status of the application by the application .
it &apos;s best to use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent shifting you should first get off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later get the smart moving .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to decrease the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect will remain : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on jobs in the browser window which does not constitute a link , does not lead to unlimited reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ led , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse .
first , you have to take out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse varies . it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks out the execution of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if you have just started running the smart one , it means that &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation can no longer stop by letting the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ se@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is to execute just a click . by this , the status of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool is reset , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another point .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor in place where you want it . but do not park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you &apos;re looking for scanning . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are prot@@ rac@@ ted . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit the text .
the smart moving is an advanced feature of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very well possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board and re @-@ insert any other promotion , in case you want to move the mouse with the right mouse button . however , some advice will be given to them :
use the smart temp@@ er not , if you just begin to use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; select text instead : execute the switch button down , while you ho@@ ver the mouse on the other end of the text and enter the mouse button .
therefore , use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way it gets j@@ des@@ mal , if &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when with the intelligent shifting the difference time begins . later you can use the smart moving also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use , the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window ; be installed . that should be the case on most system .
the functionality of audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and loud@@ speaker . it is set correctly .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ med . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those creating the mouse keys .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; may also be configured as it is a certain time waiting that a gyp@@ sum process begins before the mouse will start off . in this way , pulling and deri@@ ves with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; F@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ my users can let the computer speak for themselves . users can choose from a list with the course of the conversation , which should be addressed once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which is later used for the text output of text . further details can be found in the description of the text .
on the second page you can choose the standard text pass@@ book . from the text pass@@ agen@@ books you can often choose text passages , without having to type them in . the text passages may of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you specify the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ ment . &amp; k@@ mouth ; it reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can identify the words list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only right letters can be added to the Wor@@ th supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ phy of your phrases ( the lower white area in the screen@@ shot ) and a rel@@ avant @-@ storage of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; properly setup , you can enter the propositions at the input field you want to hear . each named phrase is attached to the reservoir . you can select from it propositions which are to be talked once again .
with the menu @-@ associated settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the entry dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two mapping objects , voice output and settings , the site of Wor@@ ds , as well as page K@@ TT@@ SD language services .
in the input field of the mapping card , type in the command to the voice of speech . in the selection field under the input field , please place the strings with the text to the language generator .
&amp; K@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . choose the cross @-@ box if the text is to be shared as default on the language generator .
if the cross @-@ box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as advertised as language services , the text service will be available on this page . if that is successful , the other settings will be on this page . if this is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . if this option is a stand@@ ardis@@ ed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N , the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you can determine which action by scanning abbrevi@@ ation or by choosing a text passage in the Aut@@ pass@@ book menu or in the list for text pass@@ agen@@ text@@ books .
with the selection of instant bonuses , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and included in the publishing field . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is only entered into the input field .
with the second selection box , the processing window for Aut@@ pass@@ agen@@ das can specify , whether the word pass@@ book is to be stored automatically when closing the processing window .

Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the attitude of the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a Java @-@ language generator . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example the option should be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of applying Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wave@@ file , so you need an additional program to rent the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license permits it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to trans@@ ship the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to write the last sign of the text , so an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option will be switched on as default , must be switched on .

K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
as the c@@ ess@@ ation of the language kit is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as advertised as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
for setting use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , available in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth ; to use successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; co@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and in addition memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; M@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can not speak to be able to un@@ load text by the machine . it is saved a list of pro@@ ges@@ ted sets that the user can always re@@ comp@@ ose again and again .

before you can use , you must install and adjust the program to speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are set up , the carto@@ ons will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the mapping card is displayed .
most T@@ TS @-@ Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are set in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for synthes@@ izer . a so furnished combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed is used as a speaker . you should at least use a spokes@@ man before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard recei@@ vers .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printing plates for the same printer .
if you click on the Car@@ part card reader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ al , the speaker card will appear automatically . it will also appear automatically when you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and is not yet established yet speaker .
all the already furnished speaker appear in this list . the favorite speaker will appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application is not present@@ er .
by clicking a speaker from the list , click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select a spokes@@ man from the list and click on this button to change settings below . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a spokes@@ man from the list , and click on this button to further down the speaker in the list below . the order of the speaker in the list determines also its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; desktop system .
select a m@@ oods here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boy and girl voice to choose from .
when you click here , appears on the new speaker on the speaker card . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; go back to the mapping card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to enable the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text read . click on the mapping to create text orders and to ad@@ minister . see .
if you have at least set up a spokes@@ man , you can set the voice system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the mapping customized to open this mapping . here you can set some general options .
mark this starting box to activate the &amp; desktop system . this starts the KDE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts successfully , the mapping card orders is displayed and you can set text orders and read before . see . remove the mark@@ er , K@@ TT@@ SD will hold and the T@@ TS @-@ system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .

if this entry is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the system area of the Control bar , it disappears again once the reading is completed .
using buttons in this series you can start text orders , break down , stop and resume .
the buttons in this series can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click on users or OK , then all changed settings will be adopted on all sides .
the mapping card will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to run K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the mapping company in general and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , check the text , which is to be read , and select in the main menu tool text read text . after a short time the voice output should start .
it &apos;s almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML , and other invisible brands will also be read also .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read text beforehand . first check the text , which is to be read , and select in the main menu tool@@ bar text read . then , the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta .

in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . you can , for example , establish that when in a IR@@ C channel you appear , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C communication text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filter for drawing up a good option in &amp; kt@@ on ; incorrect or faul@@ ty spoken messages , is a good example . you remove the tags and b sent out the messages , the k@@ mail , and also the term / local / In@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as provided as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filtering the text is dealt , before it will be sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unciation , to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to byp@@ ass certain def@@ ici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is pres@@ umed to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the extended orders will be res@@ umed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning output .
breaking news have the next highest priority . a message breaks down normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of application , the news used . while you &amp; eg have a long text on a website read , you can go with &amp; mouth ; someone who is just entering the room . &amp; nbsp ; aler@@ ts are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text entries . each order you run from the mapping card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text entries are intended for the output prolonged texts that have no particular urgency .
all four levels of order are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen Re@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such pre @-@ reads , this issue will hold and termin@@ ates .
first , you must know that filters can never be applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter will work on the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are made as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the set parts can be delivered either as words or as a regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Shift use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; used by a format to a different format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with Interphone Cell@@ ular@@ line , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set on a speaker card for example , you can read text from KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter appears that its rules do not apply , it gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; aler@@ ted on board ; will be sent by all the activated filters on the page below . the processing of the filter is made in order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter does not be crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be removed from above down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogs .
for the establishment of strings , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text .
insert a name for your filter . you can select this name for any number , but you only have to distinguish from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the order from above to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file to the existing list are attached .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button down .
if here is a value entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the applic@@ ator ID is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the character set filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all conditions are empty . if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when compared with words , the sign @-@ chain filter filter regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be reduced by parti@@ tions ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no guide to writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs to add or edit them as help to arrange this expressions . the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; prin@@ tou@@ ts can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be applied to beneficial XML . it can be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , extends also x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker manufacturer , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is appointed on the speaker card , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can for example define that texts written by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is covered , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is sent by the speaker properties , which the program proposes to the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; to speaker the speaker at the Carto@@ on Card , you can write the speaker to the speaker .
here is a value entered , the filter is applied , in case the text contains the em@@ itted expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular installed , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
insert the characteristics of the desired intercom conditions . if the text is met the filter conditions , the speaker is chosen according to the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog box .
use these buttons to store or load your spokes@@ person , or delete all settings too .
the spokes@@ person filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if apply . you must apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can give their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the language S@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts can use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; D ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the VO API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned voice @-@ minded language supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ ed filter furnished , but when using the module for the festival , websites are not read .
caused by an error at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you will have to do yourself if you do not use this voice to read out web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that entire sentences are out@@ stri@@ pped or only che@@ ering @-@ wave . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure that the check@@ coding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be solved by a character set filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with each language synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of languages above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . also look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice @-@ Organ@@ izer . if you want to bro@@ aden your use of another synthes@@ izer , get in touch with the developer team .
the program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; however , it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment from KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the package c@@ els and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you want to download the source code from the source archive or downloaded from the source archive , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball up each night , then install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your Language @-@ organizer . to do this , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ trans@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; used to develop the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program ect@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be further developed , that the installation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
a long text will be sm@@ elled in individual phrases . the user can repeat pun@@ ctu@@ ation or deriv@@ ative double , repeat the output stop or break down .
if an application notes text on &amp; kt@@ on ; there is an application for example . if you have appointed a speaker , whose language English and whose sex is feminine , this may be used , otherwise the best suited speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker , you see in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add Spe@@ ech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker , and clicking on Edit , the mapping card reader is displayed . as an example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . as an example , you will find details on the modules for the interactive diagram . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text , which is delivered to the festival . in votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; are known , this setting will automatically be made . generally , the Western languages apply ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use eastern languages like Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , add volume , speech speed and audio @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ator and displayed this grey , the voice you choose will not be chosen .
some votes such as multi @-@ Syrian voices will require more seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this crossing field , these voices are already loaded to the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first movement will be synthes@@ ized more quickly .
if this cross @-@ field may not be selected , you have not yet appointed a spokes@@ man ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this entry box is marked , at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ al code appears . otherwise , after starting only the icon t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this entry marks marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the opportunity to stop reading or to control otherwise .
here are all orders placed in the queue , along with the application which has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of phrases and the straight @-@ worked proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the speaker card .
with buttons in this series you can fill in a row in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also taken on the other car@@ dinal maps ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . click on this symbol to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ ha@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the mapping card . see also .
here are only text orders listed and managed . expenses of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information on the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the corresponding audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if a stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ d is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no initial module is displayed on the list , you must install at least one module . have to select Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M unit . see also
make the consultation speed here one . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ bet ; % roughly the double normal consultation speed . so that these settings may be implemented , the program has to be so@@ x installed .
click on users to take the new settings for the running &amp; desktop system .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules which are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you must yourself find out which device works by you . in doubt you choose default .
on this map menu you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is pres@@ umed to all other orders and keeps these orders . after reading the output of the screen reader , the recorded orders will be re @-@ recorded .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
breaking news have the next priority . a message breaks down normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can contact &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , welcome someone who just enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output in the queue is a text .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are valid only for normal text contracts . for messages , warnings and issues of screen readers do not exist any special promotions , if this will be interrupted by a message with higher priority .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume of voice and pitch . additionally , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation by e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ id XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently support &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound base in the Festival config dialog is not based on 100@@ nbsp ; % set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous spoken .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and satellite filters . this may also begin reading text in individual phrases . this allows you to synthes@@ ize faster , not the entire text order . thus , you can also pre @-@ jump or stop or stop and break down , even if the voice of speech does not directly support this .
here you can see the Sat@@ z@@ limit@@ less recognizable filter . at the first time , a satellite @-@ bound@@ ing filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add additional pre@@ dict@@ ation filter to beginners , but beg@@ inner but it will get off .
most of the easiest way to learn the furnishings of the spokes@@ person by trying out . turn the Spre@@ ader selection , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose the spokes@@ person again , change the speaker . to do so , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then quick to start reading , since only the first sentence has to be processed , and not the entire text block , which can take a long time .
you can then hold text orders on the mapping or break down , even if the voice @-@ organizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal set @-@ limits filter is automatically set up when you launch t@@ sm@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . he cannot be switched off , just be removed . change nothing on this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
character@@ ization filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the Sat@@ anic characters ( dec@@ imal scales ) before the filtering automatically from the text ) . note that the standard character@@ ization filter is attached .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ icks ) , warnings , messages or the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ ics .
if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal z@@ limit@@ less recognizable filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the mapping menu speaker , you can write the spokes@@ person for the application . the mapping card is displayed , if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the car@@ tei@@ es speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are determined .
use of the most suitable intercom , which displays all the properties of a fully equipped intercom . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom or edit , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise choosing &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who most likely matches the properties set up .
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties , clicking on one of the choices .
select the features of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything .
highlight this stimulation if the property is supposed to be prec@@ e@@ dence over other properties . you can also put multiple mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , this feature is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language is ahead , if you know that a specific application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to test all properties in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the selection button to use standard speaker , and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 points for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is the entry 0 required ) .

the settings for the rate speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; html .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the festival . would you like to read websites before , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the administration of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called through the menu of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; G@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to enable the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; appears . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choice of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network networking settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and adjustment of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices have been added later , the driver must be loaded through adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel release :
the network settings is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the truste@@ e choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release are best matches . by selecting the setting no @-@ once again the definition can be hit permanently . in the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . before , all options are gray only , which means settings can only be considered . in the system administration mode , you can access by clicking the button &apos; button &apos; mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used for managing the network equipment of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
you can set settings in setting network interfaces through choice of the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface . it will set up in a dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below to display the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ ev@@ ed from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ O or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
by selecting manu@@ ell can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP / TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the TCP / IP address is set to specify .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values shown in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping at the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . turn off a tra@@ ded network unit , from the list and click on the interface .
network units can be activated or switched on as required . switch off an activated network unit , from the list and click of the interface .
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be built on the net , in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain address by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers only request IP addresses . if the computer is htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS triggers this name to an IP address , such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the host to nam@@ ing part of the Re@@ ti@@ te name solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed , or modified .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a choice and execution or dem@@ otion in the list with buttons , or possessions placed in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add Fol@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed in the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry then will be added in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator , select a record and then click on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialogue is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list specifically known calcul@@ ator describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used at bo@@ oting if no DNS server is available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list specifically includes some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . still in the test , the version of IP aims to replace 4 in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The dialog &apos;s New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known host and click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known computer has several ali@@ ases , press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and enter the other ali@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a name of a specific machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialogue of your computer will be displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , it must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm package ) is sufficient , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t have been installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s just download the r@@ pm package and at a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical surface like a package or the installation tool for your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second part all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file will be discussed .
this section can not replace more detailed knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is introduced into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to penetrate this description in the near future . this description focuses therefore on the IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact point provided that a valid IP address is provided or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . definitely , the IP address can not be chosen easily !
when setting up a dedicated small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses in the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so their any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
additionally , the ma@@ har@@ ness is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0 ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = one &apos;s own computer ) . the standard route is required for the IP @-@ forwar@@ ding .
the power station 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this section the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is set to be set there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand as expected can therefore occur .

for a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and under description appears disabled .
the ambient variables listed here are the otherwise existing environment variables for all specified tasks except strength . in a de@@ activated variable it appears as a description disabled .
to create a new task , select first the tasks -@@ folders . then proceed in the menu to Edit New .... Of course , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and then select from the context @-@ click menu new ... or C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the fixed programme . you can either specify a relative or absolute name . if you want to search the program first , press Cho@@ ose ...
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can indicate the minutes in five @-@ way steps .
if you select both Mon@@ thly Day ( e ) as well as week@@ days ( e ) , the task will be executed on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will run independently of the week@@ day , and on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall .
as with creating new tasks , changes will only be active when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored .
to cut a task , they first select the task to be removed . go to Edi@@ ting .
alternatively , you can click on the task and select it , or push C@@ tr@@ l ; X .
to copy a task , first select the task to copy . go to Edit Cop@@ y .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select Cop@@ y , or push C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to add a task , must first be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board first . only then , inser@@ ting the tasks -@@ folders to . go then to Edit Past@@ ing .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task of selecting and paste , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; V .
in order to make changes to a task , select first one . go to the menu item Edit ...
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and change ... select it , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog task in which you can edit , as described above , able to edit the chosen task .
to clear a task , select the task to delete , then proceed to the menu item Edit .
to enable or disable a task , select it and determine the condition with the menu item editing . in@@ active tasks are marked in their description with in@@ active .
alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and then select Stock Exchange . check out the activation that program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly .
to run a task immediately , select this and go to Edit Now .
to create a new environment variable , select first the variable -@@ folders . go to menu Edit New ....
alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button on the variable folder and select New ... or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
type the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable score . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the program to another as the normal address
as in creating new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored .
to cut a variable , first select the variable variation . go then to Edi@@ ting .
to copy a ambient variable , select first the too copied Vari@@ able . go then to Edit Cop@@ y .
alternatively , you can click on the variable and select Cop@@ y , or push C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to add a environment variable , first it must be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then the option is paste at all . select the variable -@@ folders to . go then to Edit Past@@ ing .
to change a variable , select first the variable variable from . go then to edit ... alternative you can edit with the right mouse button on the variable and changing ... or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable .
to delete a ambient variable , select first the variable . go then to Edit delete .
to enable or disable a environment variable , select it and place the condition with the menu item Comple@@ te . if a de@@ activated variable appears under description De@@ activated .
alternatively , you can also click the variable and then select the variable with the right mouse button . check that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and ambient variables were entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item Store .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . change or supplements to tasks or variables are only then active .
it appears the standard k@@ de ; press dialog . if you choose to fold out , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the dialog dialog box .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only for users who own advanced privileges .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie cr@@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules the users .
a P@@ OS@@ IX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to experience time and date .
&amp; Do : is a backup program for band screens on the basis of tar . it provides the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; Do ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; Do ; sp@@ ult the band back and read the pres@@ ch@@ less information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; Do ; the accus@@ ation on the band doesn &apos;t , you are asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
recognis@@ ing &amp; Do ; the accus@@ ation , it searches for the appropriate index on your plate . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ generated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the band &apos;s band changes in order to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched for the tape &apos;s term .
before leaving the bank , first of all the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; nbsp ; returns with a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration of the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without danger .
before a volume of &amp; c@@ date ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; Do .
a band @-@ types need to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure doesn &apos;t need to format@@ ting the format before you are format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; Do . flo@@ ppy disk drives tend to be format@@ ting of the tape advance , DA@@ T drives , however , not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; c@@ date ; with the format@@ ting of the belt . all the data on the tape will be lost ! after finishing the process procedure , the volume will be automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you to@@ ast the backup process , you need to select the backup files you need . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree ; it is only stored in this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profiles are secured .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Fol@@ ders menu ...
once the backup is started , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check back the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the safety process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder are checked .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the exam has been started , the dialog preferences for review . in this dialog you can check once again your choice and change the folder for viewing .
if you have confirmed the settings for veri@@ fying , the dialog appears to review . this dialog shows the progress of the process of testing as well as the data exchange and the remaining time .
before you enter the Rest@@ ore , the files need to be recovered , be checked . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives files to the belt drive . it is only restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the requested files from one of the archives with a h@@ ooks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu again ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog preferences for recovery . in this dialog you can check once again your choice and change the folder level for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoring it , the dialog appears re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data exchange and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file with the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is created a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder in which the backup should be done . the list of native files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders , which are listed under backup files , the files only contain files that are stored on the same fil@@ es@@ ystem , as the folder . folder , which lie on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can apply separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be saved and a new snapshot is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons are set ; and lt ; and , files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the menu settings , you can make the following settings :
the full path to device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ modeling option of the band@@ man .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; backup ; before the tape is bound , the command gets load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or ty@@ co@@ operations .
is the option turned on , try &amp; Do ; to block the throw at the belt drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all band@@ man works .
if the option is switched on , the loos@@ ening of the incorpor@@ ation of &amp; f @-@ date ; automatically the belt is ch@@ opped . use this option not with flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers .
is the option turned on , try &amp; deny ; the hard@@ disks are able to change variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you have to say &amp; backup ; in any case the block@@ size for your band &apos;s drive will communicate .
if &amp; Do ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file will be composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , whereby hosts the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ file folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that let themselves be directly connected to &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup program . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; the program is suitable for system protocols . the program is accessible for in@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users support quick access to the example of information on issues that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users support quick access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.@@ has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other features are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the screen@@ shot of the screen@@ shot , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; features are available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the system of system log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol is not displayed , and it opens up instead of its small message window , so you have &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very likely will not be executed with system managers . the protocol files typically find in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selection crit@@ erion or after a string . the list of log files will now be displayed automatically , so that only the log @-@ line contains the entry for the selected filter . then a protocol line contains only shown if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
here you can also select another entry . the string string of the filter search will be selected only with the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol column , select the name of a process , so shows you &amp; utility log ; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a show@@ y color as protocol lines of the level note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off dialog .
do you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can trace the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Next &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option to display new lines in the context menu of the main window in order to display all the new added protocol lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find further current information on the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; nbsp ; log ; also find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; sub@@ version Archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more well @-@ known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for monitoring the program starts at the flood of the system in the &amp; Linux world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time it is more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without making a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start when driving the system or switching to another round level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ ters , which will only once run . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , even if there are actually not much use of it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ an in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run out a bit , what has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the standard Run@@ time is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line in the initial area as the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column , and you will probably find that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have a mistake , then you will be repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the proper scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that no real files are located in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? simply : any of the scripts is written so it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name and when the one is included , the script is called with the argument stop . if he contains a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set themselves a simple way of building machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level , which is only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , in addition , I could have a user @-@ running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another hand device is simple to fail to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of avail@@ able system services to one of the six rounds to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . besides , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ time ( or its location ) . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the field of availability system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to select them merely on a new run@@ way , you need to explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the number of entries from one item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the Sor@@ rows of the surrounding entries before you can try again to submit the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore data , which were thrown in the trash . be therefore cautious .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another round level , move it with out @-@ cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired running level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the number of goods or the name of an item manually , press the button button to switch between different fields . simply close the dialog by pressing a button to accept the changes , or push Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before it will be executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts anew . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have set some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you must edit any extra files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual after .
the way for system services can be launched in these distri@@ butions , does not simplify the configuration of the proprietary programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just quit without a message if its configuration files are not present or wron@@ g@@ ly furnished .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; user user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
once you have made changes , you must save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry / save in the menu .
&amp; G@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two mapping cards , the user and user support list . to edit the user &apos;s desired users or the required group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user account and group features .
some mapping cards are only represented if you have made advanced system settings . only if you have space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a mapping card will be created , where you can make individual settings , if shadow - passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like being installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces .
the mapping administration is published if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like being installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces .
this be@@ holder will only appear if it is activated and initi@@ alized for at least a one @-@ time fil@@ es@@ ystem ( Qu@@ ota ) file and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , for each user parameter changes , the space restrictions are always in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for any fil@@ es@@ ystem . the current file system is selected using the fil@@ es@@ ystem path using space restrictions .
the mapping group informs about the group activity of the chosen user . the standard group , which the user belongs , you will find in the field primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s Properties contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or group , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the user &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; user &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu or click on the right button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or del@@ eting of the selected user or the selected group is similar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO &apos;s System , remove the boot password , remove and modify the time up to the boats of the standard system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , modify , modify and more .
