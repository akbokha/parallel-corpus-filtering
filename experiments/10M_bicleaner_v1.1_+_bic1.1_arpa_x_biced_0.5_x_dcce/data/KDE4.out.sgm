<seg id="1">You can translate the website website in the "Konqueror; -menu under extras. select from the list below the source and target language of translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is in place of the whole & URL; translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. baboufish produced in the best case a crude translation and in worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the babelfish page, where you can insert your texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & Konqueror; in spite of their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions by & Konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about using & Conqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual too & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Konqueror; choose settings extensions... open the mapping software tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard deposit modules from the package kde; add-ons. please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have any additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package base, the & Conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & Konqueror; on extras. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror; to the crash, or the list of abducts if available, extinguish.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module dedicated Filters (also called Folder filter) in the & Konqueror; Menu, under extras. with the module, you can filter up-to-date subdirectory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM construction view in & Konqueror; use extras DOM tree to display... and thus open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root elements of the document, for example: the element, all other nodes are underelements of this root.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the mime type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different tooling and text views in order to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of portrayte folder-hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle, its surface is proportionate to its size. this size must possess that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected, if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, FSView can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treatmap representation constitutes a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, you possess the right corner of meaningful colours and caption settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched via view mode, can be either very deep for the slight recognition of the casings, or the illustration of a different file, such as name, owner, group or mime type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or the folder. for each property you can specify, if enough space to display is present or if the area of subordinate rectangle may be used (where hence, display errors can be made by limitations in the sign-map). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the marking in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">On display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule is not always observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entries. at the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always kept. there are limits to the tightening of the entries. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangular square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of a contract for subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is for the labeled and avoidance of space loss through frames always advantageous the surface to be made up as square. the best methods in this are lines, columns or recursive grading.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimalist area for an entry over the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern in the area of the superior item is drawn to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget, which was developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module gallery can be found in the & Konqueror; menu under extras,... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also check out the publication; homepage to receive news on shared releases and other information about & checking;</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to take part on & checking; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. guidance on arrival in the developer mailing list of & checking came;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you have arrived; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. you can simply specify a local, remote or remotely folder. simply enter Padding names or click on the folder icon in order to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data collection is stored for all images.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & Thank you; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings will be set up.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you have already a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the pictures can specify as a base folder. at this time, each subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. during the passage of the folder you get a step indication of how to see this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitization; durably capturing the librad in its whole depth. you cannot exclude any subfolder, unless it iste into hiding folder. this can take you exceptionally, by taking a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder of photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not take photos as symbols. you can take the changes by taking any sort of photo from the album and put this on the folder symbol. further details can be found in the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you configure the root folder, you can set up & checking; your digital camera set up. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and My keywords, to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then also appears as a USB mass storage device. the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitization; used the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images of digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. because photos in general are large files and transmissions on the serial port, this connection has been outdated. & nbsp; supports these cameras and introduces the transmission of pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphotographs 2 must have been created with libexif support to read the thumbnail shots. if the EXIF support is not available in libgami2, you might not be able to stand backstage or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things there has been checking out is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modul structure, KPhotoalbum, Showigs and Gwenview. goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it's much easier to complete, checking out; by writing a small module to complete a function as the changes occurred in & checking; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the margins with & LMB; remove or switch to full-screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and discard images will work anywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the Albentree, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture does not occur in keywords, date list or search.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata products are provided in accordance with your definition, provide information on or documentation of other data created by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you don't even know how 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't want to have a certain photo.. the approach to save metadata both in a database and in the images guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before doing anything in your system is to build up information structure in contrast to data structure. you must decide if other access to your photos are to be stored on your computer or on a network drive, etc; note that you will have to change on a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly find out about your location. the remaining photos will be organized on the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders inas & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers can have other requirements, such as publishers, archiving, work processes, constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% Archive and 5% files have to be organized and you will not want to reorganise your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking process easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and the migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store the metadata page in the file content page. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget it, then you can subsequently store the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the item's menu item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what is going to change? you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, and these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you now need any photo keywords, captions and evaluation. of course, you can select all the images, which need the same attribute and then set the value. it is best to start with the review or the ranking. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the further work on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently lodge in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import cataloised images from another source using embedded keywords, then it will then change the tree for you and paste the pictures to the right place. the soreness of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by taking a subtree to another. the changed keywords will be monitored by & checking; updated while it is the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata reproduces. this is a very rough representation, since every block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. data stream and calendar dates can be found in all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to cataloise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want most anyone want to let your photos just see, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos are arriving.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that is the landing stage of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Revolution the 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time is back present, you may even hear the silence. thus, your perception of this panoramas completely changed.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help Him learn about the motif you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work alone with a caption for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & B, you can use any number of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE is even exported to you for a selection of pictures. you will have to tell you a spelling for your wishes in the marking and / or the title of the web server system. so you have to tell the story for the opening hours no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation is already with speed speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of geolocalisation are already innumerable and will continue in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also open your trips with Google Earth. this then shows the photos on the reception. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the googlemaps to export.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a game of copyright and describes the practice to use copyright law to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms should also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information came out of the layout page, which should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and writers): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organisation. after which this value was saved, it should not be changed any longer. this field does not support Commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the working name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: Anclerk photographer, freelance photographer or Independent photographer. since this is a comment on the author's field, this must be filled out as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who the photo offers. this should not necessarily be the author. if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the image is a warehouse photo, the group / Agency lists the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers may delete or change the solution to this problem. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermarks is unique per image. & digitization; will provide such a module for the stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: panel error, blackout, clashes, ECC, transmission defect, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasteration, life time, temperature, data-proof superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper-photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data reorganization in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be handled these predictated and you can no longer think than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs within archiving quality. there are offers about gold piled DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe that is in your surveroom.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can store good disks and good reception equipment and keep them in the right way. the best DVD reception tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to defects even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. therefore, use 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and controlling light, scratches light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which seems to work with Windows and & Linux. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppies, harddisks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Discs appear to save the Former War against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus nearly sixty-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good reception device on high quality media in a non-propriocative format. afterwards, read the media with a description, date & author label and then stored on a clean, dark-dry and before animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturer keeps your statistics for itself. your manufacturing company will include a new disk, but not the data. Google puts on this topic a large field study on the error-mechanisms of hard drives: disinframe</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: Disks hold on the longest if you are operated in the temperament of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. electronic components of the controller are the most common error-purpose, SMART can not notice this error. some of the SMART claims are the most immediate effect. these are especially lesbian and publishing enumerations. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss process because of overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power if you have secured the files, but those losses usually can be produced without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical appliances do not account much, that is different from devices with computer chips and high speed processors differently. these can cause serious harm. at your computer, these abnormalities, complete data loss, hardware switch, destructive motherboard and other defects can result. protect yourself in front of the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against rapins is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy-heat and observes the rest. it is usually available in the form of a steckerbar. but remember that not every steckerchief contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it offers protection against lightening and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because an overvoltage each cable can use to your computer, you should be sure that also all peripherals devices are attached to your computer. this also applies to telephonors and cable modems that also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have an ebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects your system before smaller variations in the electricity lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even an emergency of few seconds may result in loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in a sub-breaking power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power cut occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the power is running. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the life time of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern yourself at the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety at the cost of avoiding this. a high quality assurance protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are high priced compared to the hard drives, although very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local loss of data. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution Online. the professional version makes you more available, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for 25 $per year you get unrestricted memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data security, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatic thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desastersecure.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and bumps provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection within your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable grid parts are another source of transmission losses since they generate interference within the data flow. if normal filesystems this error remains unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to behave in low levels and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL-compatible license for Solaris and leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon also for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btration filesystem. this is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms the zfs used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss loss in the notebook and 46% in the job systems. in notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most seas. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to loss of data as proprietary Systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, Exit, JFS and XFS, to call the common file systems. a very good English article here can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data: wrongly, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status will be avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the major contributors for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture framing of fundamental physical boundaries. meant that while the technology is developing further there is a natural border for that progress. sensitivity and smoking characteristics are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk will get you today for 100 & euro. so do not make anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a Plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstall of your OS, the exchange of records or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external drive on an external drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster hits locally and destroys a lot. do you forget air products: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, Desaster prevention means not a local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up. it is a snapshot of the history of a snapshot, and it represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference backup: a backup of the files that have been changed for the past year. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differentials.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates the original status at any time when such a backup was made. this backup comes from a versioning system next to the exception which is only cleared and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to Script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions, only the difference of the files really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security above ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file (IP) information, original XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, refind images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 years, that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature is unpredictable, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and reevaluate each other while the time passes. unfortunately, there is no other option than a certain vigilance to leave. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is downward compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the question of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system, that reading your pictures is important, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means constantly growing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you plan the scalability with you and enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy to this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd / dev / sdb # source is / dev / sdb # source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; the new record is / dev / sdc1 0; resiza / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reesopfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary format that is slowly falling from the market. so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard designed to replace the GIF. however, it can save XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG used it requires lots of administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and have a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression-fixing plug (deflate). a problem is however, that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a licensed free and open air-format designed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handhandful of camera pers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, to replace Adobe its XML based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is an extension of XML and quot; .xls; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the shell format. XMP fits in, since it saves the metadata separately from the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw-format is verted. therefore, you should think if you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports its fully compatible online metadata to support the work of DCMI and DCMI's work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the dealer or the scanner. as long as the images on cameredium are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this function has not yet been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine editing, you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & checking; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under certain programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them first into web galleries, add them to MPEG, you use in contact leaves, print you & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & checking; in the section Add a photo to an album, you can add photos, which you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To convert your digital camera with & checking, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode, and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, this tries to connect with your camera. for some cameras, you can take a while. if this is the case, the filenames appears and a symbol for the file order for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the page's features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a one or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays files properties and the photographic information that can be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not provide all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. the image. this information is the same as when the metadata page came from the main window of & checking; or the picture editing. please note that these metadata with some digital cameras are not available.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos of her camera into a single album.. downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard optional methods from & kde. as soon as you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download the chosen item. the button to download is so long until you selected some pictures selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is new to download. these pictures were not recorded until now. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview display. if you choose this option, you will of course only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons All download or select the chosen item, appears a dialog, with which you can choose the target album. the list of existing albums is displayed as a normal folder. details about the folder you can read in the section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and checking out; the pictures from the camera invites you to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once, by checking the button delete All. if you only want to delete some, you need to select it first and then delete the selected information.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility there are photos that you deleted from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & kde; so you should carefully check if the pictures have been removed successfully in the camera. if you do not want to delete them from the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are normally used again after the pictures are deleted from the camera. therefore, it can be reasonable, the date and time when the image was made to integrate in the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and splash of the image and for datalogous subscribers. if you use this last option, a folder per day is automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options on the transmission opens up three more options that are performed before the photos on the disk will be stored. if you choose this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want to use a different date format than standard format, you can e.g. use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% N% H:% S:% S. turn the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command stringtime.</seg>
<seg id="265">When you use the camera file name, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase letters. or in case letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which has been checking, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera display next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">After checking out, all the information about the orientation of the camera can be used at the time of downloading. not all cameras get this information ready. in the section page bar metadata, you can read further details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, leaves you release, the photo in its original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic rotation, use the button Advanced and choose Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera is provided with information about the date when the photo was made, it may be charged. these sub-files are downloaded on the image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same underalbum. in the section page bar Meta data you can read out which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case resumes, checking the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change it, you have to use this option. use the button Advanced and select the option of File-based submites at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from her computer to her camera is the button. select then upload. the file server dialog box; appears in which you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, ask & checking; you, where the images will be uploaded. a folder-selection dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term used in this document. thus, a position that is stated in the latitude and latitude, and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to simulate an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmenter, military, police, architectural offices and real estate brokers can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was taken, you can access a browser which indicates the area. if you want to post a postcard to another, or simply want to document this aspect, it's good to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 has been supported in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, about a post-editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera, which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS recipients. either as a map module or through the transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-interface: CoyoteEye EVAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and the GPS and can correlate it. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or psPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudinal and other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accid coordinates, which can be created e.g. by mapS.google.</seg>

<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color formations. please refer to this article in Wikipedia to the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG used a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. thereby 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files compress you can switch the Deflate Compressionists for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the deflate algorithm is working out.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of losses of JPEG-2000 files you can also save losses. even if you have been written down the loss of loss, the relation between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digitization, the image processing was only an image asset for photos. currently, it is rapidly developing a tool for manipulation your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default gain is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option if you use this option with minimal loss of details. this option makes the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white-off the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not set off. standard is to use a solid color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that belated images in four steps get more details in the hairpin. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the nickname, so the parts of your images are burned-in, due to the incapacity of your camera to view the hairline. the setting colors will trigger some fancy results, since they display the hairline in different Roskilns. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the hairpin.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixel has generally not become so fast soaked like green and red. therefore, and dcraw are trying to reconstruct the missing green- and red-shares from the still unsaturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question how much color or what you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminanzvalue according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the picture options offered. to keep the time for the humiliation small, you should take conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demoskeletal algorithm is a digital image process to compose a complete image from the sub-filtered image, which provides many cameras and which makes a matrix color-like pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbredesign.</seg>
<seg id="310">After checking, and Dcraw present you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation (Variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color-facet at the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color grazing of your lentils you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you are carried out during the raw material.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color formations and there are instructions how they are to be given again. there are also LCMS and checking; information such as the color formations were translated into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Conduct issues when a picture opens in the image editing, the file-administration module will start with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setting the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & nbsp; examines this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour-government view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are colorfully not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit into the camera and model that you are using. not all profiles are included in the same way. currently, there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color or gamma correctly. currently, dcraw Gamma does not have to perform for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof Profile, which you can emulate on how your image could be given from one device. this is very useful before you print picture, as your printer has a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore can function very saturated with you. this could you manually correct it instead of leaving the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that what color profile is planned for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together. this answer is obviously inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style of the target: F for an accurate style, L for Neutral, P for portraits, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image concerned and image editing; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use, and these will then be charged by checking; loaded. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the thumbnail.</seg>

<seg id="325">The settings of the Slideshow should be easy to understand. the upper controller carries the time between the image outputs, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other illiterations turn on the metadata, which ends at the lower end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all available cameras on the left-hand side. on the right side there is a button Automatic detection, which is trying to use the camera properly, switched on and in the image gallery. currently, here are principled, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage devices.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camaliste. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnsible, specify on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To convert your digital camera with & checking, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Just try out if it came and checking; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera odell and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera; it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of confirmation dialog for relocating &gt; pictures in the dustbin, you can adjust the interlocuteness of a photo. in the deletion of a photos and deleting an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right side bar, tacit by & digitization; be applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without delay. otherwise, you will need to apply changes to the button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also refrain from checking the welcome screen from & checking; at Starlinger, this accelerates the starting order from checking;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting starts looking for new photos and has been allowed to search for new, deleted albums / photos. this has lengthened the time folder after new or deleted albums / photos. if something was deleted from the base folder, asks, checking, whether it should delete them from the base folder.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color-schemas can be used in & checking; used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes. these settings can be displayed under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for checking, you will find further information about it in this tutorial.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules included, so you may not be part of your distribution. other information on the KIPI modules can be found in the section image editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current data number, enlarging factor and the current size picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and including the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing alter your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file. save the original shot from the toolbar. note that you cannot restore the original photo as soon as you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly install a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save it off file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you do not have saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or using the button Restore Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of the picture editing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo back by selecting Editing regresale or restored by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should do the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to the back catchy and remake Ctrl; -Shift-Z for reproducing.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB for a moment in the toolbar, you can press a right click menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed, either undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the image editing, you can move between photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation button in the toolbar, image high, picture or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current picture, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo and get out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse-wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Passenger menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlargement factor automatically choose</seg>
<seg id="350">Full screen mode is displayed in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Escape key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can change this in the site dialog by & checking; change. you can view this from the layout page. see the section on setting up the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print directly in the menu image and get the default & kde; printed dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases. you'll need to select just the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu item exporters button. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The menu came; the main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same page bar is available, without the navigational shells, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five horsetail is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multi-roof clicked on the same rider leaves the sidebar appear and disappear again in the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the description, you can enter or insert signages with unlimited size. that means that all special characters are allowed. the marking are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and are shaped. if you want to use the IPTC signment field in other applications, you should be aware of these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, you either use the button application or simply switch to the next picture, the captions are stored then.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button free. with this you can write further metadata from the selected file or database. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review assessment shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting. it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. the coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sampling map shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords, and a selection box with the previously included in this & publication; -session included.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword will be dynamically adapted to the search term. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is further relief when entering keywords at a picture series. if you typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed by flagging of the appropriate attachments in the tree. all tags of an image are stored into the IPTC-field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword menu, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to add a sample with a keyword, please read the keywords section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar code filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, keyword and viewpoints. if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side, only the interface of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw on tags and discard. suppose you have already selected several pictures in the main view. if the keywords already existed, you can easily drag it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. thereupon, a dialog, which you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the sampling filter is reduced to No keywords, which is the quantity to three pictures. they were chosen with Strg + a, and afterwards a keyword was drawn out of the right sample-tree on the selection and sat there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at each start of the program. it can also be switched under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry where is looked for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keywords, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3) The argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the cross-box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options are then as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I made it mainly for checking; S concrete implementation was adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorfully-managed workflow that is the colours available from your camera or scanner. with a colorfully serviced workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web made of your Digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it must answer for the results he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on colour management. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions in order to obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria specified below, you do not have to worry about paint-management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour pattern. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other figures are by E-Mail or the Web, where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So when SGB works so well and life is so easy for everybody to do so, why should you use another color space and therefore have to worry about color managers?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB Farms, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to collect my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB Farms?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in RGB Farms or not, you need to monitor your monitor that you; onization on sRGB, therefore, closes the circle. if you are working as the CGB of sRGB, you need to use either your monitor on the RGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automatic, and contrast expand from the menu Correction Automatic correction are automatically trying to make the best of your colours. you will need to experiment with these effects, to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values about the whole image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shades. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method jushes the illuminance factor of the colours of the selected image so that the histogram of the Intensity area is as flat as possible. sometimes the final very good results in improving the contraction of an image, sometimes it produces just rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which occurs either in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic Absame: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green- and blue-channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and jushes the red, green- and blueberry channels to complete histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast, this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest levels of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off from checking came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a single photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly limited than using 8-bit per colour. in case you can operate too far from the original image, if you can perform the white-off mode in the shell mode, which works in the 16-bit mode, then your ways of correction are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salvist of copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white-off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window display can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see the original image as well as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original white-picture again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target room has a red marker. the luminance of the pixl under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is displayed as soon as you change one parameter. this histogram is very helpful as, even in well-lighted images, most pixels with very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is shown. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, satiation and gamma. the shade of adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also periodically.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the checks on the above run, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere to the picture show around which to use selected color for the calculation of color temperature of the white contrast. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the whiteboard with the list of preference settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The Overview indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel is overexposed. they will appear the combined result in the white-screen. this is seen in the preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons store as well as loading accurately this. each setting of the white, which you have set, you can save it in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings returns all the filter values back to its default values and the net neutrality. keep in mind that even neutral settings will be another photo than your original. if you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoders per colour-channel of the edited image. 8-Bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, processing time and stands onlyfor the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be drawn in the chapter administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under matching colours correctly. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same error, so you can always find the same correction. in the manual for sound corrections you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The result came; tool Foot effects presents you four coloured effects, a solar energy effect, a neon-effect and a cannon filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, solar isation, also called Sabatians, was an effect of the created light. the colored, dark areas sheltered from the extra light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool was a partial negativity of the picture. this tool allows you to nug this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image illustrates what is chemically possible. an additional boost ultimately generates a negative image that is not to produce at photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy effect. the original image is (1) and it is processed (2). the intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation thus that it makes a stronger contradiction, which makes the colors brilliant and glatching. try it simple, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for one on daylight flipped color movie made by the Japanese company Fujimovie. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography. Velvias strongly saturated color but also some photo photographers, especially those who are barely given landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasting channels. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slips reps the strength of the Neonlight. at large pictures, the filter can expel the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and the luminosity of your photos. all your adjustment can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the results you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too large satiation. also in this case the tool for brightness / satiation will reduce a good choice for satiety instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool grades and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma is the tool for key correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need for the explained application purpose only the area of the slider. concrete the three sliders below the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains an graphene of the Intensity values, a histogram, of active canals or the selected range. under the graphene are three sliders into it and they can move to change the Intensity of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to move the regulator and to make sure how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic utility is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top one for the dark notes, the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes, often called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color shades can be used in the preview of the original image, to automatically adjust the input holes of the shadow, middle and bright notes automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit: the excerpts permits the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators used to modify the exit status, for example, use the compression rate can be used for example, to create a hidden image as a background to see something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the images are automatically set to dependence on the intention of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: using these buttons, the used values can be stored in the filesystem and later loading again. the Gimp level is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color shades, the input provides automatically for all shadows, resources and sun-tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original hologame for rotor, green-, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overloaded indexes controls all color channels to display superior pixel and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha canal, as well as the excerpts are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview is dynamically based on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that changes from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful mode. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you postpone a Kurventeil to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright notes with darker excerpt and that the image pixel will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the field you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve, showing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is placed to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: using these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you can create it can be stored in the filesystem and later loading. the file format is that Gimp is short-format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you set this method and the three color shades, automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun-tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the checkpoints for the rottle, green-, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overloaded indeer-indicator controls all color channels to display superior pixel. if in more than one channel overloaded pixel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in Luminanzas. shadow - and sun-tones was placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Canal-Mixer der & digitization; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Canal-Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the canaloptionally you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window displays a preview. the original can be seen in comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to blend this channels even if you change the appropriate color components, since the channel mixer then is the tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible ruff which does not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose smoking pattern can be different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion thereby by reducing the color pattern first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender settings can thus save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mode.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overloaded indexes controls all color channels to display superior pixel and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in the blue channel again and the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step, because color images can easily converged on the computer. also, with a set of film rollerprofiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Grünfilter: simulates a black / white footage with a green liner filter. this looks good at all scene images and fit especially well to portraits against the sky. so similarly to the 004 Cokin (tm) Grünfilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfilmed: simulates a black / white footage with a orange filter shaded. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similarly to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filth.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotetfilter: simulates a black / white film overload with a red liner filter. this creates dramatic trends-effects and can simulate lunar yeast to day-time. thus, similarly to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotate.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white footage with a yellow liner filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones, while it adds a bit cold in the loop of a pressure and the redevelopment of an epiphoner. this is typical for the photos of your Grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the translation came; tool texture you can apply decorative textures in an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, irrespective of whether it's a color image or not, you can look it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the thrust of an old master, a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or like a wall-screen on a wall. the menu entry image texture apply to image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the semblance of the deep or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textile effect is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digitization; tool frames can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photos is no easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the strewn eye. under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you provide the desired type of cream for your image. going through the picture with a thin line, Niepce around it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone-shift and decorative brush adds a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: prints the width of the frame in percent. value range for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image combined with the box will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially when you cut off the tool after page ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any spot. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it using the mouse. use text output, orientation, color out of the color pattern and the character set with its characteristics as you need. you'll just select a frame round the text and / or a half-sighted background. already the picture is done.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you choose for your text can change until you hit the button "OK." after the picture has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the checking out; tool stencil, you can apply a stencil over one image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Tablone menu apply in image processing can be used to put stencils over one image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to the reduction of file size of the template; just send an e-mail in English to checking; mailinglist came checking-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you must set your template folder with the 'root folder' folder. select the folder in which you have copied the template folder. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root-level has been set for the stencils, a subview reflects the folder structure of the Schablonenordners. selecting a folder is updated the thumbnail of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifier factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button magnifies the picture shown in this button. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Downsized: this button shrinks the underlying picture. if you want to apply the mouse button on the whole image, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below to the template. take the picture and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Ok, if you want to apply the stencil to your image, then the image becomes automatic of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="479">Checking out; poses three different tools to acuteness. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for cutting. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, granny images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurredness mask works at the contrast of edges to make an image sharpest. actually, it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric perst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really enhances the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most of the digitalized images need a correction to the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color together. this, in turn, results in a common color together. the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more acuation than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images, a camera is often used internally. images in the raw-format against it must always be piled up during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner already use a sharpness filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by raising a photo with the edge-train system. this allows you to notify you with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should keep careful but careful, as the results are not very natural: the sharpest technique increases the edge of edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpens up a picture the tool refocus. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpens up.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is considerably easier than it sharpens. use the tool to shape softening with the menu entry, and experiment with settings. the window box on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help edit the image. this window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often create good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurredness mask too strongly, noise and impression of grats will produce sharp in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a guns are affected by the filter. therefore, high-resolution images allow greater radios. therefore you should see pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image one of the original is added. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable differential amount. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpenalties are exempt and therefore better errors in faces, heavenly and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The ship came; tool refocus refocused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyright protected filter -algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo an image to & quot; refocused voicing; in which it's a better approach than just trying to raise the picture. refocus can usually start better results than blurred mask. refocus can usually start from the menu by calling on colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung works much better than the Gauß'sche fission. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the source pixel, which depends far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß 'Faltung is influenced in most cases very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focal length: this is the radius of circular fission. it is the main parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the standard value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, then it should be considered to be halted.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help artefacts. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Robatic filters: an increase in the drug filter can help you artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the drug filter is too low, & eg. 0 is the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will continue the picture further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche shark. this is most commonly caused by a previously-led thread. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal null, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the drugs filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenge size: this value determines the size of the transationsmatrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for bullring depth or the gauze's sharpness. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for that parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the area of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters that you have set will thus be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and intensity control on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible are perform, but leave behind unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read and compress images, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than acuteness. this might thereby be caused to use the unsharp masking a larger neighbourhood as acuteness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the FIR filter. practical, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the sharpest mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color pattern can be corrected. this picture has been made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficiently light to auto-focus lenses.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of acamping corrections in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Regulators Trotte puts the blurredness of the area of the dark-dark, in order to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tints allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool infallibility is one of the most highly developed tool to remove the desired artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm has been developed by the image team of the REC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the horsepower smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a little value leads to a equated smoothing over the picture. woing against larger values chiefly homogeneous regions and detail. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpenalties are detrimental. please note that the details of detail always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction Condency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in a direction. if you have a film baskets or CCD-noise will produce a high value wavy similar patterns. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated in a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value fits perfectly to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is being smoother, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be taller than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specify how often the algorithm is going through. typically, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Winkelstep-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotrophic alpha. if Alpha are chosen, it should also be small-selected. so take care that small angles should create a long term of life. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral interacting (0,1, 10]: integral step-wide in pixels. you should bet the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low. he doubles its duration. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons store as well as loading accurately this. each setting of images can be fixed in a text file and be loaded later again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Imaging errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can look like pictures with small artifacts corrected. the module will be applied in a photo that in Guatemala City with a analogous camera has been applied. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The checking came; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to lessen image quality. it uses a protected algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable images, to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, remove. it can also be used to remove sensor-noise from the camera or modem; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on Sensorrauds from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shown above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensation. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully used with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings may remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can blurred the image. the area mentioned through the radius is moving over the image and the color in it becomes smoothes and thus purged minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focal point. this value sets the pixelabt. if it increases, smoking is deleted. you may need to change the edges of the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter images cannot get more and smoked or lubricate once again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the movie. if it can be too strong can not be removed the entire smoking or smoking. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a wither smoking or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminance of the image. we recommend you either color or illuminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or illuminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which typically are more construed to increase. however, he also merge the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjitteriness. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted when it is too high can occur. if it is too high, noise and phasenjitter may occur at the edges. he can remove sound tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used precisely for it. all parameters for noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and later loading.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected. the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes, a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to gauge the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to gauge. use tools for softening with the menu entry, visualize and experiment with the smooth. the display window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The ship came; Photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographs.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's sound, scratches, compressive, compressive and local errors that occurs in digital, original or subsequently digital images, which makes the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the algorithm is performed with a different tool, the image infuser, executed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the image team of the REC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannist and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a loss of compressive Compressionists, he generates some compression & quot; artitequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this attitude should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as well as loading accurately this. each setting of photo Restoration can be saved into a text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with equine smokers. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous filmmakers on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and this corrected. can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures can be reduced to an old colour photo, which was used with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by scannerlighting and photopapier. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The menu came; tool hotpixel allows Hotpixel of photos that have to remove with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickft.</seg>
<seg id="554">Light, tote or hot pixel are particularly suitable for high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression through a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and" "" "quot; bright pixelquot;" "". "there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistant with the button Clear. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot water or light pixel through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark image to correcting the picture. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the assistant will notice the last dark-picture and automatically recharge this automatically during the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select one area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the movie. select then the best filter method to interpolate this pixelblocks. this is the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is determined an average of the neighbour pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels on the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance from 1 pixel block to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard method of the standard method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block to calculate a bi square square (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that will then be used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be reached to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a screenshot, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing. the original image was enlarged at 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The time checking, VignettierungsSurgery is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. subbelated corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Foresight lenses, especially those in the middle and large photographic format, can frequently illuminate the whole sensory area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light the sensor there. Telelenses show conditions also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">It also has drawbacks. many center filter do need a factor 1.5 or 2 with Blendenfilter that it's impossible to keep the camera with hand. foresight lenses should also use with Center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise the sharpness effects arise by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure of today's film and colour scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalents transformation on a blanket that is applied without this filter. the Vignettierungslasty tool uses the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three revisions, you can control the VignettierungsSurgery filter and with three additional remuneration of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of alternatal absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with a blatdensetting of 1, or randomly one light intensity of 2, delusion and reduce the density to a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous strength, contrast and gamma-settings: editing an image with the vignetting corrections reduces the luminosity of the pixels with these options. you only have to provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fineness of the exposure of the goal of the goal, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu selection; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettiation correction is applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminous and contrast-correction is also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The ship came; Linkedistorted is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. colorless distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grader treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or reversal form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar locking-effect, flax but at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth gradient is corrected the remote corners opposed to the second grader. if you combine these two each geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grades. with negative values, tonal failure can be corrected and positive values are tanned.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the engraver. this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameter returns the reverse mark of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus results in a correction first degree. negative values enlarge while positive the size diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten up: this value jusher brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion system is illustrated. the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnor and hoverical correction should be performed in front of all intersecting or size changes. the best run this correction is to be all first through. if you perform a picture new and then do a tonsiform correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it into an important place, such as the seater or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can fix the tonic / pad with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a hoverical distortion, the resulting image black nooks will have. you can remove them by cutting-cutting tools in the menu of transformations from the image processing or the zoom regulator of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tone-shaped correction is made. the next logical step for some motifs like e.g. photographs from the front, frame and painting, it's the perspective so correct that all angles in the image are 90 degrees. keep in mind that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have an easy distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonous correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of gimpstrap, which is accessible under this URL. filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can preview the area for viewing. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can simulate two parameters set filming and filmmakers (ISO). enable the option to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller may change the amount of cinematic and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter color channels for the reproduce of infrared film mixed, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs, as the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared cinematic effect applied to a landscaping from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture under (2). the sensitivity of the movie has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a sort of aura in the hairpin.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; Filter filmmakers is a simple to use tool to reproduce film granularity on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the producers of large silver baskets of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The cinematic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, granular sight specially in your monochromen photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to the control of the intensity and granularity of the bodies. the standard value is, although frequent higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more kernels, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the cinematic effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the modified version (2). the original movie-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The ship came; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The song came; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature paintings and stills are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulator to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush-size between one and five out. thicker brush controls better for large images. smooth controls controlled the smoothness or, from the other side looked like, the singularity.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and this has been marked with the (2) height. brush-size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and MDF 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The recording came; filter coal-drawing uses color-and intensive gradient to create a carbon calculation. therefore, pictures of their gradient is slowly change and therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline, that would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper equator selects the pin size and the bottom endowed the contrast (smoothtte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal-drawn filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be further improved by adapting the intention value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The checking came; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was blacked in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The checking came; Filter engraving is a fast tool to revert your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity, to transform the image into a gray, intense landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distorting effects. it uses protected algorithms of pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the image in cells and lets it look as if it is seen by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wavelength, the image is distorted here with a different version of stains.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of dirt effects. it uses protected algorithms of pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurredness: caught the image along star-shaped lines that are going by a center. this simulates the blurredness a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial ignorance: caught the image by rotating the pixel around a center. this simulates the blurredness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: blurring the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens. the object seems to come back to the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement sharpened: caught the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurredness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft plaque blurredness: caught the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright notes. this is made photos with a dreamy and shiny staking effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image through random shift in the pixels and simulates the blurredness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent insharpness: finds the paint-swallow in the picture and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel calculation using the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice small tool to make Regentropes on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drop. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish stocks changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can go with the checking; image processing an area free from rain drops. use the tool to select the area, for example a face, which is to stay free. if you start to start the filter bracket, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the filtered Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) points a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu of transformations and transformations.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a picture with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">To reduce a picture is simple. the big question is, how can you hold up an image and keep the details sharp? how can you reinvent the missing information or guessing the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here is a good job. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select shifting size in the menu and enter the destination values. the dialog is visible down.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size does use a linear intervention method to push the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation for enlarge an image. & digitization; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo shooting was developed by the image team of the REC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintained by the aspect ratio, when this setting is activated, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio is the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is being smoother, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be taller than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons are stored as and shop are used accurately. any recovery for photo can be saved as a text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move. you can cancel calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of photo bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the original image (2) is the result of linear standard enhancement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photos is not only a frequently run-run surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. the image editing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and retract of the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photo will cut off the path. this gives you a good overview how your photo will look after cutting area. you can drag the size of the angle to cut down. you can create a new rectangle by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button "button" button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file to store or save the file in the menu, to save the newly cut picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool-ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in high-format it is always assigned to the greater value of height and in the crossover format.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool-ratio to cut a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to automatically calculate the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialogue, you can place with the Max. ratio button to cutting the area to the maximum possible extent, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool-ratio, cut its settings depending on the orientation tool (horizontal directional or vertical). if you use the intersecting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on your orientation. the modified dimensions are reflected in the EXIF-tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected the customized image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the merger control allow assistance to blending, so that you can put your pictures better together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic parts are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elregel, harmonic triangles are able to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the Golden center is a dividing down on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the blood-blades of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have already been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who thus use your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times if you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number is equal to the sum of their two numbers. the standing divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that this rule is followed as visually harmoniously.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides fluid aid lines if you put a picture together. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-party hedgehogs generates a liquid line of the eye can follow through the picture. this type of composition leads the spectator along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the leggy of the golden spiral, also called Golden Laecke. these spelling are used to attach the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects. this can be simply being there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also head up from the top of the golden spiral. watch their vertex points are the midpoints of the pages of the golden area. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be dynamically released.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break up your frame create an effect of being called by professional photographs dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal directional and flip labels can be used to reflect the harmonic parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates an image where things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the checking; image processing and the tool free rotation. select transference Free Rotation and adjust the destination angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button default you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the turn is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines. after you move it through an important point of the picture, you can fix it using a pressure on the left mouse button. now jut the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you turned out a picture you will find unwanted three-angular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is to use the function transformative decut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatic mapping. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-Aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. please note the warning above.</seg>
<seg id="668">All the speculative transformations are conducted by a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialogue, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that have been created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the right corner: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little lubricated. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasantly triangular holes in the corners. one way to bersome is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool utility is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal resolution e.g. will distort the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotating, the image becomes distorted. in other words, a rectangle becomes into a parallelogram. you can start this module through transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Decorate your image by using the horizontal corner and the vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press on preference, the angle is displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="680">Your help becomes a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool utility to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shearing, the picture will be a bit blurred. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two gradations are producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After switching the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">Checking came; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiles were. in most distributions you'll be able to edit a large number of image formats with & checking;</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to provide a list of all available file formats on this site. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the extension came in the list, only files in formats are specified. if the extension is listed in the list, then the file extension comes from. you can edit this list of file extenders that have been checking and change. in the section configuration you can find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the used format. a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & publication; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images. thereby, redundant information reduces to save in this way the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results as JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also save losses if this is stated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the Rohner format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very useful instructions in English. you can convert raw images in JPEG or TIFF with the Rohonverter of & digitization. in the section configuration you can find further information on how to use modules with & B.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & graphic-viewer: project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; programme.</seg>
<seg id="727">& Pattern; is a KDE program for the viewing of & Graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & graph.graphic; displays graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & successful; -program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (such that a change in the graphene in & Kate; the graphs are recomputed and displayed in & graphed;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & Kate; to open or to open the graphs in & Cougraphed; in one & Kate; -component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading of large graphs (currently there are problems of about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphic; -tool & dot; for the representation of the graphene is required.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphics, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & graphing; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case the toolbar contains only the icon file opened and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more dot; files select the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview will be displayed in the corner when the Graph is bigger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the contextual menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the unicycle (high and down without special prices, left and right at pressing & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has been changed in & graphically; loaded file has been changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the Graph is to be recharged or if you want to ignore changes, so that later it will happen. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraphviewer; see... see also.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools available to localise images geographically in spherical co-operation system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitudinal are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx Format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can summarize a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. in order to run a possible correlation over time and localisation, you have to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data the same time in the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded a automatic corroborated, which displays the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera system has to be refunded with the GMT. this can be done with the timezone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives a high deviation for the GPS time and cameration. lies the deviation under which the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference between 2000 seconds then will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolls and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the appropriate data. if you know that in reality a locating is located in a large period difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlated to the interpolating.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates are manually set with this dialog manually. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. since dialogue is marked by calling one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and displayed with the shown map and enlarge. select the relevant region and enlarge it. the height must always be selected manually. the map can always be selected from card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodifier module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide. everything in one go and in just a few easy steps.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodians can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module makes use of the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can add a basic screen. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can choose a background-color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. after that, you can create over extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then enumerated in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to select the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds the picture is displayed. a low value will be specified below. a low value creates a very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background-color can be set next. in doubt you should put it in black. the name and the path of the created file can be set in the name of the MPEG output file. keep it as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file using the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. depending on the speed of your machine, you can start drinking coffee or in all calm a coffee and enjoy the Slideshow. if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that Kodians or tools is missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The pressurised assistant allows multiple images to print on a sheet paper together in standard photosets. the combined images can also automatically be opened with image processing Gimp. this is e.g. usefully to improve you or with the Gimp module to print directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your data stored in one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM. everything in one go and in just a few easy steps.</seg>
<seg id="854">Conversion is based on the commands tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original type of Him is: expect from dcraw not to create the same results as the software from your camouters. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file converted and start the module. the Raw-image converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button, you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera preferences are to be used for the white-off. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be jacked. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are sneak with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss of explosion-free LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to use your pictures frequently or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that are contained in the RAW file are stored in the EXIF data in the JPEG file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use aborting.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch-processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time. use this mode for example, if you are sure, for example by testing on a single picture which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file. this is helpful if it's made in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can put the prefix, the startup and the timestamp of the record.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it makes use of the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image below:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed by this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: prepare the image for photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images before. further pictures can drag on the list of pictures and discard it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures are displayed window frames displayed by you. you can add additional pictures to the button in the button. for the last selected picture, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and put them there in order to add them to the list of imagery.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, the selected pictures from the list of the images are removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window will open your e-mail clients. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected have already attached.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of the emails emails. it may be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path in the input field, including the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your machine beforehand. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments on the pictures are merged into a text file and sered the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu photos file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among lossfree formats such as TIFF. therefore you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photographic quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend to you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images and are the original text files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata are added to the imagery.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status of the status of the status. however, your e-mail program is automatically started at the end. with the button Schclosing you can lie in this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau, a window with questions like you would like to have shown your Slideshow. you can choose between the pictures selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The config-transitions in the presentation use very elegant image outputs by using OpenGL. however, you need to possess a corresponding graph card since otherwise the Slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option to display filenames ensures that the datastame of images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually abort it using Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images accidentally select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it will not be the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Lag between images can be set between images below. 1500 milliseconds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you should therefore check this before you present your friends presentation!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, if any change between images choose another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date jusc has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. respect: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module currently sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a backdrop for your KDE's surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have equipped your pictures and videos, you can use & photo album; through this browser, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, thus in people, places and in the group sections.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window check the categories for which you typed information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look after EXIF based information, look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumbnails will be described.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the browser's view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">When you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can preview images to look at the images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol before her name. you can save with & photo album; however, for each person to save your own look, this is of course also true for places, keywords, and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images in addition to the name, select the button, which you want to use right outside on the toolbar. this has the advantage that you can choose for example symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, define what image should be displayed for each individual. in order to view this, you'll have to display the picture-in picture window, as shown in the picture. here you can select the picture for the respective person. in the guide window, you can adjust the delimation factor according to your needs and thus select which part of the picture is to be displayed and / or duplicated.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call the entry to search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialogue for fixing the picture features. this dialog can be seen on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the captions and descriptions of images are searched for this text. if you like, you can also type a date to search for, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, by pictures, on which Jesper is not illustrated by Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the manual for & photo album; if you do not like to read handbooks, but rather want to try handbooks, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & photo album; and check out the quick-entry, the Screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and select in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select in the menu Help menu entry. a demo can launch some sample pictures and you can try the features of & photo album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & photo album; as an integrated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photo album; see the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different periods. each list then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the leg only 10-minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used in the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries view from the database (if you choose a date, the first image is displayed in the preview video) and furthermore the timeline is always shown on the current date of the current picture when you navigate in the preview picture.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a area of the time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the Lineal of the time-line, so the timings, drag. if you choose one area, you will be shown in the preview picture only images of this timeframe. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the time.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photo album; introduces you two options available to create HTML pages with your images. the one is available in & photo album; in the following part of the user manual, the file format is described in & photographies; integrated version described you can create about the HTML File menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before using HTML pages, you must make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the titles of the passage and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphoto album; HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & photo album; export file should be created to see on the review page. nutrient information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which can also be displayed without a description. for example, that all pictures are exported at party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are clear, so this is not made specific to this.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. therefore, those who look at your website and possess a monitor that will have the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. therefore, it can search your pictures with lower resolution, which leads to a lower transmission period. if he wants to get an image larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select all your HTML files is a root folder and a new subfolder for every subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location next time. you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if this really is all visible to the viewer. if you choose the root folder a URL, after the pages have been created, then this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files still haven't been in the final target folder, you need to copy it manually. so that the import function, see, properly functioning, you must specify the final target of the files, but the root folder in which all subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just setup options have been related to all three basic folders or URLs. in this case, a subfolder will be created, whose name you set in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; you might want to create a HTML-page for viewing the images. if you already have a lot of time, the image information, persons on the pictures, reception, etc. step, then you have to do with & photo album; this work will not even go.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the decoders are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ whether the images are stored in the file or if it's just a link to images in the file. the advantage all images are to be saved to the file and that you can pass that file independently. the obvious drawback is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file either directly from the File File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two ways. first, the pictures are found in the folder of the .kim file. the corresponding pictures are not found, so the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files, this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file by using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following the dialog for the export of images is described, which you can call via the File File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .kim files, the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">By selecting manuel near the .kim file, you need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the vicinity of the .kim file copy, copy, the pictures are automatically created for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed to JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not profitable to compress the files. if you want this, just select the option export file compress.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limited maximum size. if you send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by using, for example, that every image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file using the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file, select & photo album; the exported database as described in detail.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import imports consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are personable to personalize the category people from the to imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called by your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories to import to the imported file and which categories they fit in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can identify the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you view images, you often want to see images of your Italy-package and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass through the different steps (1) fixed the information about your pictures, about (2) the throughgoing and prestige, to (3) advanced topics and adaptation possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program for stealing your pictures. but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual will be talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; saves all its information in the index.xml file at the top folder of their choice. this is a simple XML file, which you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS where they like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used at future starts automatically. if you like another folder tree with pictures, you can start & photo album; with the option -c. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphoto album; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & photo album; in the following section of the user guide you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can access settings, preview and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">You can also describe how you can set up different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals, or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On display the dialog, which is used to already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories are already mentioned. in dialogue options you can set the complete members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group, rather than explained all groups of a medium as explained in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view, you will find the setup options available to you. with the above selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, you will find a list of the current category and list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; divide the module system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin Interface. nutritional information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can be called and are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help-page that you can access through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules used by several applications can be used together with each other, it may be that the modules are tested using the demo database before using them on your own pictures applicable & photo album; demo database, you can either call using the command line using the command &gt; photo- demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the menu Help. don't tell, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules about KIPI together are very different, which allows it to be that some modules with & photo album; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are using their images in albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order for albums, so that you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here we simulate & photo album; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the latest album, & photo album; the modules also pass a list of albums. here goes & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you've specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you are using the category people, you will do & photo album; so if you would have selected individuals to view this and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Because some modules are compatible with & photo album; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start to install dialog and select in the area module, which modules are supposed to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starter screen when you start & photo album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, see the menu above a menu and a toolbar. at the moment you can't find much information about your pictures. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & Got album; is the possibility to see each image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, etc. you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for instance on all images Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen have been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes may be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see this notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting up people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photo album; as you can use it again and again if you type information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to push the images within the list: if for example you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 persons, you can find that the used names are moved upwards to find and locate people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting on date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected pictures and put these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons, which are under the preview of the picture right upstairs.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all situated in the US. moreover, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a group of group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the package catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new section or subcategory. in addition, you can also put an entry in a category and put there in order to sort this one subcategory of this item. attention, this presupposes that you are having just your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the different elements of the package. by forming the list, the top-edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by entering it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window in such a way that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button below..., which features you the possibility to save up the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button below... and then window will fade. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you choose the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or any images in case you don't have a filter. you can check the size of thumbnails, by simply changing the mouse with the middle mouse button. try to configure it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you get a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is furnished as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture-picture. if you don't have a window opened with a picture-picture, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture show. simply select the right images you would like to delete and select either the Delete button or select the Edit menu. now, the window will appear that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & photo album; namely, pictures can also use, without you saved on the hard drive. of course, you must have saved the pictures somewhere, so that & photo album; you can see the pictures anywhere else in the database. in the picture you can view the view from & photo album; if not all the required images can be loaded from your hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, in which the right upper hand is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails will be displayed, so that & photo album; you can view the preview of these pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the picture viewing.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires that you can copy files back and copy files back into the folder. so, you don't support you to ask the filing of the respective CD. if you want to avoid any trouble, such as the mess of your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk in order to be able to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you want to block the images in the end of the menu. alternatively, you can also block all the images that your little sister can see, contoured, and block the menu-on all besides current views.</seg>
<seg id="990">To make you set out what images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you just choose the laptop with your little sister, just choose the menu entry images you have locked. if you want to get the images again, click on Sperre uplift.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered into the image of the images. to set up this password, simply select your password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means absolutely sure. at the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other hand anyone can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection serves only for those who are familiar with & photo album; not very familiar to repel the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you are looking for all of your pictures with & photo album; manage and / hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & photo album; via an image _ and Videoviewing. you can preview how described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in view. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can draw it with the mouse and drop them elsewhere. you can also configure the information displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right-click menu. you can see the shortlisted menu button below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see the appropriate entries on this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a slide. & photo album; then loads a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can load a new picture by pressing the Strg button and Plus as well as minus. and stopped and stopped by buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful capability of the spectator of & photo album; is it in full-screen mode to change. in this mode, the viewer is using a complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to fullscreen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can get into the image and get out into the image. with the minus button you can get back rout the Plus button in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your oom, so that the image is not drawn zoomed. with the same key it uses the zooms, so that every pixel is equivalent to the screen to a pixel of the image.</seg>

<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item note from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the viewing dialog dialog's image to submit this name. you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you see one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above the viewer gives you the opportunity to provide pictures with features, while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter. in a picture, you can see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have features your pictures, these are available in your browser. so, if you have any pictures that you edit, print or whatever selected, so you can easily use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or what ever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the view view. if you can view categories in Dre preview, then you can add characteristics to the images by pressing the letter for the characteristic after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image. in this case allows you & photo album; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see an image on the bottom of the painting. to switch the painting mode from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply hit the cross in the toolbar on top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & povmodeler, you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not entirely control, but the documentation about & Povray; should you have read and understood absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can choose single objects. then their properties are shown in the properties tab and the object displays yellow-yellow views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects simultaneously. but not the object of a selected object, since all subcommands are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object to the object tree, choose the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following listing menu is listing, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar below Edit or from the right-click menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered attributes, click Applicable to apply these changes. if you typed invalid values, a message will be shown with a error description. then you can correct the input errors and re-adjust the changes with abortions.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the dialog dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the illustrated object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in your own view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in your own view and a small example of the scene is minimized with the selected texture, even if you want to have selected a subordinated item (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cruising locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and it will appear a small cross in the Drawing model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the location for shifts. you can change the shift through dragging with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Every object as a wire model has a Visibility level. you can specify this value relative to the visibility of the superior object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their Visibility level of small or equal the Visibility level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window assignment as default. the object-tree and the view of the lens properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default content order, or if you need any other arrangement, you can adjust it to any number. you can also save multiple window frames and simply switch between different assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or below one available view, pull the starter at the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, pull the starter on the right hand or left side of a view. the new view is anchored to the right hand or left side of the view and extends beyond the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over the other, drag the starter in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views via clicking on the mapping fixtures on top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the starter on the desktop or click the small to the left above shown arrow in the faszination bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the mainboard. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert extra views into the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are hovering, you can anchor them on any spot.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window frames... save it. it will display a dialog where you can store the window-order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can renders it. & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5-currently. this version is stored in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click on the icon renders The icon renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A rocking mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of pensions modes, from a fast preview to full-pictures in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Render modes... choose the following dialog open:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, useful is a name that lets the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map card size you can insert the width and height of the framed picture. if you only want to train a small area of the picture, select the crossover section and enter the section section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; for renders use. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflexive illumination. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user's manual and Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is transported by only a ray of pixels, different errors can be created. these pictures often have a moan air pattern or marsh effects in curves and lines, plus sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature better look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn off anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a ray on pixels. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of Super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adaptive; recursively, because every pixel is constantly divided into and adaptive because the recursion projection depends on the calculated colour.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray depending on pixels. if you set the difference between colorations to the neighboring pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth level on 4, a grid of 4x4 will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays according to pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixel will be calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays according to pixels. if the difference between the color values exceeds the above-given threshold, the pixels will be followed individually and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the production of smokers for the ray process, called jittering. if you turn out Jittering, modified & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderment is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which diffuse diffuse of light reflection. it takes a very long time to let a scene calculate with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can set whether the Alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel will be transparent if the associated beams does not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window to display the & Povray; if & Povray; if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -scene to import, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently support & kpovmodeler; not the complete command-reach of & Povray; if in case of import error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all the messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support code text in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the code text for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object to the created text file in the editor, just highlight the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert code for & Povray; also to insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene removes. usually, this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">Click on the Help in Featura view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. imagine the path to your document and the version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example hriddling) into the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you are incorporating files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to those files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the windows type characteristic.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the Raster in the context menu of the Drawing model Views. you can set the Raster separately for shifts, scalizations and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Bigger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail time for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross High Status Credits for extended projections, all the wire model is further divided, when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time to start rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you show a wall, a wall is rounded behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you display floor, a floor is rounded below the objects. the soil is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross the edge of edge, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for renders of the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise information on the parameters can be found in the section of Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window frames or create new window frames. in the section window, it explains how to create and store window frames.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinational element Standard-window Appendix: displays all existing window frames. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window assignment at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing windows of windows shows all available window frames. a new arrangement can delete you with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window-assignment is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below names reveals all views of the chosen shell order. new views can delete you with the button and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with which you anchor a mapping view in common with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just got & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and now you would like to start out without precise knowledge of the two programs. if you want to follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate yet simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that, as a result you can only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't fit light sources, your whole scene is in the dark, and you will receive only one black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all the error-free installed, you can see at the first Start of & kpovmodeler: the following previewed windows order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so you can get a proper idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols must now be used frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you create. in particular, you notice it in the fourth dragon model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderment of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now includes a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the view Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved, but note that the camera can change in View Points, with which you can change the camera item on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or input key, the wire model element and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could for example insert a quader for example (inserting Enges body Quader) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& Kpovmodeler; offers really a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plain in the object tree, change the name and then push the button application or input key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the level even if at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can select the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should postpone the floor to practice a unit under the horizon line, just so you get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select at the moment something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog, in which you can select how to paste the object. you can change the name in the object tree. you can see the name in the property view (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment displays only a matured black material because you can check settings for the pigment. therefore, you can always check the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but you are now the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see color on quader and ball, click on the button 'button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is set right now. if you are reading your picture with a click on the symbol, you should receive the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, that is not the color you have expected. in the color list, you need to enter two new attributes, called monochrome. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard Color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree jedesmal and change the colors in the view of the properties tab:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be easily executed, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; they have already understood the ball as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties tab you can immediately change the settings. place the value for the radius: at 1 (do not forget the input button or the button application), so the ball has hovering over the ground as you have moved the ground to a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Off course, the rendering is now a strange result: as you can see earlier, the ball-surface appears as a matured black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can assign a material now. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in the ball-pigment. click on the ball-pigment, select then monochrome and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or push the input bar.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The configuration shine-effect and Reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraylov is a pensions method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you tracer a scene raytracings, the renderer consists of the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera, which prevents the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the rocking is calculated on how to impact the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog could affect. so the scene pixels being edited for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see a camera nothing, the camera is your eye, with which you look the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene, which is to be curated, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created using & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Always, when you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu, replacing the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already stored the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to pre-stain surfaces, without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes you can use as components: very complex 3D models are produced by dozens, or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then be processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may create existing multimedia keys so that they work as & Amarok; this will make your keyboard on the & Amarok; control centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly seen in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions from collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP's break could be a break:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the lines of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some own command options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed on account of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use dialog, so that the user doesn't run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">BEGIN require 'Rescue LoadError error =' Korundum (KDE bindings for Ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. 'Postdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In folder scripts / templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or just extend it to the necessary functions. you will quickly realize that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP can exchange your scripts with AmaroK and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which every KDE installation should be attached.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow the embiting of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; relatively easy can be called. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, strings to monitor their standard input will be monitored constantly and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the dialog dialog. to save the store and loading of the furnishings, each script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the job folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signaled that a new piece is alluded. the script could now play & numb; with DCOP functions, you can ask further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the lenght-length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signaled a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu Opening PATHs contains the path to select the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be used. to remove an entry, one can remove the DCOP-function dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemized).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok, it is finished, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar) that can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive names such as Amaroscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should designate your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script should be executable (+ x), the remaining written modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok. for your entry on kde apps, you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can easily drag music to the playlist instead of going through endless menus. perhaps you are looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collecting's browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many general USB devices. furthermore, lots of different audio systems can be used, so EVER can be able to hear your music. this and yet many more useful features make Amarok to the most advanced audio player. Amarook is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right to reexperience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, one must enter the basic folder of Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok and install:</seg>

<seg id="1206">& Amarok; as most applications, it has some options to enable or disable a compiling point with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you activate this setting, Amarok; relative paths to the music files, based on the playlist of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">You can see the updates visible in piece changes, that the playlists window opened - / rolrolls to keep the current piece always in the visible window range.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context-browser automatically switching the context-browser to change once the next piece is alluded.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the section image, you can adapt & Amarok; the layout is customisable. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the paper section, you can use the use of different writings in & Amarok. by flagging of own scripts, the otherwise gray image is activated. you can select writings for the following area: playlists windows, player windows and context browser. press to select... so you can choose a preferred font in the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">The sub-screen on-screen display allows you to disable the OSD. if on-screen display is displayed, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click on select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the cross-field shadow causes the text in OSD shaded.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Own colors use gives you the opportunity to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog to suit choice. if desired colours do not use enabled, the presented & cold colours will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display device displays the text shown in the OSD. by entering horizons, the OSD can be customized to meet your needs. below you will find a list of the available placeholder and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen screen is meant for Xinerama users. this allows you to define on which screen a multi-speed monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The mapping card audio-output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-box. some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this mapping.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The mapping collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection. that includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; to search a folder in the collection, select the crossing field next to his name. this section also contains seizapping fields to setup, as should be performed with the selected ordinators.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Subfolder recursively search: this causes that & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Make changes: allow & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). additionally, a incremental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Playlists: causes that & Amarok; all found playlists are added to your collection (.pland.m3u files) to your collection. the playlists will then appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part of the payment database is used to select a database for the collection. the CombinationsField driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further establishment is necessary in the MySql establishment.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The section MySql-device is used for setting up the database for & Amarok. under computer, the machine is typed on which the MySql database is entered. subsequently, under port, the network port is entered, under which the database is achievable. name: is the database name, to which the connection is established.</seg>

<seg id="1241">Similar interpreters call: after activating this attitude will call & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters on the same play. note: you can view the list in the context-browser. note: you do not need a load-load profile to be able to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio-player for Unix systems (like & b; Linux). further information can be found in the summary of the features and gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package Kdelicate and otherwise no more KDE-packages. you need to have Khazbs therefore installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; require some of them in order for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, such as Kdelibs are minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presupposes that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. therefore, fluxbox will support some difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt because these are providing an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the taglib library for days. you can view the file by clicking into ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log and also attach the caputte file that has caused the crash. then you can delete the file and make the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the fact is that Taglib crashes into reading the Meta info from this file. please report this error to the conference Lib developers under bub.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then try SQLite. the support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, e.g. & Amarok, with GCC 3.3.x compiled, this leads to topple when editing the Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, you disable automatic. turn off if inactive for... in the adjustment of the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to the fact that many of the program data as UTF-8 can write to meta info, but they do not mark it as a Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0] exists not" unless - f [0]); my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "errors in writing the tags of $argv [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you receive this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setERK7Qpixmap, then check out if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliating Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most of the installation problems clarify most lightest through the help of an expert your Unix- or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or for developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenworthy .net on the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After starting off & Amarok; appears just a blank playlist. how do you get there music pieces?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That is easy. use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start-window has been converted into the statistics window. you can find it under extras.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The importance of these symbols has changed with Amaro1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the evaluation by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate the pieces, the playlist must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column for viewing. you can also use the short-command Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1467">Open the CD-copying dialog. this also allows you to create a CD from a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only want to create an image from a CD, which you can then eventually burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD-copying dialog. alternatively, without project file the copying of a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only burn one image of a DVD, which will then be able to burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of the copying dialogue is not yet supported, hence the target medium must be big enough to record the whole (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to form a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & K3b; allows you to write the choice between the typhoi and incrementally.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previous CD-image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file burned down as a data source, which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously released DVD-Video can be converted. thereby, this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be used single-standing video, code settings, and even ways to change the size and to cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the occasional medium. this information is represented in the table view and include properties of the medium, such as size and title length of CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of the toolbar of & K3b; if an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small list is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switch off the folder view, or off. the folder view includes an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the thumbnail is enabled, their content is displayed in the corner view. CD / DVD drives also have a shortcut menu with functions such as media info, locks, and locks of the running or throw of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Unlock the table view, or off. the view view allows selecting and pulling files into the projector. the view view is also the interface to read audio- or video CDs, if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Switches the piste into the project view, or out. the copying list is a narrower section that contains only visible when the projector has open projects. the copying list has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the projector clear from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This will open a dialog window to change keyboards for & K3b; after one has selected one of the available commands in the upper part, one can adjust the scanning area to it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; Configuration Assistant. this allows the correct entitlements for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system manager rights need to enter, therefore, you must enter the password for the system manager (root) when starting the assistant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; in this case, general programs may be made. nearly all functions of & K3b; should be in touch. this dialog is meant to personalize and for the distressing of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & D; applications also, with a & DCOP; -Interface is equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled using a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the functionalities, therefore it's more of your taste and the type of your task is crucial to what the accompanying program you give you.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; to use the functions, you have to make sure that & K3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions which have all the & kde; in common, support & K3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface of & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, format DVD, and other functions to provide new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPreateate.DVDProject () DCOPrefrateMovixDVDProject () DCOPrefrateMovixDVDProject () DCOPrefrateMovixDVDProject () DCOPrease Cdrw () ECOPrease Cdrw () void-format Dvd () void, DvdImage (Kururl) void burnDvdImage (Kururl)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXX method one receives a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: D3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project will be obtained via # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b --audiocd.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface as well as the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void addurl (Qstring name, Qstring Parent) void removeItem (Qstring path) void removeItem (Qstring path, Qstring newName) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT BrowateFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT Cream / home / truwin / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& Kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; - Creators for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the Encoder of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& Kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD files on the hard drive) and by many coders that these WAV files are coded (compressed). further encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD are being read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as loss of FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & Kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggums is already installed (for .GG) or other codiles. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions available, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which stove / file format is to be used? the Chapter catcher Kodians is a small introduction of encoders, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & audiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD. if not the firmware version of the & CD; / DVD tools can handle the protection, it is not possible to bypass a protected audio CD. simply avoid buying the copying audio CD; simply avoid the purchase of Copy Audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup has to be made only once (the dialog dialog) can be called so often up to a suitable configuration), afterwards the daily handling of a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to an understanding of the slim character of the user interface, which you will frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from the freeDB will get from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a brief list of commands from the main window. on the page step by step example there are more information how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the establishment of your request in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts the read and - if a Encoder was configured in the code settings tab in the ordering party - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available Encoder to allow the selection to be read with another Encoder as the default. it is noted that previously the Encoder is configured in the dialog box in the dialog dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that an already downloaded file will be selected rather than a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog dialog to determine the type of notifications (such as protocols, Piepsen) for programming events (such as interpreting the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main use dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different mapping maps (like Encoder, to setup the Encoders). here you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes tape quality, coders, and compression rate and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to go lost is a loss-free audio format required. besides FLAC it is also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the downsides are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial equipment that can reproduce the files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats, the information obtained through data composing depending on their psychoacoustical model are MP3 and OGG. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences will be less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless delivered with most distributions available free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based computer system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG covers are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - initially - these devices are often only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset Medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer outstanding transparency for most people and most of the pieces of music, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of juveniles, portable devices and car stereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which is manually entered or generated by the software automatically from the freeDB Explorer, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed over / used using & kaudiocreator; and the codification program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of programs for the Kodians and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & colapocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing of the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which individuals can download the audio CD, so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it's to note that here only the text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes it should be legal, but I (if the author concerned) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more information available on the & CD; more or less worthless so neither the artist nor the music can be damaged. all information may be obtained with a bumblebee by one & CD; business, physically or virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & Couaudiocreator; is actively a cross-box use (Send an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address when retrieving the data from the server (This may be only the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freeDB, the geographical store will be used for the next mirror servers. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online range of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which outlet is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that this cdparanoia is used; anyone who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to be aware that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the exuberated WAV files the coders and therefore the desired file format can be chosen. during the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of code for audio data) on the tab to setup the code. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codifier package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution, before the coding can be used. this is also required for predefined coders. for more information about Kodians are located in Chapter Jucher Kodians.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a stove, further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a counter window (eg. console). in doing so, 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the spelling and reading files of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might give an indication of what's wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete handbook, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame may be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have screamed it on it (eg you try to copy it into the transqueror bit).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what must be repeated for any taping & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used co-coding for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the file format. since we are lazy we share the program using the freeDB to use the & CD to download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can always change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change it with each reading a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation will be handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; files / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, the effective tool designation may be specified too. if on the drive with other programs can be accessed, a look into the file / etc / flint and an attempt with the existing entries of equipment for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The mapping of universal settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything will be shown as entered / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only When unavailable information can be asked, so that you will be informed if information about the detection of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The mapping card CD; just select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD data automatically via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately by reading the & CD; which is later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting filesname / filename or tag entries, they can be easily changed using Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & D; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, further notice: if you want to enter everything manually, you disable the selection units and freeDB is not used. however, this is more than 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worth it. to be chosen freeDB in the offline mode, the two selection fields have to be selected at least the first. the mode is set up in the following mapping.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data-inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server on the Internet. how does the system know which data is to be given the CD? read the section on freeDB. put all the way it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to site freedb.org and look back for a mirror server nearby. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, since however many firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit any & CD; data to the freeDB server should be delivered. the first notion of application should be devised.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously exiting pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one simultaneously with just an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know it, therefore just try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; throw out the last piece: cruising this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folders for temporary files: when you cross this folder, then / must be stored the path / folder in which the WAV files is present. if the field is not been crossed, the files are created in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to enter as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned previously, this is an adjustment for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and energy consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the tags at version V1 / V1.1st 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' meeting point for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Just put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to codify WAV files: for a Dualcore or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to run more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic establishment of & Kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for each reading a & CD; used. if you chose the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described, like the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music on the hard drive has been described and up. first, a connection to the Internet is constructed, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data is described in this section must be repeated for every releasing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, watch the screen photos a little different from the data you have for one & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD. therefore you will learn the & CD manually instead of retrieve them from the Internet. comments will point out the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD has to be set, into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, like in the screen shot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as audio CD; it could be read and from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers depending on the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully completed by the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces are already filled out and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; gives, a window will be built-up, and you can select the database entry, according to your opinion the best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the starting box chosen for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings) have chosen, you can also manually trigger this by choice of the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - entering CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the dates for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'latest title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be typed in the input field 'Present', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for individual comments on each piece, the commentary box of the album will be used for comments which apply for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful cancellation of the data from the freeDB the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words start with uppercase letters or not...) but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and at only 28 characters for the commentary volume. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field lenght, at least on what & colaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the KodiererSetters tab; take a look at the section 'preferences' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can modify the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all the encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoding to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obvious with the style of the listing CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not submit the & CD. for further information please go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the data collected, which we have collected for the first piece. just enter the entries for the current piece. the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB database. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">This is the third button in the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked as well. just make sure that all the pieces are selected, or add the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If clicking on the button selection out the reading process was started, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to turn on the order window. it is in the upper left half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the upper left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>

<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you sum up. these are played in the series after. in this section stands, as you can efficiently use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then give the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the desired ones in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection you get all the songs that you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. concerns that when you add many pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>

<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not activated, opening one piece it is activated and emptied to the temporary collection. this collection will then be added to the opening items.</seg>

<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs will be played. if you select the sequence according to the submenu theme of the menu, the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>

<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter since it is stored in the departure of & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map general-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and can therefore sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you do not need MIDI map, because all Soundcard GM - compatible (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file, which saves all the necessary settings for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section must only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear so often as desired. however, for this reason, however, that each occurrence may be a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP" ""... "END Define KEYMAP" ""... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END" ""</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an E-Mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be compatible with devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section it is indicated, as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is thought that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line to one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all KeysTo M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M (GM Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a gun. to this end, wear the following in the PATCHP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If so, if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun sample) it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, with which every sound is a different peruse instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the sound does the sound height of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how notes are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the order of the lines is very important, just as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names on the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used most of all to make notes on the hairpin channel. look at the charts as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to switch some channels to another. if you want to forego the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these adjustments are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion to a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name Name for this canal. if you use keymap option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case then will always be used patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perk patch on the Persian canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio will be multiplied with the value pitch-Bender-Events with the value n, this is refunded with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only then passed. the value of 4096 is used to stand in the map file (not decimal scales).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM admits that a keyboard, which is a pitch-player with the value of 4096, will play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to try some notes to play two notes up to an octave. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; getting around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole string of clavials (one for every MIDI channel). on these claviatures you can see which sounds are played exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, it doesn't seem green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to indicate the played notes. the view select in the menu settings under the point of edge view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed at which a song is played and the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, Deb) by & kmid; if that happens, because & kmid; without Awe support compiled. to fix the issue you must download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before you activate definitely the setting of automatic added to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can adjust the arrow-button on the left from the template-screen to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & transqueror; windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or violently (when I play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, simply switch to the & Konqueror window and drag the file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the setting of an automatic tracking to the collection, and the new one; file is added to temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so imagine the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me that, further on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends mainly on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an Awe card.</seg>

<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and closing can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; the files will be ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / Exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during the start does not need to be short, it will be automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end of the animation however annoying, the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favourite photos: & lt; smiles; & / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" intel; & / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit; In source package of & kmPlayers; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmPlayers;</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mPlayers.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration panel of & kmplayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc, as is the setup of the backend by mimetype. here's an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash "can be played within & kmPlayer; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1726">Thus getting a pre-designed backend for a particular Mime type is taken (of course only if this was also found), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc. for example, phonon should reproduce all the ogg files:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this type of playux extension should be working for the X server. for this reason, the videoprolinux extension should be functional to the X server. therefore, the video file must contain in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1760">With automatic processing of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ '{command}) by & kile; automatically a space line (for the input of the text) and the added line to the end of the command (e.g.\\ using {command}). this function can be depleted in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most beautiful and subvert element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">For the view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In creating the own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex; files (narrowing) file, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the appropriate line in latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF the entire output of & tex; or latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and systems.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with others is integrated .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide Master-document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File formats: in this mode the DVI; file is detected, and there is no call from & ocular; after the quick-installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In case of edit toolbar, the three major selections are stripped in the document. the first selection field is for the quick structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection range has been included in the terms of articles such as tags, Fusions, notes or references. the range of options are:</seg>

<seg id="1772">Cover: is used for the reference to a specified term (selection on a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">By contacting a quotation, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. by & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & b;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & cold.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with its name is used for defining the font. it can be used for the main text, the joints, etc. there are the following fonts available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and stacking settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\, class included the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays the font. if the font does not set at the beginning, this may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was typed, the & latex; source code is compiled. the easiest way to do this is the usage of the building or the button's quickest.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code text must be stored before the compile. & kile; for the storage of it automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Noted the compile of the document, should be searched for the errors in the log. when using fast-installation, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text, which is different from the restful document. for example, a report with the font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ using {environment}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The options are only attended within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no signage (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options for locking the readability and user-friendliness of the document. it may include certain fonts, fat, courses, courses, underwear, etc. these commands may occur either with the command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the short course and is long as long as it is closed down with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a proposition can be explained with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ score: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with latex; marker language, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & b;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistants a bit of text was inspired, a few adjustments to the better readability of the document should be accomplished. you should be mindful quote, a few places in the fat and short course and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, using Editor's View or Strg E you can return to the editor (with an external viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript language. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a smaller file format (engl. D e V ice I nist). these files are created by & tex; or latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer are created. there are many different types of .dvi edition like printers, & PostScript; / PDF -Shift or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of an & DVI; file are the same steps as the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed correctly (if the printer is properly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file has been created from the latex; source code, the transformation can begin into various formats using the button in toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"" "the link" "" "Search" "" "gives the direct leap from the editor to bypass position inside the DVI; file." ""</seg>

<seg id="1796">If in the application of fast-installation of the & DVI; -Views, a bug can be present. if an error is available, this is displayed in the log file or in the Newswindow in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file is ringed the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can track down the error-like LaTeX errors and the correct LaTeX errors. in the editor, the log file appears to be clicked on the error in the log file, and stile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the template used for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting lequial document, a document can either be written from scratch or used to help the assistant to quickly create a new document. further information on this can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of latex; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be found in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file skillfully or a new file must be created. & kile; can create a new template using a document using an existing document and document templates.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file New, some character chains are replaced by other data (e.g. name or strings). these variables can be adjusted in settings Kile... settings must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering document class. typically, it will be used as such:\\ The class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the resulting commands built in the Editor. once the document has been created in this way the following steps has been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can select your own template instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any own latex; a simple way to create a template, should be searched for a template and be carried out under the steps described below.</seg>

<seg id="1973">For & quantapSaul; from version 3.3, the debugging has been completely newly developed. the support for the non-built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead of this, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented that allows various implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plug-in is available that adds support to the use of & gubed; inquantapSaul.</seg>

<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger, if necessary, manufactured, or it shares the plug-in with to listen to Debugan's needs. this action is opened by default, when a project is opened, which must normally not be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates the sounds to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server for a debit request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points the debugger, with the execution of the script to begin and information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executable line constantly. if this happens, the execution continues, before a Debugan request was started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger, to start with the execution of the script, without information on monitored variables and the current point number. if this happens when a script is stopped, the execution continues before a debit request was commissioned, the execution starts as soon as a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger introduces the next instruction to the script without responding into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next instruction in the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes faultless.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and deklaried whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible to allow other users to gain better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is set out in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains only one element type about itself otherwise nothing else.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor that achievable via DTD Bees DTD settings. thus, the descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created an easy & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantapplaud; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD statement.

<seg id="2028">The simplest promotions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or as input (or parts of the document). themselves are the Quick start-dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter should be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although skilled paths allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir Variable in command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file is file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process replaced. if by & quantapSaul; only one instance runs, the text is uniquely attached to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the datename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods there can be a script provided by & quantaplus; at the standard input. in the drop-box input can be determined what to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Select text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually recommended with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the introduced application can also be diverted. there are two kinds of output: normal output, to the standard output. it can be specified, which is to be specified with the text written on the standard output by placing the value of the selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in any case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you have to add and configure actions. select Settings settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the required fields and add them to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use their use, enable dialog "tag to deal" if available so that a input can be made when contacting the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, graphics and other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size of others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only assist you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start knob as a symbol. through the use of green (green, usually interpreted as less, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled, a message to the user, clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -tag will insert in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this will happen through the menu with attitudes actions... (in & quantapSaul;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so there are still what are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complete some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should make this a better overview by some Trenner in several groups. please open the toolbar to adjust the toolbar to make use of the toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose separator (very left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how Trento support grouping. anyone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by trying all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be imroot folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I first saw a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could notice in & quantapt. -repository whether someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. the first part is left to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configurations file [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, e.g. Section1.html Sec1.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html = Section1.html = Section1.html 2 = T1 html 2 = html 2 = tag2.html page 3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents = index.html = Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synonom.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it indicates that this is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the chess pros (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and in consequence at the top of the belly show & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but take care of & and & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all the XML-based & quantaplus; resources-based & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2066">The index stage is the area of the docrc file which is to be displayed for the user-sensitive help. by marking the function named and pressing by Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the text list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of the top-separated context elements which should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply while $HOME / .kde / share / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation have been used to the & quantaplus; -repository of the use through the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantonlus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the excreased resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else who will be sent to. at different places there will send an email menu entry such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, machine toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; the users are reviewed and only made available if our team need them as correct and useless for publication. to make an easy contribution we recommend to signing resources, where there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked about their Passphrase for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys you may need to pass a off. in dialogue New resource, the input fields have to be empty) and with clicking on OK the uploading will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can upload from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) to load toolbar, and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before installation, investigate & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signia. in the case of problems warns and it can then be broken. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a notification appears with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML-languages, which is currently not provided by & quantaplus; but the creation can be time-consuming, because hundreds of day files could be necessary in an open XML format. there is the simpler Way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and Converting of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Directory _ name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitioner: the string that is im! DOCTYPE day, like HTML Public / / / W3C / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantapSaul; after transforming the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first introduce these concepts to them, without their understanding & quantapplaud; little value.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three parts: global, locally and project. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantapt..</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolmaking through actions is all that is marked as a global, in the joint folder structure of & quantapplaud; this allows the group of administrators different to secure tools, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers to a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tools. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to tooling with special promotions designed specifically for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorment window, the building views, the cartoons with information and the toolbar. please beat in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the Karteirider with the right mouse button to receive a shortcut menu with the current document for passcodes, like close the current, other or all the party-rider, recharging, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right button in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the specified document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing of the mouse, using the mouse-cursor, or opening the file, when the string is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editing panel are the toolbar of the editor. at present, & equantapSaul; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of machine tools is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbar are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolmaking is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, for example & lt; then click on the icon that represents the day. now, you can insert the data for this just added tag. should it insert a tag that has several attributes (such as Anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction systems (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information & quantaplus; to navigate, they open and wander through. in the presentation with cartoons are available for files, project, sample files, document structure, attributes, and documentation components.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, which provides & quantapplaud. this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project by means of right click. actions such as Add, Delete, uploading or delete the files from memory medium can be carried out with the text-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option from & quantaplus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. it's all open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local assists only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates is in use.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about available scripts. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send with e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links to an element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. through right-clicking of an element it opens a list of commands with regards to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other side views. with it, some can change attributes and naming. this allows the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here's the complete documentation on the web-technology for your development to find. there can be pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two beaters at the bottom end of the window, using the beneficial information can be achieved: the intelligence window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This mapping is displayed information on any one in the Quanta ongoing script. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and any changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This diamond rider displays all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; Toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate box of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantapSaul.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantapSaul; sends the toolbar in an email. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can assure them in & quantapt. as any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; files to your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble passing from & quantaplus, you should check if your path is the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 at the PATH in front of her bin folder. same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantapSaul; is a web-development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a fast web-development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort, the best & HTML; -Editor to create, the developers began to employ & quantaplus; an independent, extensible Markup-language editor would be? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest Web-development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web-development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then you should be quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above needs to be held that & equantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the whole & kde; developer community is based not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantapSaul; allows web developers the use of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI). this can enhance automation almost every task. through the program comitters they can expand & quantaplus, without any interference with any scripting language tax. (more about them find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded into a well-engineered editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More information in detail documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; input, or remote center help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequel @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick overview list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not listed, whereby the oldest record is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project preset, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts with inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML, so that it is displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -assignment, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used to insert & URL; s used in the anchor per day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; pushbutton.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a hand number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages indicates!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined outpress to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Formation of the problem ters at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem-reporter is activated once you change to the structurtree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbols left of the main window on the left side of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, it will appear in the menu along with the submission or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu named after the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file (webjj).</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialogue to include files in the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folders or subfolder and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have further input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in Chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads of a project toolbar. these are stored in Project You / toolbar and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your tool. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be stored by means of settings... to be added to the toolbar, or you will be asked to save the toolbar you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of vision. this does not delete them from the disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">To send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to load devices to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Invite one & DTD; that you or any someone else has done and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; is sensible if the entities are to be drawn from the & DTEP; if this world is globally and a typist not present in the global KDE folder, it fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags, which are present in the loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is in the tags menu a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day admission dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -Specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disable the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; the inserting by toolbar failed when this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above-mentioned menu points. click on them. click on a activated plug-ins deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the synonomic mode for the current file. the list of available heresheiser schemata depends on derkate; version decreases.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of pointer identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for the developer. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD by using external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate convergence between the different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, the convertion sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the mapping mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu has an entry for each open window, with a selection of a setup, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches on the status of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog greatly affect any application, using the KHTML part, including the "Konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Sets the behavior of the editing pane. in the documentation of Kate Kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears when you delete entries from the toolbar, or what to add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the mouse setting in the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantapSaul; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the best from above to bottom, for example after filling in the project, the whole directory structure will automatically be completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small-case letters and without blank spaces with extension webstrej (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine on which you want to access, one, except you handle local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log. depending on the adjustment of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. when a joint collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and standard toolbar. if a joint collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. with serverseiling scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) you have to act differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Angehakt makes, if files, which are to be involved somewhere in the main folders of the project. if a project is started anew, not wet.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all the files and folders are displayed within the main ordners and you can make a precise choice of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by plugging or, by removing the hooks, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project-properties in the menu room in the subwindow profiles, or with the shortcut-short shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcard possible), which are reprinted on project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files that are listed in .cvindicated ore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The projector, which is loaded when opening the project. in fact, more about project reports can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This way the desired Debugger can be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed you can find in. the Debugger Plugin can be adjusted with the desired options. in the debug, the debug is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles upload high-load profiles (see in), as well as the display of a page overview for the content of the server for any profile, by showing your own subview of each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow events configuration, one can turn it into event actions and add these actions to change or delete. events actions are executed when a specific event occurs, such as the Glossy of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus, the last project that was open. however, this behavior can not currently affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantapSaul; closed, the project file will automatically be stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files happens. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The Project Manager gives free access to the files in the project. the files in the current project can be managed.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders inbehave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the high-site files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to removing the current profile. if only a longer exists a profile, the button is abused to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forget about it. this possibility is useful when common loading files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the record store -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog, if you change your mind before the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-air profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto different servers. when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that the files should be copied. either a fully qualified Domainname or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and stop.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. your password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be easily read, but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbar. it can give in a project many views, i.e. by simply means of exchange, various files and tools can be downloaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menue project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings Toolbars project toolbar, can be opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with whom one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the one's working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbar in & quantaplus; best to make use of the menu toolbar. use and add-in. adding toolbar to be added below in the section "Add Toolbars."</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new toolbar can be removed, the toolbar can rename or toolbar to be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions on this or other machine tools are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, in addition, the entries will remove action and display action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The machine tools and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool to set up... and settings are set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentary skeleton, code-carvers and files for interconnection. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a nasty filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or pack any existing directory in the template-tree. templates, in & quantaplus; in roughly the limitations one provides for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms used at the beginning of each pattern prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file excluding text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available under global templates. further information to the Template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in the template-tree under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted back on a template, but the same text area again and again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment using a final mark to Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the template-tree under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantapt..</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose file To save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project presentation) the template is not visible in the project tree; see the template-tree under project templates.</seg>

<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch if necessary to the source code Editor, in which the changes performed in the VPL; -editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that includes & php, shows a small green symbol the Vohandision of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor will continue to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode functions exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes are activated both in the code Editor and in the VPL; editor will be activated, this mode is already active, pressing the keypress in the active cursor from a window to another, where the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation unit between the VPL; -Editor and the source code Editor is set to set up via settings quanta. upon choosing VPL; you can also choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span. basically, the recommendation is recommended: a small spanish for fast machines and a large chip for slow.</seg>

<seg id="2221">Meta-tags permit the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. tags for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows the change of content, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword keyword-2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as possible with meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & # diff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributors were made many changes, and at the same time a lot of places has been corrected. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps the intrusion was changed. that changes the result was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; was able to display differences within a line and make changes to white character. later, a lot more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you would like to quickly compare text, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the previous window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and combined by folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way together is fully supported. this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the combination Editor under the differences windows allow the redeeming of conflicts and at the same time reveals the expected outcome. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Kisp3; also helps you with the comparisons and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-assembled:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Endiff3; displays the exact differences and controlled with it the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators become visible. if lines are only shown in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no trouble any more, if someone changes the reverse.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is identical, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red colour means both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the device's work easier by completely rewriting the filename of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordinary 1 Ordinary 2 Ordinary 3 Ordinary 2 Ordinary 2 Ordinary 3 Ordinary 3 Ordinary 3 Ordinary 3 Ordinary 3</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog enables the manual type of filenames, selecting via the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the list. you do not specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or later merge with folders. if for A one file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then uses & # diff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If the input field is active, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately set an output file. you can do this step later on saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & # diff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison then starts immediately. in Open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and derives, simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you'd just have to load two appropriate files, they are in & # diff3; then you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you cannot draw anything from & diff3; only the cloister of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreting and derive from text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the drawing number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest a while on the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source boxes are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the settings menu)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the color that file differs. if both files differ, the predefined color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (summarized) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the composite column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the color is not so important, it's useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the processor and in few, rare ones.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the clash-column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the display-sequence is activated, the line is displayed at broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the latest edition:, the filename and [changes] if you edit the result. usually, it contains it through automatic merge already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons, jump to a place of the unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line column is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be highlighted a jump of position in the windows where the start of the group is otherwise not visible.) This group is highlighted in the color background color for current field and each other on the left will appear a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic processing or manually copy a line in the file; no line is displayed in the Quelist; this text is only a wildcard for the event that you change your mind and perhaps re-choose another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a markings that you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; deployment conflict; appears, however, in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if in selecting the sources, ignore the options numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This navigates mainly with the images and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the window, you can use the arrow buttons, right, end, string, beginning and string, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the surpassable column next to the vertical image panel can be used by clicking also to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the window window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion button, you can switch between insertion and renaming mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the sequence columns synced the view of all windows on the beginning of each group (as already in the section together and the editable window appears).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture / Strg-Picture) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict, continue to solve as a conflict. therefore, between the redeemed and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings in the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Strg-C or Strg-inserting). if this option is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically copied into the clipboard and manually copy the manual copy. be careful with this option but careful, because you could write the content of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Index-ends are stored accordingly to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors do not use a pointless version\, and Win32-based systems are using car retrofit\\\\. Kdecker 3 does not keep the line files, therefore you should use & # diff3; also not use binaries files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically when you finish the file and restored at the next start. (menu setup - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog provides also writings with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences will be displayed in recursive writing. if the chosen script does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colours, some color could not be available in its pure form, but would be framed. on these systems the button-settings automatically represents an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When enabled, the tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or Return, the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard drops up then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which drawing type you prefer to save. the set value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">With the same of files tried & diff3; first to find all the completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step can be ignored the white character. the second step is compared each line. in this step white character will not be ignored. also, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a wagon mark '\' and a pointless version '\' at the end of a line, others again store only one newline copy '\'. usually, if this option is enabled, or if a white character is enabled, however, how a white character is dealt with. during the default, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default this option is disabled. in the first part of analysis you will ignore numbers and pertinent characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-'). in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very big files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic process mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next unsolved conflict will be jumped into.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolving automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (pre-employed is manual choice.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you're using this only from time to time, then use the automatic selection also conflict in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore ignore C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning the folders and run a merger. see for details under the link to the directory comparison and arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version already exists, then the original version is displayed .orig. if there is already a backup file with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you have to stop and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & Gdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately. if you activate this option, for all entries the upper setting is used.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding a short hint about what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has for you pure formal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpret. as the coding for each file is individually set, even files can be compared and combined with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding is to be saved for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define application commands, they might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the subtitle command can only be set with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Please turn it down to suppress provisioning changes in white characters in the text or review files. (note: this also applies to changes in figures or comments when the options are to ignore or ignore notice C / C + + -Comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection from A & lt; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; C is displayed beside the normal yet another second-circle column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines. simply drag the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu).</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window-menu).</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then choose immediately to finish the files together. a simple click launches the compilation and uses the filename of the last source file as a pre-specified name for the output file. (when this function is used to reboot) then the name of the last used file is kept.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. in & # diff3, then the output of the instruction is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut-out disruptive parts or to correct installation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first delivered to this external statement (see above), then the output of the instruction is specified only when drawing up this procedure. you can write your own pre-processor, which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each entry line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting the diff results. however, an external application is needed, and most users would not want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl totally sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processor command to convert the entry into upper case letters: sed's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ s. the\\ U is related to the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords in order to create automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyor\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BA</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in Kenz3. but it is good as an example for another application command line. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'each sign between' [and ']' is a hit, and each player will be replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple conditions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions apart. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different like e.g. perl. perl -p's / REGEXP / Erening / switch'allerdings include in perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the move '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor will maintain for the display and to bring together. further operations only change the data that can be seen in the index-line algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line-line-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor command are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or are hidden, you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & diff3; entire folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate this and shows the simulated changes without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only using the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparison and merge of individual files very similar. you only have to specify folders on the command line or in a dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folder are assembled, folder 1 is used as the base. if no target folder was specified, it uses & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not match that. to boot that, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will notify you a small news window on current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, that were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is closed, shows & kdiff3; a list of a list with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder of the scan found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can double-click a folder by clicking on the + / - clicking the arrow menu or by clicking the arrows to the left / right. the directory menu contains two subdirectories, containing all subdirectories of which you can open all folders or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file is immediately started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the datatype in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the datatype is different in other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merger version will not be automatically selected. if that is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above image are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow, and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the colour is also identical, although the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical when their entire content is identical. then, Folder also have the same color. with folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copying from B (or if B does not exist, extinguishing the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, extinguishing the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying from A (or if a does not exist, extinguishing the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): mistakes: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be run together.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): mistakes: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be run together.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories is active, then select & diff3; the necessary action to immobilise both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: together and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the output copied & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are activated, then select & diff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copying. if the files are different, but the same date appears. if the files are identical.. As long as such errors are not removed, the file may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When summarized, a file is processed after another. it status column shows ferent when the result was successful, and correspondingly other messages, if something was unexpected, you should make a last review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the dialog dialog, the file method is selected by the method of full analysis, Kdrives will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, solvent, not white and white conflicts. (the column for the redeemed conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merger actions (even in all subfolders), you can bring it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have the target folder, then it will be used in the three-folder mode, then the two-folder mode will be chosen and used for sync, A and / or B is used as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target folder, please check out if all entries should be in the target folder, also be displayed in the folder structure. there are several options that can be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unlovable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To complete all entries: select filesseduction and continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the scanning abbreviation): select action of the current element - or push F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options through, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose simulate if you want to see what would happen without which really changes are made. you will then get an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& # diff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a composite window will pop up (keep in mind the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again directories, continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & diff3; his work with the next entry continues.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & # diff3; on an error, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you see some error messages that can help you choose the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before going along with it.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been brought together individually, you notice & win 3; these entries (in the current session) and then bring them together again later. even if this has been summarised or not saved, those entries will be considered settled. only if you change the composite action, these entries will be squeezed once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & Bediff3; (menu settings - &gt; Cdecker 3 set up...) now has a section called directory co-operation with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that apply to the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. there are several pattern to be typed. separate wildcard: '*' and '?'. (for example * .cpp; * .h). the default setting is *. folder does not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be edited more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be edited more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have been a trader attribute. in other filesystems this option is as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be shown in the element tree, or not. this option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folder: if the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is switched on, the links such as normal folder will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & # diff3; not applied to possible recursions. a link to a folder of a link in itself would lead to a final loop and & diff3; crashes down.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solves, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and essentially slower when applied to files that contain no text. (insert an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders about a slow network, it is likely to compare only the change date and file size. however, this option will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the changel date. no real comparison will take place. the files are considered identical if they are equal. that can be useful for example when copying the changel date. please use caution. this option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode if two folder are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals are selected to match. also the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences occurring from which the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered unsure as the other file has not been changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another, then the original version becomes renamed and receives the extension .original. if an old backup file exists with .orig extension already, then this will also be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal compound of individual files, not just the composite folder. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder-connector could be visible from the composite separate files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the window directory & text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch through switching between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu, there is also an appropriate menu entry. if you save the result, the status will be put on completed and the file will not be squeezed once you boot the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will however be lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports networking with the help of KIO slaves. Kid 3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a repository with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should keep in mind:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undele. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mask. (# - &gt;% 23, blank - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit credentials or change date. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original is available. (please note the option of trusted the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose for use is currently as differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop always starts the built-in differences. to view Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In a diffuser-menu from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally the & diff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a part, it assumes & diff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files needs to exist. then starts & # diff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and can be seen from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original text exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since the production of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & # diff3; as part of the part, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar, and menu. that merge or the same of folders in the KPart Mode is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kid 2 (well Heist it Compare) already exist. besides, the name Kid 3 already indicates that it can be combined as the program diff3 from the Diff GUI-collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by watching in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have told the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be communicated to the correct prefix. in the default install configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interface (e.g., diff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white character is different, those lines are first treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines are next to each other, this type is this but this is is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice for every difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file, and it is much effort to create extra its own file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too large. you can restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is sudden; no src becomes linear; published and the text cannot extinguish. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Kisp3; used already many colors to highlight differences. even more downsizing would be confusing and lacking the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & diff3; use to, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use Kid 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You will find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To & Gdiff3; to compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command at the root folder of the & Bediff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is given the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & Ediff3; autoconf and automake should be used, you should not have any problems with compiling. nevertheless difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut off (Ctrg-X or rotary removal) copied to the clipboard and deletes the marked text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard to the current curve position and replaced the current marking system.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are displayed: files identical in all folders, do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version version, you have to re-read the folder after changes to the folder with the function Refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown that show differences. this also leads that identical files are not already copied into the target folder. if the target folder these files are not already included, they are missing after that. (the behavior will probably change later in a later program version) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result panel (if the lines are already present), they will be removed when clicking the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. undertones in individual signs (such as' A 'and' a '), as differences in white characters are dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual working spaces. it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the working space, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops, as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved inside of & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager, has been clicked, the contextual menu has only set up the two entries Pager, but has also appear the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries as minimizing, maximizing, on working surface and closing. the commands create the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only when applied to one application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only when applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this entry box is marked, windows can be shifted within the & kpager; s can be shifted with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in the & kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of virtual working spaces are displayed. it is made along with name to be displayed, the names are provided with folders, & eg. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the & kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs will be displayed as small window in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces are displayed to make their selection possible.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple right corner with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and pixel map showing a small view of the actual program window. note: pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager; -main window will be determined: classic leaves & kpager; in some other windowders, as out of Pager applications in some other windowders, horizontally, all virtual desktops shows in a horizontal row and vertically positioned in a vertical row, which is very well suited for representation on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini-Miniprogram in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be altered in size, display windows as symbols or with their content, and it also runs outside the control panel.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click of the mouse button within & kpager; and close-down selection of switches... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or VI. If you don't want to login to the file, you need to login to your system administrator or log in to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package base base, you need a functioning installation of the KDE-packages.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse-cursor in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button depressed, so you can draw the contents of the magnifier window and move. this also goes with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift, button-pressing or using the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& moumousetool; emulates a click on the same spot as the mouse cursor. it is meant to help people suffering from repetitive peness Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click pain. besides, it may emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& mousesetool; may handle the pain that comes with clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can also use pain that are linked to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if the mouths tool helps avoid pain, which can be caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain, which is caused by the payment due to the mouse, and as applies to all ergonomic aids: the result can be different for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & moumouseool is simple: & moumousetool; monitor your mouse movements and runs a mouse click if you cut the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart moving activating, makes & colmousetool; a pause, after it emulates the mouse button. move now the mouse, it waits until the end of the movement, before the letting go out of the mouse button. this way, you can perform the pulling off the mouse button. the smart moving requires a little practice, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This weighttime period has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before & moumousetool; one mouse click).</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smarter switched on, the torque field is active (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time is set, the & moumousetpool; after downloading the mouse button is waiting, before it leaves the mouse button again, if there is no notice of the mouse on the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function is activated, now supported by mouse clicks. if this function is activated, a slow connection to right and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. a slow connection to the left and back leads to a double-click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; however, it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can shorten the reaction time; go to sound & Multimedia, choose the sound system and here the rider genera. there is a slider sound-buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, this setting is marked with & kmousetool; at any start from & kde; this feature is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values that have been open to opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button for users, the settings will be reset on the status of the application by the application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It's best to use & moumousetool; initially with the presets. especially the intelligent shifting you should first get off. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later get the smart moving.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to decrease the response times by & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect will remain: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on jobs in the browser window which does not constitute a link, does not lead to unlimited reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckled, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the mouse-ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse varies. it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks out the execution of & moumousetool; if you have just started running the smart one, it means that & moumousetool; the operation can no longer stop by letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & moumouseool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is to execute just a click. by this, the status of & moumousetool is reset, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & moumousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor in place where you want it. but do not park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you're looking for scanning. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are protracted. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart moving, but I don't manage to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart moving is an advanced feature of & moumousetool; and it takes time before you can deal with it. it is very well possible to copy it in the clipboard and re-insert any other promotion, in case you want to move the mouse with the right mouse button. however, some advice will be given to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart temper not, if you just begin to use & moumousetool; select text instead: execute the switch button down, while you hover the mouse on the other end of the text and enter the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Therefore, use the audible mouse click. this way it gets jdesmal, if & moumousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when with the intelligent shifting the difference time begins. later you can use the smart moving also without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & moumousetool; use, the XTest-extension for & X Window; be installed. that should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a soundcard and loudspeaker. it is set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& moumousetool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse-cursor is short-harmed. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and those creating the mouse keys.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering the text is dealt, before it will be sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for enhancing the pronunciation, to select false words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to bypass certain deficiencies of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is presumed to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the extended orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the warning output.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Breaking news have the next highest priority. a message breaks down normal text. & kmouth; is an example of application, the news used. while you & eg have a long text on a website read, you can go with & mouth; someone who is just entering the room. & nbsp; alerts are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. each order you run from the mapping card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text entries. text entries are intended for the output prolonged texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four levels of order are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen Readers, during & ktts; just such pre-reads, this issue will hold and terminates.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters can never be applied to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text entries as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter will work on the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are made as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the set parts can be delivered either as words or as a regular expressions. & ktts; is delivered with pre-defined strings as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Shift use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) around & XML; used by a format to a different format. included in the delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Interphone Cellularline, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; for example, if you have set on a speaker card for example, you can read text from KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter appears that its rules do not apply, it gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; alerted on board; will be sent by all the activated filters on the page below. the processing of the filter is made in order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filters. if a filter does not be crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be removed from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown below the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of strings, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. these patterns are exchanged in the text, then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Insert a name for your filter. you can select this name for any number, but you only have to distinguish from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the order from above to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Using these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries from the file to the existing list are attached.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If here is a value entered, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>

<seg id="2646">The character set filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if all conditions are empty. if all the input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared with words, the sign-chain filter filter regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be reduced by partitions (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no guide to writing regular expressions. if you have the & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs to add or edit them as help to arrange this expressions. the & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; printouts can be found in the package.</seg>

<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text to the filter is covered, there is a spokesman for the text. the speaker is sent by the speaker properties, which the program proposes to the text on & ktts; to speaker the speaker at the Cartoon Card, you can write the speaker to the speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode. before, all options are gray only, which means settings can only be considered. in the system administration mode, you can access by clicking the button 'button' mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>

<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology will be given, in the second part all of the & knetworkconf file will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace more detailed knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is introduced into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large distribution. from IPv6 is expected to penetrate this description in the near future. this description focuses therefore on the IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is to assign. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the contact point provided that a valid IP address is provided or, if available, DHCP can be used. definitely, the IP address can not be chosen easily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a dedicated small (home) network, the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses in the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so their any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the maharness is mostly set to 255.255.255.0, so all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = one's own computer). the standard route is required for the IP-forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The power station 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files, which are affected by & knetwork.conf, and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content is set to be set there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the bandindexfile with the belt content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is created a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder in which the backup should be done. the list of native files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under backup files, the files only contain files that are stored on the same filesystem, as the folder. folder, which lie on other filesystems, you can apply separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar. this causes all files to be saved and a new snapshot is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons are set; and lt; and, files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings via the KDat menu item... in the menu settings, you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-remodeling option of the bandman.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & backup; before the tape is bound, the command gets load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or tycooperations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option turned on, try & Do; to block the throw at the belt drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all bandman works.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the loosening of the incorporation of & f-date; automatically the belt is chopped. use this option not with floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option turned on, try & deny; the harddisks are able to change variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you have to say & backup; in any case the blocksize for your band's drive will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & Do; a band formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file will be composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is calculator: seconds, whereby hosts the full name of the system is formatted on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kfile folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that let themselves be directly connected to & GNU; even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; the program is suitable for system protocols. the program is accessible for inexperienced users, where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users support quick access to the example of information on issues that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what makes your computer in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users support quick access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the screenshot of the screenshot, & ksystemlog; features are available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filtered and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the system of system log; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol is not displayed, and it opens up instead of its small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely will not be executed with system managers. the protocol files typically find in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selection criterion or after a string. the list of log files will now be displayed automatically, so that only the log-line contains the entry for the selected filter. then a protocol line contains only shown if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Here you can also select another entry. the string string of the filter search will be selected only with the entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol column, select the name of a process, so shows you & utility log; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a showy color as protocol lines of the level note. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Do you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can trace the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "in addition, you can activate the" "" "Next" "" "option to display new lines in the context menu of the main window in order to display all the new added protocol lines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have chosen a subwindow, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you can find further current information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& nbsp; log; also find in the following folder of & kde; subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more well-known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops into the standard for monitoring the program starts at the flood of the system in the & Linux world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time it is more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not below / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V Init without making a reinstallation and re-formatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start when driving the system or switching to another round level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setters, which will only once run. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, even if there are actually not much use of it. you can also create a rc.an in / etc / rc.d if you want to run out a bit, what has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runtime is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line in the initial area as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column, and you will probably find that the default running level 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have a mistake, then you will be repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the proper scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that no real files are located in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? simply: any of the scripts is written so it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name and when the one is included, the script is called with the argument stop. if he contains a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set themselves a simple way of building machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level, which is only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., in addition, I could have a user-running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; using a mouse or another hand device is simple to fail to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six rounds to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running leveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. besides, the entry is removed from its original Runtime (or its location). this will only happen if they draw an entry from the field of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to select them merely on a new runway, you need to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The number of entries from one item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the Sorrows of the surrounding entries before you can try again to submit the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore data, which were thrown in the trash. be therefore cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another round level, move it with out-cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired running level with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the number of goods or the name of an item manually, press the button button to switch between different fields. simply close the dialog by pressing a button to accept the changes, or push Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before it will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; otherwise, changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts anew. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have set some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you must edit any extra files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual after.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way for system services can be launched in these distributions, does not simplify the configuration of the proprietary programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without a message if its configuration files are not present or wrongly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runtime so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user user; 1.0. with this program, you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save them. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry / save in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& Guser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two mapping cards, the user and user support list. to edit the user's desired users or the required group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user account and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some mapping cards are only represented if you have made advanced system settings. only if you have space restrictions (Quota) for users, a mapping card will be created, where you can make individual settings, if shadow - passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd like being installed in BSD-Unices.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The mapping administration is published if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like being installed in BSD-Unices.</seg>

<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for any filesystem. the current file system is selected using the filesystem path using space restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The mapping group informs about the group activity of the chosen user. the standard group, which the user belongs, you will find in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
