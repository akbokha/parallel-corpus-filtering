although I visited the USA for at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have danced to American music , read American writers and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had profound effects on me that I was mainly because of an American cinema .
at the age of 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , who played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican , a fri@@ ght@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ d covered the murder@@ ous conspiracy of a oil magn@@ ates who wanted to fill the Supreme Court of judges who were opposed to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if it is the absolute truth , I forgot everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I said always : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance within a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very warm love letter written about its size .
then , Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me , how he is surrounded with its min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks , such as a former colleague , expressed it and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , African American , and women .
nevertheless the people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes which he won in the Republi@@ can election , was the highest number formed by the party nom@@ inate candidate .
I was spee@@ ch@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t get Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ torate in line with the people I met at Phoenix during my time .
like for example , my professor , Dr Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , percei@@ ves people from all over the world , a profound human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ umps World views do not correspond with that of Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I had met us with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
l@@ umps ins@@ ure is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr , who struggles for her life for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family , which treated me like her son .
nor does she fit to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then , there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose direct advice has helped me a lot with my career .
these people and they embo@@ died through them in depth my love for America .
as Tr@@ ump initi@@ s his way to the nomin@@ ee of Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to overlook this things , broke me almost the heart .
maybe it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as racism .
to sub@@ ordinate people , said one of my friends , is exactly what brought us to that situation .
that is superf@@ ici@@ ally and dis@@ respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which are most white , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they would like to regain control of a country which she has disappointed ?
in other words , they would perhaps say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who re@@ charge the cruel decision to look down a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( T@@ m. ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ aning of the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vocabulary from white in bac@@ kl@@ ash to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sk@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was the great Van Jones , has just been killed , what America has done so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have , America is all welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America , after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan a vocabulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a vo@@ iced &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood the quantity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; did Lat@@ ino have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answer them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God to Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ umps land , told the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find any place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

out of the aff@@ liction to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love of music by waste
the &quot; recycled instrument Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music School of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that music which is played in both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the br@@ ink of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is popular among tourists but is far from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a sym@@ ph@@ ony orches@@ tras played by children and adults in the sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments have found a way to overcome them .
a music school with 100 students is a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ den @-@ violence .
but it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot which started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope .
the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of the school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they will go through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
you will always come laughing and with brilliant eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest , l@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura play - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital is - on instruments produced from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ char@@ ted instruments , made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where recycling under management of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the waste into instrument .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , remember the initial time :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin from waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on the instruments of a re@@ char@@ ted material and which is called The recycled Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest people like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publication is part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was well @-@ known that this ship had already been operated in li@@ ber@@ ian waters illegal fishing before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were below accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legislative re@@ bre@@ cher of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to sacrifice one of their har@@ b@@ ors and refused to give him a fishing event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior assistant of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team who discovered and followed the ship at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices inter@@ sect and safegu@@ ards was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 certified by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , who at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden if it is extremely difficult to det@@ ecting it . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by inten@@ tional dis@@ regard to existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate equilibrium .
however , while promotions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow @-@ fired combined with the information between individual countries , the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea using satellite channels .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fishing in forbidden areas . also , so susp@@ ects that a ship invites its prisoners on the way to other ships .
ideally , such surveys can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on their way and possibly also whether they have a criminal balance .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , can deny the acceptance of such vessels in their ports , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to over@@ head pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing will not be worthwhile anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i supports it .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in total sales , which over@@ pass the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade in eastern African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing , which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world . under these also illegal fishermen .
among other practices , including actions are like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of ph@@ antasy , the fishing @-@ protected species and the fishing in nature reserve areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are targe@@ ting the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could be illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t speak my harbour too &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front functions .
since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it has criminal networks revealed that had distributed counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has been tr@@ acked and found ring@@ ing ships .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to detect ships of precise vessels .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps to enumer@@ ate the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects various information levels to each other . it is supposed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminals in larger precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations do actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth in common with Google and the marine reserves Oce@@ ana opens the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite channels and can be viewed through the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trusts has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals , they also terri@@ fy them .
ships that were formerly scattered without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now experienced a 33 % rise in fishing sales , since then buy fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 found the inspec@@ tors there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited .
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa a few hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , the so called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the target of even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state in Somalia could announce his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under wrong flag - and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen of Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong mark that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works across the entire world ocean .

the street movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum against the president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela has rejected the amendment of the opposition to a referendum for referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the debate on the political and economic crisis of the country , entering the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also held in other parts of the country - amongst others in the residential area Bar@@ inas , in the MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in central @-@ north @-@ located Bundest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute shortage of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the prospects of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change , but in the end , the management of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , concludes :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , where the inflation and powers of violence are among the highest ones all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is time to Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday , and further civil strike and on the 3rd of November all to Caracas on the Miraflores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator that calls through the Guardian signs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect itself from the government and the government of the government , according to its own statement .
hours later they could certainly leave the cathedral but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstrators were trying to hold the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ ser T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry the tubes , because otherwise you could see something that many national parks do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already doing the level of repression per day :

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba .
as the meantime , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the frame of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not chosen for his life .
starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military ations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he has suffered enough .
34 years he held the secret of the secret for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was all right .
I felt like a secret .
as a child of 15 years you do not notice that you will be manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and murder@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ciful . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced over the years the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who spoke before a covenant of his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chooses for himself a way of salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was struck with a boy who made combat sport .
all n@@ essed him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , asking me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t waste you one day and I must save you .

therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my Father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , propaganda , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ There ro@@ id the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in the year 1976 .
during the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to emig@@ rate . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just about anything .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little wrapped in a blan@@ ket and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great ch@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were put down and entertained me with an watch@@ post .
suddenly he pointed out an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wn in and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found that it was attached to it by the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was just captiv@@ ated there .
she rarely had a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ shot him with water and compl@@ ained him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the k@@ ank there in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later when my father stood under house arrest , he got the same smell from his room .
I realized the smell instantly and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I wondered : how is it possible that someone can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ i didn &apos;t know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he carried me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated by hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were exposed and t@@ ented .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also being tried in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face down - everyone was captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people stood still on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted , that I saw the prisoners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and were killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed .
( according to data @-@ controlled civilians , the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former folding chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you &apos;ll see that they took about this course and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names have been changed and they were given a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the formation of up came that they should be displaced .
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the out@@ pouring of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War ute &apos;
my Father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as it was named &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was up with the military later - I was in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that the war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign , which you dis@@ continue to combat an enemy .

but when you go to a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is no war @-@ mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could help with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officers of the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once called he asked me a criminal , and I said , and you that you are standing cars on the road ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in anger , and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you personally .
so we need no one else !
that was my father .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process I showed a photo of then , on which I bore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father made from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes home .
back then the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators accused me of this crime . I resist , no problem , they can put me the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway , to hide .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I find Re@@ ue .
I have children . if you have children once , you can recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognise that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so good , you have been ex@@ cl@@ ted during the dictatorship of people , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children deri@@ ve from ?
one day my father brought a girl home , his mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I reck@@ on , it was simply chosen to kill these people . but what their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families where they could hand over their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearing of the cor@@ pse is the final ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced when democracy was introduced back to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been crus@@ hed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you never find something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something of course remains always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought , showing my father , arose during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest .
I made him dis@@ credit for all the atrocities that I had to experience .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I do not know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt uns@@ killed and wondered what the whole over@@ run patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me about that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed dre@@ ad@@ ful crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
he has disgu@@ sted only &quot; Na then &quot; g me . &quot;
this is what I did .
in 2010 I restore the first ad .
I had finally realised that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can dict@@ ate to me that I am taken . I have finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing at the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , unconventional freedom of imprisonment in 15@@ 4 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 @-@ year child .

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the range of sizes of the Ur@@ part .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process ended due to the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1978 .
43 sub @-@ op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the Court hang@@ ed in 28 cases lifel@@ ong arrest and in nine cases prison quarters between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .

all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian workers .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court is a historic milestone for all human rights organizations who have worked for years for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 @-@ founded in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but research for them lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argent@@ inian government survived the country on which La Per@@ la was , so that a memorial could be established , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation mistake does older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
arrangement of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his guide , last month witnesses a very special translation .
on a shield , the Japanese word on Earth ( Cor@@ ei@@ ll@@ sha ) , the &quot; older &quot; motor@@ ists , &quot; may be mistaken - maybe also by means of goats &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; when &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; was translated .
the wrong translation was from the 1st to 20th of September to read electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local time @-@ newspapers .
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; H@@ ula &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable , though not entirely correct term &quot; el@@ der &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Foundation applied for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the bug was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely hope that older people were offen@@ ded by the poor correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News continued to be a bit more extensive with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , the country are involved in accidents , but quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto &apos;s pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 oun@@ ds of sen@@ iors . this represents a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share of 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents declined altogether , the proportion of damage caused by sen@@ iors caused during the same period .
the name not named re@@ porter in the published version of article comments at the light that show what prejudices some Japanese apparently he@@ ges against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo through the translation errors has been the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How fla@@ wed , the translation is actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so prevalent in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery du@@ g for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo from Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for crossing , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to learn active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with mother tongue . in general the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the language language - should be native language .
that is how a French mother language should be translated from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue , the translations into English . this may result in lacking understanding of excessive , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have any foreign staff , can make translations nevertheless operate in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ s and pu@@ zz@@ ling sets which arise by machine translation , show that this technique is not yet to replace a human translator for a long time . this holds true for several languages .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo from Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or from government who have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serial source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors take on the internet and television
head of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , the 7th of April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they could not have access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet sites were no longer accessible from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV .
other online radio stations rus@@ hed to the protests of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who oppose the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was folded , and recommended to U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it appears that Internet sites ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ischer providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ zol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have hesit@@ ant since 2014 in reporting about protests . at that time , the commission threatened with telecommunications and lock@@ ings , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , given the Commission to call this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
astonishing that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ ia confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other on @-@ line radio stations . this also concerns the website that the National Assembly has over its meetings .
previous post @-@ research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local internet provider will have to use DNS . this is a technique based on the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds or deny the request when calling for such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third kn@@ itted channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who had crossed the protests in Caracas live in detention .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in custody .
he was released eight hours later he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government has regulated the Internet connections , thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media reporting on the current events in the country is still impe@@ ded .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to obtain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects witnesses of other crimes that have been used just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; horizontal cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which she was not able to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in this house never was treated like a daughter .
when she became ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money handed over their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children do not have to pay for a countless day household work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a treaty which you cannot be lifted up .
the practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the involvement and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witnesses , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against Cri@@ adi@@ ta is guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is the family that their daughter believe in believing that they will be able to complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl and justify their exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise receive no training and perhaps even star@@ ve .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is cra@@ fted , his family will experience it only many years later .
sometimes they have experienced them even before .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon found in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen homes , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed a lot of heavy pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in the house of V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck us as long as a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the young girl &apos;s life .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the Jewish child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Gesellschaft of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest , and demanded that there could be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay is more cows than children registered , &quot; mour@@ ned Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for an excellent investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be indic@@ ative - for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , went bank@@ rupt and lost her father his work .
their brothers had to go all working and started to sell in the street or the market of sweets for earning money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , they had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepare breakfast for her employer .
Friday for example puri@@ fying the fridge , mu@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ inf@@ used the floor .
when the school was at an end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more they had done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had even had dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to go hungry , but didn &apos;t get an un@@ bound@@ ed meal . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the landlord &apos;s library to eat as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ e@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings of the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and to read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media through the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not keep up with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had someone who listened while he spoke about politics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn to &quot; bad habits &quot; there . thus , they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ Ã­ , would be home to their native Guaran@@ i .
their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had enabled her to lose again , explains them .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , paid with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never talked about , har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that somebody who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly clear that I was not part of any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company che@@ ers the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please en@@ list yourselves .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman caught out of the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ gh@@ tly . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the inland that would like to work . &quot;
then the fi@@ bers in the display turned out once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look at it works with her .
thank you , I do write again if something is .
the store was complete .

legis@@ lators told Egyptian users in social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain C@@ C@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently agreed a draft legislation to &quot; regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
if it is adopted by the Parliament , beneficiaries , and users of social media have to register with a governmental authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law a place would be set up , giving citizens a permission to give people permission to use social media .
within six months of adoption of the law , users would have to register with their correct names and recruitment numbers in order to enable social networks .
will there be failed to do this , so that could cause a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a money @-@ book .
the draft bill which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ons and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any we@@ aving application , which runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video , and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities want to account the users and users the registration . unclear is also the fact that the Egyptian government is unable to register for regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Aman@@ dus , Parliament members and sponsors of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a us@@ ername and a password from the telecommunications Ministry , and a password &quot; to move through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook block . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to obtain information about their identity in order to access the network .
yet it is not so far known that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of je@@ d@@ no authority in Egypt regarding things to do with technology .
in my opinion , they suggest that just as they can control viol@@ ently physical public and private spaces it could be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will establish a strong monitoring system to apply citizens r@@ allies , who apply for permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to engage in a court process .
this is technically not at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in legislative and constitutional committees before it enters into the plenary session .
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military hierarchy in parliament , whose sense is maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no devi@@ ation of fiction is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ k proposed a legislative base for cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong prison sentence was intended to be found guilty of the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal @-@ prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of leop@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they find less and less boot@@ y .
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only tran@@ ged prey in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large rob@@ bery is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards really is low in the wild and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore states that they have a shot of a great cat in cam@@ af@@ all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure pleasure .
as pic@@ tured Biolog@@ o , R@@ aza passionate a different aspect of their country , which not only consists of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies for wild animals living animals and on educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the region of Kurdistan .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the advances made in the past six years have been hit to rebuild the lives of those who were hit by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had spar@@ ked the disaster .
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a Pre@@ f@@ ect Pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan northeast , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring regions of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had ev@@ acu@@ ated whole coastal cities of the map .
even more , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , and already had to leave 160 000 inhabitants from their homes .
the special report by Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows which progress has been reached after six years , in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare farm@@ houses ( in the evenings , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate .
for the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could record , 80 percent of the planned spare homes were finished .
Iw@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima makes the final light with 70 percent of the final light .
at the same time , one always strive for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ u ( in the event , cas@@ c@@ it@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement homes .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 thousand people were forced to live in accommodation shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate in such pers@@ istence .
almost 40 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 per cent of ev@@ ac@@ uation supplied after the disaster in tourist shel@@ ters , were settled in final houses .
for Iw@@ ock , the number is here at 34 per cent .
pre@@ f@@ ect of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
as the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to establish 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools that were affected by the disaster , its doors by December 2016 was re@@ opened , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ect states is much more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while nearly 100 per cent of fishing villages in Iw@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing villages have res@@ umed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have drawn up a large scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ arian agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of crops in Iw@@ ata and less than 50 percent of arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only one consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed in arable lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear waste area . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of Pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered over again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still stays far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ata are again at 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent here .
however , Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants , it &apos;s more difficult to find their living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to establish an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the indigenous people and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their emp@@ t@@ lements changed over against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article explains the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents who have taken action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in matters of disasters .
as it is about those who had ev@@ acu@@ ated the fu@@ eling from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture .
in their edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also directed its attention to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and disastrous ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disaster relief , nuclear accident , the Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 thousand people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , were settled in long @-@ term spare homes .
according to the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are still older than 50 years old . they fail to bring back in correct expe@@ ditions because efforts to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people encounter people from other countries , speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , however , you often see that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that have often received less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices Members who recall a moment that they have felt very strong connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i is talking about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time the love of the music has consolidated the lack of common language skills during a journey in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b addresses his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma , after he collap@@ sed by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
to the right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care centre : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stri@@ ker against the head . nationwide , millions of prot@@ esters took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s studied , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors carried him on this Saturday and have put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
the face of the police officer is to recognize the face of the police officers , who attacked with a le@@ aning . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been completed by an active service in case of an active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his blows at the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officers were logged by a demonstr@@ ator and land in the intensive ward , his face would look for six months on TV and the entire oppression would thus be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press @-@ channel from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video on the net , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edic briefly pointed out to it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the below clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus on the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who live in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to remain at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times into social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he was sab@@ otage the Occup@@ y School by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an , who has attacked him by a poli@@ cem@@ an .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil when it came to brutal Police in the past Friday .
polic@@ emen took a stage in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstrators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber bul@@ lets and l@@ ur@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked the police to give up violence against demonstrators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has dis@@ missed the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a paper@@ back glass window in order to design their title @-@ page illustr@@ ative with a photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a dis@@ continuous wind@@ shield , than about the protests of thousands who serve to defend a special cause .
this must also acknowledge that if one is strictly opposed to any kind of kind damage .
the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is also an absurd , un@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are fal@@ si@@ fied by headlines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Ex@@ clu@@ sive villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso included almost hundreds of sugar cane plants in all of Cuba the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly referred to as el Central - in Spanish su@@ gars - known regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar @-@ harv@@ ests on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar tube factories .
after the ground@@ ing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its investments , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ invent itself .
some change the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that are still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , which is up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar be@@ et factories in the east of the region , who have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene did not remember exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ ale I would obtain the sugar ro@@ hr@@ ates , but the promise has not been held .
the su@@ gars industry have already contradic@@ ted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest is already no more news .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched ?
the old railway junction of the municipality looked even better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 @-@ sugar mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became im@@ portable to the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
only they left the factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations , as well as the rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar rates increased just about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the administrative and food organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the present production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw @-@ sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar plants , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the Swe@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez since 1967 worked in the factory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , says about the closing of the factory , the word he says most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
thus the place will be preserved , they set up a full @-@ time working group .
before the first end of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would be removed only in terms of the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could author@@ ise every decision .
since then the responsibility was passed and the letters were always more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the tac@@ kled factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operation in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will in the still@@ ation of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most well developed industrial area of Cuba and major workplace producers has been er@@ ased .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for work and services which the plants generated in the municipalities where they were found .
we will never know if the Mam@@ mut talk of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present people , as he assured that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar tube factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has only been extracted high by the elections .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ ale I learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar ro@@ hr@@ ates closed , or better said than they began to pick them up , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted , this disadvantaged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy have had to seek other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the Factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty received the old soldiers a r@@ ente of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a thoughtful person , nevertheless , he gives the lies that he told him not .
they have been tor@@ ment for over ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years old in R@@ ente , not because it lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations youngsters use Hi@@ p Hop in order to express their own culture
photo of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
people of the First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with issues that are important to them . they do this using Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 Work@@ shop@@ pers bring directly to schools and youth centers to teach you@@ thful song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in northern Quebec with ten cre@@ e community and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop reveals that the young participants in talks on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance , or whatever comes in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. federal state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , explains the story of the highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in West@@ can@@ ada , where almost two dozen men usually disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , even though the young people not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has taken , the chor@@ us is sung on cre@@ e .
the young people involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a St@@ anz@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is at your disposal St@@ anz@@ he , just as a translation into English , translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you are going to take our cry
because as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that one day we will raise one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
in this way , they can grow and as well as our youth are going forward
so they can do what they determined by the Creator

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are placed near the entrance hall san@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u ( where the &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) is displayed by every dish that serves in this restaurant .
customers will see this plastic gifts and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry devoted to making these plastic gifts .
in the mu@@ til@@ ted district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a for over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese people these plastic products are so common that they don &apos;t even fre@@ t them any more . however , a new trend is transformed today into a show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in the special sale : new equipped with plastic shelves as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ant magnets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ g refriger@@ ant magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ als will become more and more complex .
in this case , a ca@@ ste @-@ don has been transformed ( a popular travel bag with seafood ) into a mobile @-@ state support .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile @-@ handed cord .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo .
and here is an apple that does capture your mobile phone :
designed to see how an apple can be seen , with a candle for the cell , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing t@@ inge .
some mobile @-@ handed and mobile @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ gens is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say to you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can provoke my mobile phone with salmon @-@ ro@@ gens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic gifts can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile phone @-@ stand has the shape of mel@@ on ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried black salmon .
further sk@@ id plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ches blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # on the evening of the evening .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to spreading the restaurant industry . like for example with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic is actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the desol@@ ate and cum@@ bers are regularly appearing in statistics . but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which this struggle brings .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the bere@@ av@@ ed or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every cor@@ pse , behind any bone fund in the hundreds of en@@ closures , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trafficking ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who have ri@@ v@@ ed in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not just allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug sellers and all communities therefore have to ride many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the angu@@ ish of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life changes &quot; ) relates exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks out every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which in just one day lost their father , their four si@@ blings , her husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we also prepare ourselves today for the task we have placed to go away , and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he was going back again , but he never came back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
you are the assurance of my father , but it didn &apos;t get them out , because the mort@@ gage require a mort@@ gage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con of Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only need to show the faces of those who fear to fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and government leadership .
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what type it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come by newspaper ki@@ osk every day and see the title @-@ pages with images that can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I &apos;m the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different at all or consider this normal .
it writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) wants him when he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets .
for me it is like those who have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear that they too have happened to them .
I see our weakness if stories are exposed to mere figures in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor to be justified by that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ plac@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to get involved that they will be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months Er@@ tor@@ tion in the capital city district . &quot; in it , it describes how armed criminal month was pressed by their business until they end up not only the business but also had their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never pass , the trauma will remain , the fear comes back high , if you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether I would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ es , I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation signed by force . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missed wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a watch@@ ful and he tells him that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas , tor@@ tillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for all the life of violence that she had to learn to live .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ pse of his father who was shot by armed men by a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw such a :
in 2006 Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence through organised crime and the struggle against it was mixed with the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of Ministers on public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the Pro@@ sec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some of the hundreds of thousands of thousands , who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade them into the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the data journ@@ alistic project initiated the data journ@@ alistic project of Nar@@ co@@ data . its aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , include images , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or for@@ gery .
but what is the first time after the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible un@@ failing seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release it was mis@@ lead , used to be@@ g trage@@ dies which have actually happened in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a petrol trucks left the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . there came 230 people around life .
after the civil war , Africa had been neglected in Africa &apos;s second country , and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous paths of swe@@ aters , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the victim of the petrol trucks fell victim .
administration officials described a fire@@ ball , the mu@@ ende homes , including a movie in the vicinity , which was full of people , which set the soccer championship .
houses mixed and hung@@ ered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to death .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users my@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make the grey scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of shortened body that are mat@@ ured on the ground while people are watching them .
but here the story does not stop her end .
over the years the same photo was noted several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , though they may be attributed to real trage@@ dies in connection with regard to the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically by atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down , and cor@@ pse is in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ appearing , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be pic@@ tured .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was correctly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ chie@@ vous application of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented immigration to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments , such as this example , correctly sli@@ pped the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in relation to arguments .
the painting from San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Cru@@ ci@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a review , published by the United Nations , those who could flee , rape and a number of deaths , some could burn by combustion .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , such as the following , who assembled these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 asser@@ ted that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to write this information .
the original article , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations who called AF@@ P as their source , also had wron@@ g@@ ly written Th@@ ein being written this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false data
traces of these false cou@@ pling reach back to the years of 2011 and 2012 and actually come back from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can see how far information can be crossing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures found , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent wrong reports , others have tried to expose the counter@@ fe@@ iting .
we have shown examples of the impro@@ per use and associated with the respective countries on the basis of which side they had been published . thus , we want to be more clearly defined than by the language alone .
of the countries listed below ( which are linked in some cases ) can date several examples of abuse .
here are some cases which can now be fully awakened ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
samples from false Cop@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries refer to pages or servers , about the examples of counter@@ fe@@ iting or fal@@ si@@ ders are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples , according to the met@@ adata and information available about Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ ging examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
this article identifies a blo@@ gger from Quebec City not only the Fal@@ se , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the Democratic Republic of the Congo related to Nigeria as well as further questions according to the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies in them ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nig@@ est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the part of the city is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica is cited as its source of the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( which is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am like this one who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atrocities of Islam , &quot; clearly did not see any pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which refu@@ te this .

even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Congo has been considered as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in public discussion groups .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for a mis@@ chie@@ vous application of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand , expresses a blo@@ gger , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger that pursu@@ es the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are tr@@ acked , since however the photos of this were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Obama administration published a mission statement on what it appeared as &quot; pur@@ pose@@ fully fin@@ alized news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot;
this moist@@ ur@@ ing , which is published exclusively in English includes also references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ aires who operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and run by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and the other ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by bur@@ ial nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clari@@ fies that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims , which Christians kill .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar was orda@@ ined in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from San@@ ge .
the article has been updated in 2014 and the image continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings but it claims that there is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later coinci@@ ded with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo has emerged , provided with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims under the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking on these events , the mut@@ in@@ ant in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages linked with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that supposedly was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , there continued discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to be false .
from the Embassy in which the image was contained from the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data agreements with UR@@ Ls and time@@ - / Dat@@ alog@@ ical stamp exist on the web@@ sit@@ ters and occasional them have a picture @-@ name in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original release of 2010 , the image ultimately might be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) who pass these post@@ ings . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the upheav@@ al of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the de@@ priv@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming will use the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth checking how images are used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who are inten@@ tional to seize the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ gesting this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and tasted the real atro@@ city from what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar .
the spread of tremendous images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that rejection of images of a ref@@ usal equ@@ ates , to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise and accept them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the studied , such as violent media to help others ) .
while there is a lot regarding rap@@ amer writing in the news media , fact is that it is essential for today &apos;s news reporting .
follow techn@@ ologists as with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will need to contem@@ plate thoroughly about situation in which a picture can suggest something that is actually also derived from the context or completely mis@@ chie@@ vous kind can be used .
any investigation of false grants should also take into consideration how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg@@ . un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ) makes every effort to provide language enthusiastic to a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ k@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ isting stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt at an easy translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have already been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find example words from Van@@ u@@ at@@ u for example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ h you for your parents in recognition of how to make you effort in your recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ creen language spoken in parts of Brazil as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Com@@ fort@@ abl@@ eness , or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after spending cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ use other cultures , revealing other ideas and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even want to show more this &quot; insur@@ able word &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to download their favorite sw@@ ath here .

how Sri Lanka is surrounded with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster of the decade
the is@@ le state of Sri Lanka is currently the worst of the most severe water and lands@@ li@@ disaster in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ soon , who normally uses the end of May , are replaced by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 bor@@ ough@@ s in the south and west of the country over the bank .
after an opinion of the Kat@@ astro@@ ph@@ enz@@ burg of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are mixed .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 secure places .
the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water @-@ distances in some areas went slowly back .
the population health and hygien@@ ic experience represents a massive challenge in the affected areas affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster :
floods in Ta@@ vern near Ta@@ vern near to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kan deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ vement crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle also over@@ flooded due to the last overweight water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has five air@@ planes available for rescue operations and further five will be made to transport emergency deliveries to those in their flooded villages .
also various organisations and star@@ tu@@ ps have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on high water supply and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue @-@ life d@@ ron@@ es for their operations require , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate the dry foods and life @-@ necessary goods for high water @-@ offerings -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 42 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 in case you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ ni@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water help &quot; button that authori@@ zes users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up of assistance and donations . these were then passed for free to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .
likewise , they conducted a &quot; SOS @-@ key &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful nav@@ al transactions for floods into the result of floods and lands@@ li@@ des .
the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need of need in need of security and need help of the funds .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long way up to restoring norm@@ ality .
Muslims , which you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
usage : Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and love girlfriend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in her surf .
in one minute we call for par@@ ols for the rights of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next war , we en@@ list rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of rainf@@ all and men , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a towel high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already done this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the far @-@ spread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
you must ti@@ ze me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim , to different art . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim reserve .
this dra@@ wer in our collective imagination is so well designed that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit in there , are un@@ Muslim .
Muslim is becoming inv@@ it@@ alized
I do not stand alone .
this is even done to the poet , whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox mus@@ li@@ ant pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western presentation , religion became er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one consists of the redu@@ ci@@ ble images of Muslims , which have been pre @-@ coloni@@ ze Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid , in the 1970s exposed the story behind these pictures .
but these images continue to rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are continuing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative dominate our news@@ letters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this narrative o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries while the US 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential fund .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are forced to wear their head towel in public buildings and u@@ ci@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , movements for change .
it looks at the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken at the American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought to slavery with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has undergone our collective imagination so deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the destination an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ ous attacks and bat@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we are telling it , Islam@@ ophobia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.@@ 7 billion include
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who will help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the s@@ acc@@ v of the 1.@@ 7 billion .
and we have failed to achieve that where seven million Muslims com@@ prise the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
approved .
four decades ago , my native parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first gem design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was thinking about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were comfor@@ ting Muslims and Americans .
but am I now re@@ assur@@ ing Muslim and American ?
sometimes when I ask people why I don &apos;t like pig @-@ style , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some pocket cor@@ ps that Muslims carry in themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all the pocket cor@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists which are striving to combat widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ set Islam@@ ist refin@@ ery with creditors , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what is a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam is more than just a stranger , who irrit@@ ates a woman &apos;s towel .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so distant , so versatile and multi @-@ fac@@ eted , that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of her children &apos;s gar@@ dener .
approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim , but was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of an Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack on the following concepts : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my muscular faith and behaviour may not always be seen , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surge I see that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and her the Arab verses for the protection of the refugee , who defeated the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one could see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , as she wins a I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
approved .
belonging to my grandmother &apos;s vision , the image of my grandmother was maternal , with her sisters , for decades of competition the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I will conclude in this moment , when I finished my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of the ancient Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and one basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that can be almost maneu@@ ver@@ able .
to be Muslims , to speak the prayers , which she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslims , how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only master .
for a people whom , over the centuries - by an &quot; Empire &quot; , established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved .
belonging means , to grow and listen , that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my grandfather is crying .
middle of bridge , while he writes books on the modern Islam and about the independence of Kash@@ mir , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan f@@ aded over his family in India ruled by Kash@@ mir , family that he could not include in his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , were torn apart from coloni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims in the last two centuries Europeans all have colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly @-@ bomb of history was rejected in a century over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Swedish , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ ordinate of the British Empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go back into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ one story .
it means remembering that twenty years ago the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops that were distributed across every continent , apart from the Antarc@@ tica , have been distributed in Iraq to pursue mass destruction of weapons , which did not exist .
it means knowing that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim , knowing that the su@@ icide @-@ rate of both veter@@ ans has risen more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy seeks out the USA and that susp@@ ects a Muslim name , which is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that four @-@ ten years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it &apos;s the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pakist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , implies the inherent part of our multi @-@ pron@@ ged identities , but to fail they will communicate in others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fol@@ li@@ v of the 1.@@ 7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but it is represented in the reducing bi@@ dding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and to ensure all Muslim children , knowing that to build powerful and privileged people on these branches of structural xen@@ ophobia .
structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim authorities , which began with President Bush and have been extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in a hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries who bombar@@ ded it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims into the cros@@ sha@@ irs .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study conducted by the A@@ scent of Man , scientists presented the North@@ western University of participants a scientifically negative image and b@@ ade them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the con@@ vers@@ ations we need to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep inside to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an@@ ize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging that we have in our news interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to collect our many identities by hy@@ ph@@ oned identities and forget history .
the Pod@@ cast lake something , S@@ ay &apos;s something from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # good@@ Muslim ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the pak@@ ist@@ an@@ isch , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots from media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am worried about this difficult global time , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for conspir@@ ators who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because Muslims have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially , by making the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , she had not given them yet ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am worried about the realities and history of which I was not aware of as I was as old as it is now my daughter , but today I was making a must for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I have left behind in my speech here like a bread@@ cr@@ atic track .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the sections that makes our humanity a story , where someone is being made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations will take place at the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ophobia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why don &apos;t I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and killed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination , four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of how it &apos;s my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because of the occupation that we haven &apos;t spec@@ ulate us a new future , while he already cro@@ pped countries and &quot; to others &quot; men bombar@@ ded that goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ eller , of Flickr @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ wa@@ ist@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages would not be passed on to the children born there .
for the creators of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create towns , diversity - secure spaces , where residents do not have to forget who they are to assign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers form their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation makes it possible that the audiences can be guided through it .
they call laughter and emotions , as if the language no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of narr@@ atives .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having said the meaning of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara was asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened to !
you were alert ...
they were completely with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ting tours .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ establishment of state debt
with the aim of a re @-@ check of public debt from Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participating in April 3 , 2017 various religious and civil organizations participating in a mass rally ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( People &apos;s Front for the Neur@@ ath of debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the Adv@@ oc@@ ate of the debts of debts also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts , are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial test and a control committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be pressed and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be found with lower pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state bundle of integrated territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
that is why the so @-@ called &quot; centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without parti@@ tions , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on government responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside the actions will be imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; danger to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and authors appreciate the work of the ming@@ led Syrian developer &apos;s Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi
Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ oura .
photo from the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian website K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is known for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom , and remind him of the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture , organized in Berlin , devoted an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , manager at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house made by so @-@ called &apos; book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ) .
the book which was published last year and is licensed here license @-@ free , contains a number of papers that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book will discuss how movements for Free knowledge are built and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working side by side to watch over the fog that surrounds our news@@ letters and to create something out of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the A@@ alto &apos;s List in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information whatsoever about its present state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have to let us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we draw ?
what did we give up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bas@@ ket marked the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that they were contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 that placed themselves as an in@@ sider of Assad &apos;s government and acknowledged it by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologi@@ an and at the moment over@@ head the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le cultural prototypes were pres@@ cient as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ra virtu@@ ell .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the way@@ mark of numerous civilizations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that not only embo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has made a time period created for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable importance .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel was not able to complete this project yet .
in addition to the book , N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I have spent my whole life with it , dream of freedom and b@@ ump taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English in , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with each he has asked . he has taught other incar@@ cer@@ ers to read and speak English .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is happening with every visit ,
that in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose the cl@@ ot@@ ting in the moment we embrace .
that each of the dangers no matter .
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and Gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and in every detail of your voice and words ,
which I wear with passion for me ,
if your eyes are not saying
and I let another piece of my soul be with you ...
I will return soon to my lon@@ eliness ,
to resur@@ rec@@ t all the moments
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I finished myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ haz@@ i :

Bas@@ sels Story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or lost under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for release from Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption perpet@@ u@@ ary Director after provisional release back to previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger in a corrupt , where a government member returned to the workplace half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
these are di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants in 2010 .
the money came from public transit of the airports of Mozambique , whose Council got Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately asked for his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company what happened on 19th April .
in accordance with an opinion of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s prosec@@ utor of the Republic , which claimed the application , there would be no obstacles for Cam@@ b@@ aza to refer back to his old posts as the company was not discipl@@ ined after his detention .
yet many of the inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for Public Health ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to put the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clearly indicated the lack of transparency and is even a step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that even the company should lead a lack of discipline against the res@@ tra@@ geous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the firm seems to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and prompted no appropriate legal steps to use the respective functions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considers the case to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ ors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and which half of them went .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and record his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has granted himself to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
to be contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of Political Science in Brazil says the director no morality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can not believe that someone was rewarded with such a way that the state has already so massive offen@@ ded .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is lacking mor@@ als and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead she has only served on the state itself .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ ler it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible bill of money and the state itself became we@@ ary of this man who was pre@@ charged and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded with such a reward .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te fav@@ ored it , the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
Die@@ be belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mos@@ ambique will not only remain in memory for ever as a first independent president , but also as a shar@@ per , cutting edge and by side - prophe@@ tic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he dict@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious man was capable of everything , even the father@@ land for his ambitions , its own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not change his ambitions .
a ambitious man is a criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ continued :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and came free .
and today it sets up the firm in which he tre@@ ad money again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î´@@ Î¹@@ Îº@@ Ï ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or trace . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people east @-@ Indian origin or generally use as an ad@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ firm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or of an initiative , as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ lution con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word in itself does not automatically collect hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts in order to be expressed in the purpose of his use .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with the different mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( column ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ess A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , if they knew how he could soo@@ the his back pain by playing a word game .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the frac@@ ture ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ dens is the opinion that she is likely to reduce her speech of radical nationalist , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it ign@@ ites all of the post@@ ings that appear in suspicion to spread racism .
Facebook extingu@@ ishes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm is not understood what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the side words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( column ) .
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to be circumc@@ ised by its nationalism .
while the action may transmit a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy doesn &apos;t seem to last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Fem@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords are often a cat@@ tery and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply to begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung my@@ ard described how Facebook began to clear his post@@ ings , when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and sent to me the light , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because of the post &quot; the Facebook community &quot; was not dis@@ missed . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of examples removed from people who have no negative purposes or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country have been bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine thinks that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice issues :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems that without a local context or technical support and as words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ an@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even as they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t tried to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts that have been deleted .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they have a great deal of revenue , this would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided a lot of der@@ ision under users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook and consciously feel the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their post@@ ings are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who contained no hate speech , but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bur@@ ial text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see an inheritance of an Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post office which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , which have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , has increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks will add violence to the churches in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate speech to bring on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on the context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s toe is in Trinidad and Tobago for now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that is to ban this practice so that the homeless age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ tery some members kept li@@ ger@@ istic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group that representatives of various religious groups of the country did not interfere with the state , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was done regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is an affiliate of the UN Women &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children which was married to 15 were married , Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 , it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical form of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were endeav@@ ouring to lay laws on the kinder@@ garten , followed on the footh@@ ills and also grati@@ fying great support . without doubt they helped to bring about this outcome .
however , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu @-@ leader , for example , had no concern to say the critics of children , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made for tensions in this actually unusual thing , and at some point out of doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft law .
but at the beginning of 2017 the draft bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now the president of the country has to agree and to proc@@ laim the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the Land given a status update on Facebook that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one on the other .
after having been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on kinder@@ garten were finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who clo@@ th@@ ed a ministry in the education of education :
it has too much time and unnecessary barriers needed to wear the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the marriage @-@ marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago for now , and that is worth every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , stating : , , Excellent news !
the adul@@ ter@@ law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which list@@ ens to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the homeless age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the confes@@ sions of 18 years .
the draft for the change of the adul@@ tery was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were committed to the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Children &apos;s ehe accomplished in Trinidad and Tobago for this reason .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ birth @-@ ild@@ ing .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ at Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best known Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj proclaimed his intention of taking court steps should be passed the law and he seems to redeem his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the General @-@ General Adv@@ oc@@ ate General Al ra@@ wi , a prop@@ on@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legi@@ tim@@ ately , if Mahar@@ aj would act against the law , most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that only talk about panic and discomfort , if we &apos;re talking to the state , our daughters guard safegu@@ ards that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men who are compared to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the inf@@ anti@@ le is legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws which they say .

the mir@@ rors of web sites can view Turkish users again from Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , opposite to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally presented .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been drag@@ ging the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia .
day after day will be more significant , how important the platform for users is to find and share information helpful and reliable information .
both students and fans of TV @-@ series rep@@ el against the block .
although many more techn@@ ologically advanced Internet users are used to use byp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article by the New York Times ) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey was subject to article by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second @-@ known country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary U@@ ses File System ) , as the platform initi@@ ates all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available despite legal prohibition however .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after we listened to the news ( on the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents at de@@ centralized and distributed .
this can help users to view all of the Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely addressed to screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has created both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ pedia , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ sites when the country is suspended in Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of one proxy @-@ address , a mirror .
you have access to a different URL , which is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia side , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ alese wildlife photographer uses his camera to raise awareness of the need for nature conservation
a nice rhin@@ ocer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with bad motives and washed colors .
the motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera with him and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar makes every effort to bring an international stage to the international stage .
and his hometown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which direct the attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I had just returned home , when suddenly he called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a leop@@ ard was .
river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I was running with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was lying and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to attain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already standing on face to face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep .
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the book appeared . he immediately sets right away , and he star@@ ving me through the Sal trees ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the advancement of Nep@@ alese and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited 22 days long , and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he took a tiger photographed and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .

this contribution was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kol@@ an@@ wal@@ a and appeared originally on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was once again released as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women are committed to speaking with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure as well as fear of the consequences , they should understand the norm .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a , by a s@@ lu@@ ent , judged by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with name .
the tradition also not name their wives to name , is also common among men . however , they have far less acc@@ re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear if at all , they should not be re@@ directed to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the Pun@@ e district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became one of the main debates about the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , is part of the # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ p has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ struc@@ ted , and runs these clubs .
it tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they also have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in its discussion showed , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this issue because she would open a conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can identify easily .
saying not to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a bread which holds it all du@@ ti@@ du@@ ously maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman that does not dwell alone is seen as a reflection , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is rooted as deeply that we have never thought of it up to this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband in the name , try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion about her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini talks :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband d@@ ashed for a long time after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on at his name .
with this confidence in the luggage Pro@@ ini started its first discussion group .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked anyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women married the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini talks :
a woman was so shy that she was just wondering during the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole an@@ ed frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ renalin rush of having broken with an age @-@ old bread , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands .
and they kept their word .
over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she came down , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participating in was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ra@@ ged in violence .
Roh@@ ini said how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ded red spot on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the galvan@@ ic point if he was doing it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to wear it .
the other women did not stop completely , but they think they are in a better position , even to choose him not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion group is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any discussion group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack our lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who what could be heard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and nevertheless I have made some things , such as our identities on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to our clothes .
some women in the group have supported only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of that is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad spa , a vast shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of arguments and discussion of the advantages of his own clothes , morality joined with the Sar@@ is and much more , mug@@ glers &apos; its own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
on the question , whether in the five months following the first discussion of the discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming to its roles :
we have only taken small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their hus@@ bands .
some , including myself , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two shall say the name of their hus@@ bands . now one or two women are now carrying on their forehead .
the women in the discussion group should know that the changes they want to achieve within their lives - like the ha@@ ste of more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reported to other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of ab@@ duction of glorious persons for the organ , probably for all @-@ believing purposes , troubled the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . now the local government called for a number of operations to stop the practitioner .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border with Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently brought them that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are exploited .
there shall be the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glorious man of gold could bring gold or wealth , the police declared of the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered on the un@@ cles men in Mozambique .
another group , which is the target of ob@@ scure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 entered a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Mozambique senior men in Mozambique are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambique police according to the latest lo@@ wer@@ ies due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the read@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ ats Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ans in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already im@@ itate the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the children of men .
the persecution and assassination of heavy individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ a@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has taken into consideration the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that believing in the head would have power , the riches had generated .
in the last days three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ antha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , that clari@@ fies that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique is opposite :
I would like to be ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to go on the streets , and who would not hurt women or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ it@@ ful for aber@@ ches or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to get schn@@ au@@ tious wealth .

a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in achieving public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arab blog@@ gers .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i reported it was contacted by persons who became himself as an in@@ sider of Assad &apos;s government spending .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
basic stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ oura of Syrian officers came out that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we prove to be the honour of Bas@@ sel as a pioneer of the open Web @-@ movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have used their release over the past five years .
since 2011 and the commen@@ cement of the protest against Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those who have been arrested by the regime or disappeared by viol@@ ently , are torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians had come to death in custody , thus the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a picture of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably has recently been made recently .
this story was originally released on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the de@@ tained Chinese dis@@ sertation Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ it@@ alized in the hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( public debt ) after he had filed a manifes@@ to on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which had filed the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China said Li@@ us Fall as an &quot; internal matter , &quot; and said a spokes@@ man , He used it as &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to call for calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , and allow him to make a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wiped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reaction from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad for treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ inging refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government is ur@@ ging that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until the end of December last year . only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon until China , since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
once the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously fallen ill , the Nobel Committee brought up his hope for a unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of its de@@ port he was unable to viol@@ ate its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us , also called for the release of Li@@ us on the occasion of a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to impose all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to freely communicate with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ de shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it may help him during his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an speaker at the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27th , announ@@ cing that the message from the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the call for the US Embassy drew an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Polish shared with that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , such as the freedom of travel at liberty and access to medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to accordance with Chinese Constitution and legal systems , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government on it to release Li@@ u and his wife unconditional release .
I call on China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can move into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on the G20 and 8th July at the G20 , Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the Re@@ uters agency that China had great concern if the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um made available to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , told him every day , but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
McC@@ all@@ um tells further :
Canada demands China to protect its international humanitarian obligations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old freedom and exercise for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department ordered China in an explanation on June 29 on , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .
although the news sender France info has already reported that the French government would be welcomed to Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually take him up .
Taiwan
the Council of fes@@ tivities in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who are campa@@ igning for peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party ( EPP ) called for China also on the sick of the intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u , and gave many people asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he accepted and for whom he was strictly punished , to a harmon@@ ise , more stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent to China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be stupid as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mug@@ am should look at Singapore as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting during a meeting of the International Bic@@ ist Association of the State of New York , the Minister expressed that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because in Singapore they are compared with other countries .
he supports Singapore that Singapore should be considered .
no one has questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ erio acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight before the kill@@ ings , an obligation .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons given by Shan@@ mug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in the face of its , it inevitably appeared non @-@ democratic .
in contrast , it def@@ ends the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities who are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratically .
once one reaches the core point of the subject again the good old grief of the authorit@@ arian rulers appear to be pret@@ tier , leaving the tw@@ isted logic as it fits better to their power .
at the end of the last week of Shan@@ mug@@ am there were answers to its American guests regarding our press , our judiciary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he called for appropriate questions with non @-@ responses to rational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mug@@ am to clear his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country is part of our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our valued K Shan@@ mug@@ gle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would take the trouble to clear this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the city government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire con@@ nex@@ ion of the conference , in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mug@@ glers in the better way , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the story .
as he said , Singapore was more of a &quot; city , &quot; said , why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he led Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously doesn &apos;t meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mug@@ am , who is the leader of a growing generation , such as pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very confused ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that expects me - whether I disagree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes it , is correctly associated and aware of what it def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review zer@@ sets the weaknesses of Shan@@ mug@@ ams Arg@@ umenten :
&quot; &quot; &quot; does Mr. Shan@@ mug@@ gler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country does the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government office , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mug@@ am are of more serious importance .
why do the jun@@ gles work in their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the people of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many of the paintings ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world being revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices , Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is most put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and returned to Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fications then most often the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook war@@ dly in front of anger when they are held for Americans , but me does not bother .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag to be visible in their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadian .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was , when I started travelling 20 years ago , to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried tiny map@@ le sheets at their luggage in order to differentiate themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same @-@ sex marriage in Canada have been legal in Canada ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I appreciated very much .
it would mean nothing if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the p@@ unch &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be described , is basically to be intri@@ gue - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ substantial figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has a own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
harmless to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and do not deserve attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things around you happen .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a leading piece of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &apos; nice &apos; , is maybe simply just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with neighbours .
we lacks the warm , open kindness that I have meanwhile connecting with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au stepped on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video that took over the Jun@@ ta , which took over the power of 2014 and restore the civilian government despite their hearing , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells us what authority he makes his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the Music video relates indirectly to the continued military power of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
in the first three days this was divided into Facebook with up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin Video &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand following a group of activists asking the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
check out these shots of the video that focuses on some of the policy issues that Thailand have tr@@ acked in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the wir@@ ing section 44 of the provisional state , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute right decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; imagination &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded as critics by the Jun@@ ta .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often exploited by the authorities in order to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit of the army was established , the online content is monitored and persons with which the monarchy would be sl@@ ander@@ ed to have criminal prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a stri@@ pe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ella &quot; ( Maj@@ ority offensive ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was declared war law .
two days later , there came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision expensive U @-@ boats to buy , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video even shows how individuals are thrown into a black supplier , before putting them into an interfer@@ ing camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by stra@@ ying , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by coup @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Asia .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is reco@@ vering very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , above all in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian war was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chi@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ Pacific basin .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ down , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russian and exhaust @-@ har@@ es live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ ums .
during the pre @-@ war era more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people had risen after over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty 5 @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sh@@ t@@ bo@@ kow@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are van@@ ished and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it hur@@ ts him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens , gra@@ dient all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ lung splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like .
K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s kas that are still one or two families , you can recognize at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girlfriend to a little and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence economy ( cultivation of land products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get on the rounds .
the district government provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya worked as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jun@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not abandoned before Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in down@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial support from her daughter and insist that her instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly instal@@ ents are currently nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya &apos;s telling you that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do so - everyone is concerned with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; called T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; you said , we could connect to zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as Mak@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia break simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( ste@@ ward @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillar in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take a little &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains it again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha received approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
your man works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chickens .
it tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation than many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day that the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation lies at the end , a little boy ap@@ points to us over .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased him behind .
he plays with the ball that rolling up the hill .
a group of children is now looking for the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the remaining buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on its long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acking was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
cross the road of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mexic@@ ans , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink fe@@ ather @-@ gest@@ ell and gold @-@ colored ear @-@ rings in Te@@ ddy bear @-@ bears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Haiti that are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with high numbers , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post about the hotel - but still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people are told in full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some of them have already slept on cardboard .
she does not want to refuse any one .
they also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that made from the long journey exhausted .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again .
they have lived in Brazil for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a normal stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard of other way@@ far@@ ers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that , Afri@@ cans had already speaking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
how many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a builder for construction of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch forever . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez nar@@ rated that their guests often send their messages , if they have gone to gr@@ ats or to report about the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , perhaps very well @-@ known , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants that are travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter the Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family are taken in their little house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are here , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ aner .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are performing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have seen what they experience .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived three years , he was reported in a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled with his wife and three children before men who wanted to press money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a well @-@ known , a single out , has offered him its roof .
some months later the family lives forever and they try to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in courses , travelers are quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ g@@ ically because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother , she fed her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter &apos;s daughter with African hair@@ s who made her a lady , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs when she is presenting her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated her every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , to the far / or
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile user in Tian@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi was a cell phone call , in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , the app is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , the authorities would also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because it was shortly after they had replaced the app , which had exchanged messages with a private We@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the press release , the app recognizes the sources and the distribution routes of terrorists and follow , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective services with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphy websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and manage their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while we focus on digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet isolation .
based on Twitter @-@ based media outlets from mainland China , &quot; hosted the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , where poli@@ cem@@ an un@@ ra@@ zed the residents op@@ tionally as a result , whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile alert notification calls for people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be incar@@ cer@@ ated up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back on technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances needed for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the world .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( or on the previous part ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password &apos;s claim for a Windows operating system , and with it full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are stored in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on electronic manual .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are potentially a response to the instructions of the city of party , to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the data security office instructions in operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all the residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st of August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million , and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible merits , including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything crying out to death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has written his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ st that you are totally alone at a place where all is magnificent .
everything has gradually dis@@ band@@ ed and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one who makes all honour of its name .
one who has beaten down in a list of sentim@@ ents and expres@@ siveness that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality is recovered and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into being out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death .
all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you will become aware of your existence even though the Earth is rotating on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ l . you realize that you are trapped in the walls of the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough , so that I learned &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security services it form@@ u@@ ated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he posed his power over us by proving even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were swe@@ pt away during a peaceful protest like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it ran@@ ged from so that the city was disman@@ tled the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighborhood used to be cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was still , reg@@ aining , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is gest@@ ating to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the district stopped .
I passed the silence , by speaking several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house @-@ roof .
I heard my voice un@@ hur@@ ting through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were joining up to a magnificent picture that met my expectations completely and totally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are friendly the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the sense of smell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return your voice after you picked you all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ on@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an was standing there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s also hear me how you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not in the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ts eyes were afraid of me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t believe yourself what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old ; it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so certain of my job as I said , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that had such fatal consequences for me , and yet I didn &apos;t regret a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in sol@@ itary and his father the same with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is identical to that . &quot;
the pl@@ ank of this tw@@ isted proposition lies me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , a psych@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to months .
I shou@@ ting the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then goes back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I pre@@ ach all the details exactly before I care the room .
different from otherwise they probably share a larger cell .
I have to share it with just one other prisoner and may immediately sit down without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I grab@@ bed her off a fast @-@ established communication method : to beat your fist against the wall .
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ ic was a &quot; first @-@ purpose . &quot;
after a long hesitation he rep@@ lied to me ultimately .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , a respected man of middle age lay similar to me and referred to as &quot; the doctor . &quot;
there are no mark@@ ers in complete darkness in the perfect darkness and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers are fond of its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would fre@@ ak him when I abide .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ban@@ ish all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ el themselves at the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at that time the cry , every day .
the door opens up .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light which presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ gle on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to be heard . &quot;
that was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security before us and prevent that we press the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ board and prov@@ oked the close eye @-@ eye view of their world view .
this is not a house , which is here no country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminals of her clan .
I cared for the inter@@ c@@ eption and tre@@ adm@@ its to Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
he cap@@ tures a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the face @-@ expressions , that he der@@ ailed : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much more important with your life than to protest this day and protest against demonstrations that will soon find an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to answer it , not to answer .
I can truly not say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I would probably have had to get used to it , punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the affection@@ ate &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube that probably originates from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er acc@@ uses to your writer .
give it the pleasure ; you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cri@@ es fell yet not enough , which is why they re@@ inter@@ ed the tube by a cable .
during my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than garbage bags or if it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to us to present themselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour I altern@@ ated three of them while I was still in the row .
I had lost all my feelings in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no favour at all , which is why he rec@@ al@@ ted next to an electric shock .
electricity sh@@ out my whole body , enough to supply my entire area .
my semi @-@ baked body , which lay down on the ground was the perfect black@@ smith .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been at midnight .
I decided to lay down again , let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left , that occurred to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the light fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of an exhaustive young . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my master , my father has to worry about fear@@ lessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and gone away you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an ap@@ pers Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in its studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the majority of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he stro@@ ve to his canvas , sometimes his computer , and then also to his couch .
but on which one can rely , is a cigarette between its fingers or its with nicotine to discover lips .
he lives at the top of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced their families to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ he@@ dra ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and scrut@@ ini@@ ze their well @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his music , often faced with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ativity , but also in towns that are wealthy from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited in his mind by borders , and he can sympath@@ ise according to his own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he is sending a particular dis@@ incl@@ ination to the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b don &apos;t believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian fe@@ iting of the second generation &quot; - so he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and never been in Palestine before .
&quot; I do not think of my personal circumstances , &quot; empha@@ sizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think that because I am a man , &quot; while he pra@@ ising a man in water as a cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims from dawn to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ ant law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a dominating hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lo@@ op@@ ies speak of the warm coffee and the wa@@ ist@@ les of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if one throws a view into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramad@@ an to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians to support the Islamic State &apos;s Front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ woman Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert will be .
the MP and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had just been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer .
many also affir@@ m that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old proven legitimacy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la said the j@@ ord@@ ant people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive support of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continue to be decided &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is likely to not simply be the rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflect that seems clear in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards to cor@@ ps by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently broken man , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the last few years in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ our &apos; Hon@@ our &apos; has increased to the un@@ official outside world .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Citi@@ zen reached its climax in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried to support the victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law of breaking @-@ breaking violence from 1954 , women can be de@@ tained at in@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family needed that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for those not to shy away from themes which have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes that his work is political , and is , however , that he is his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was driven to politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs , which are in the core politically , can be further developed .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what one wants &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ geneous or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that there is hardly someone in Jordan on the rights of g@@ ays and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality by LG@@ BT@@ Q + -@@ individuals were heavily cens@@ ored until in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b concluded an interview for the popular Jama@@ ican news program Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were swe@@ pt away from the context , and had been cens@@ ored to his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without c@@ utt@@ ings@@ - but only a working version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b buys open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poem .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , was supposed to write in the eighth century openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier that not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ial kingdom it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of speech and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ ant news service took several former government members and members of the teacher association , with the reason they had expressed critically on their comments in social media and expressed deep problems with the corruption that deeply rooted in the country .
given this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is not only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river .
for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has for@@ bid for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks slow , depres@@ sing and in@@ war@@ dly changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dream , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions of foreign countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming not only of his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , inter@@ dependence and artificial type , led democracies . at least he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will pass over and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ers are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one pres@@ umes that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually ha@@ iled in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory implies that the celebration , the dr@@ um@@ mers and the tan@@ ces were over a thousand years , and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan to the north @-@ mar@@ ched to force the indigenous residents of the region , the E@@ mi@@ hi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we got a super view .
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint Centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have long been looking back to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two celebrations are to be seen .
but for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival to spend the only true way in this summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high rock was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely were external appearances and body@@ care as important as in this story , because they help to keep away the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s major port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road@@ blocks and illegal drugs are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to having more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the most extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , even has inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts together to show who can create from them the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the next video ( see further videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who find themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people , exchange their weapons against air@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice providing training in hair style , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered by dozens of young people have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school presented special educational workshops prior to the school year &apos;s school year and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love &apos;s love for guer@@ illa
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the following version of the paper &quot; love of love in guer@@ illa , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who do not feel fati@@ g@@ ged with affection ?
this question was precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation to become the campaign C@@ art@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , and the young people en@@ gen@@ dered to write guer@@ illa by letters .
only recently was her country venue of a historic events and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiation , the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colombian ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace agreement was so important that the Colum@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits .
but it is still a long way to the colum@@ b@@ ors until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ llas , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried around the clock in their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colombian society again , which had become accustomed to life in fear and in some cases . hate against guer@@ illa , must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ kers coinci@@ ded together and would have to help with the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ illa , to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ illa , which should then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters for reconciliation arose in the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi in 2014 , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
this explained that we love the people we love to write by thousands of love &apos;s letters by Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more necessary .
he plane , he told it , this year he told his love to share with people who were expecting the most urgent support .
thus , the plan created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now to find their place in society and become a new life . &quot; these letters will show that the Colum@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace . &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities , like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and BogotÃ¡ .
&apos;@@ i had never thought that someone would forgive me . &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on March 19 in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists in the camp to transfer letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were focused on how they had done it before , to follow the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands but letters of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the policy scientist Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a collabor@@ ator of the govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience so :
after we had handed down the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ illa @-@ fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net designer , a deadly weapon in the thorn sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said he said to him and asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answered . &quot; and suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I embr@@ aced it quite firmly and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
maybe he was sorry , he was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its with open arms for us .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
as a result , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a panel discussion together .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
therefore the leaders of F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice from the state to develop on the whole Colombian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this scale it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
these people heard that had never been heard before and had no election right , and to realize that people that I often had seen as monsters and even hate too , even people with beautiful feelings , which were revers@@ ed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who killed and have killed so much damage , can teach us a little and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ anism was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all def@@ ender of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to it - to rise above all that dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , contribute to our contributions and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will come up many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this follows the translation of an article that was dra@@ fted by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and published its initial publication on the OC Media website .
homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ c@@ asian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical , sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months about the persecution of swe@@ ar men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ s@@ worth above the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , is not only created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ vers@@ al woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and spoken with us about what happens today in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has captured the international headlines several months ago , after reports published , covering torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of the world .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ er men , and they were in secret prisons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they had grown up , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which was why they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens had experienced the gender equality of their land , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
and out of fear for their lives they stepped into the US in the end .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife that stuck in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hesitation .
while I tried to help her , he made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he ex@@ cre@@ pt them to his che@@ et@@ hen@@ ish friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made the lap of the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just about creating a few bas@@ kets from my car &apos;s home , I heard a man &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I feel something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long are you going to dish@@ ing the family , you s@@ well ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again at the end .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I assumed that I f@@ aded two f@@ f@@ aded in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which hospitals are you put into place - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are de@@ prec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with the fear of doing it ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ dal name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , alien , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that this was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by being above without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people once spoke my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole of the Republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a stri@@ ker around the neck .
luckily the neighbors got and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and only a few hours later it was a car with dark wind@@ ow@@ ded windows and a numer@@ ical plate with a 95 mood .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was nothing lazy .
my human right @-@ brothers @-@ friends overlooked the numer@@ ical depic@@ tions - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you have fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to disclose their name , but I will say I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something in@@ belie@@ vable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought myself a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without having to register without a statement , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe about , you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are st@@ agi@@ ous . you even know your number number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about sex . however , we do not talk about sex .
some traditionally cau@@ c@@ asian elements I still wear in me .
so much I wish , these spiritual barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera I actually give me trouble how the person should look at that it reminds themselves from her past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed here ?
Sabrina : I made a report in Washington last week .
for the later , I needed current information on the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has included one and a half months in the gun .
he told that during Ramad@@ an there was no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait to wait and he didn &apos;t shut up a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
so that I , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are currently still vibr@@ ating men stuck in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine said , there would not be very many .
if , then in particular those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives were dropped to place themselves Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be converted , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base .
understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but rather sub@@ merged to eradic@@ ate oneself .
OC Media : is it just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , having grown beard .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they just took them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was personally involved when these people were taken .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports yet . we suspect such actions are quite possible .
why else could you not allow these people to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who hear a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , already taking place in the past ?
Sabrina : I always contributed my hair for a long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already in 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than it is now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were cor@@ ted ; I had colored lashes , carried the tube je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the safety of security of sh@@ aria has never sli@@ pped to me just a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people who met me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte is not the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children , if they make yourself funny about sick .
OC Media : so you just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did these Gn@@ at times held ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister 2005 , he started talking about morality .
he did not speak about us by se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like the people in town started to change .
he who had previously sal@@ uted and borrowed , look at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could sense how the situation in the Republic has ever disappeared .
OC Media : which activity will you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I mean not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the United States .
I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise teac@@ up information , I guide them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
for a long time I have no p@@ enny .
I discovered these people myself when I cla@@ de the hiding place .
I am Muslims and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : contribute to Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is silly .
in this way nature is pure and nothing has to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who do not want to prophes@@ y you with foam prior to the mouth , that there are no g@@ ays by them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ines have which , the Russians have , and on all the planets there are - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mosque and during Ramad@@ an - live together with men .
do you know many think about transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a Tru@@ g@@ lock .
these are two different things - two different ways of sensation , in order to be exact , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to stay here as personal , but my last intimate relationship is now over a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I simply know I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ murder within the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the last months there has been a sharp rise in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the A@@ war@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video inter@@ cep@@ ted on YouTube gave the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide who has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists standing on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ i and Sha@@ wn Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hanging .
their stories have one thing in common : these were all family pat@@ ernal people who felt , because of persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable of protecting their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of Iran live in Iran live in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago the arab@@ ic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ i monarchy prevailed , and in 1925 , under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most distinguished and valuable utility for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the local people only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated disease , hunger and hard@@ ships .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Irish @-@ Nazi @-@ Arabs systematically with jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also has a variety of dam@@ s built , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi @-@ juven@@ iles now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ torate @-@ General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , finished elementary school , 55 % finished a secondary school and 45 % have a diploma .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Ken@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high increase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ mad @-@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Fun@@ c@@ tion@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers the Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will de@@ file access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to make a living outside of their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their superi@@ ors and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and become so grace@@ ful as the Arab name in the workplace will not be tolerated , because the speaking of Arabic language , or the wearing of Arabic clothes .
given the given circumstances which the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional
details of a photo . recorded by : pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the C@@ C@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have expressed .
you can read the comments under the original text in the comments below .
if I say I am not a voc@@ alist , many women react and especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well thought , scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ istic and why we generally have all femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , that in spite of the same formation , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across to a smooth ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and discrimination on the basis of sex can still be drawn across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I ble@@ de twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak of skin colour , on racism , on black strip @-@ women , on black women in the LG@@ BT@@ IQ @-@ community or on black women in the LG@@ BT@@ IQ @-@ community or black women , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to mention feminine femin@@ ists .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to lift their voices and to &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , &quot; my lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of an institution@@ alised form , which we are black women exposed to two different ways .
or in addition , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and cities of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl from school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as a white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men je@@ d@@ no skin colour of the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect to a movement as a black woman whose center is the white woman who refuse to take care of inj@@ us@@ tices in her mind , which refers both to the gender and to the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight my belonging in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere , which repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology , in which black woman is a purely human and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me divisions , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to reveal white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to be the meaning of black women for feminist movement tot@@ ality , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them from the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to place women of different incomes and boundaries of white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to start releasing the movement of femin@@ ism and forced me to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so ins@@ istent that interfer@@ ing is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move forward into the spheres , which will be created for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana T@@ om@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by ourselves , in which they are completely safe and can be re@@ vered in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical , and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are calling immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a blur@@ ry environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I existed .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and on account of my existence as a part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
pad@@ laying against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published once again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a visited over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan Regional Government . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a holds the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women presents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cou@@ rier . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ mu@@ jer ( # refuse entry ) , reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its ex@@ partner who has become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship was some time gone and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out because of distr@@ acts , including the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez only .
a few days later the second woman drew her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women do not even refund , they do not generally receive any support from the state .
in many cases the women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , to be victims of violence , to act at all in the law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ ation 1 hits and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible abuse and a legal system that is nothing sub @-@ mm@@ ed 3 Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , scientist for gender issues at the Centro de Doc@@ ument@@ aciÃ³n , E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are different indications and reports but not even approaches to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the available figures are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 the municipal public prosec@@ utor was 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . at 70 % of this , it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads arrived in the police .
there have been more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts . here , 86 % of the ads come here .
in the adver@@ ts 40 % of women said they have been bodily , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to data from the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women &apos;s Secretary in Ana Bai@@ ardi are actually shown only few of these crimes . &quot; on every woman who acts in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse will come 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman , which is non @-@ refundable because of physical mis@@ deeds , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Frauen@@ icide is not a separate criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists have participated at least 12 cases of women &apos;s inf@@ anti@@ cide in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mis@@ actions and a legal system that is doing nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name from all her former friends .
at first she didn &apos;t want it , but then after . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore mental violence against women , one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most serious recognizable .
I have never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are happening that are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen by Carlos for so long and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain role to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , which was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner is miserable .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse all in some way .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
their wealthy partner finally managed to convince them that they were worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ en@@ force@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was primarily about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees also major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ee@@ able to explain and harder to explain and harder to pun@@ ish how it is in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the law@@ ed text was changed in a number of points to also p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay in principle and be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was envis@@ aged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which must at present the victims of violence currently even if they just want to report and obtain a secure accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if there is no sufficient financial means to make it available to them :
in Paraguay is seen as part of human relationships .
a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as something Nor@@ mal .

on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed on the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . before , parts of the law had been modified , but among other things , a passage that had been cancelled in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the stri@@ ction of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great return .

independent media in Oman released a year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues to be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked up by a review of the bure@@ au of information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read Az@@ am@@ n on the home page of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the Peruvian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage about corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he was a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later came free .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn M@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after spending his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state I had set off .
since then he has dressed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Ober@@ ster commander , Secretary of Defence , Finance Minister , Secretary of Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the pers@@ ists of security forces , especially of domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including freedom of press , including freedom of press , blog@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and incar@@ nate .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closing and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; in the judiciary on 26 July 2016 . it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused , judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise an opinion in an inheritance donation .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of the Board of Directors , was charged from the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS gave the vice @-@ chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who following Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is commemor@@ ations as chief editor .
the paper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the information minister prompted the directive to publish the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison quarters and also arranged the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned for a distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; misuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of a violation of a public ban and s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anic reefs ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a one @-@ year career offered to both journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a penalty in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;

the Appe@@ als Court appeals to Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dis@@ missed on 10 April 2017 by his sentence of his six @-@ month jail sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to prison in prison , where he was killed by his years of prison .
the Appe@@ als Court also emphasized the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n gives access to the newspaper still exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on January 8 , the Information Minister granted a statement by which the closing of &apos; Az@@ am@@ n &apos; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister has personally signed a further directive in which the closure of &apos; Az@@ am@@ n &apos; was extended by three additional months and what the Minister agreed upon the decision of the appeal to permit the publication of the newspaper once more .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists from the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman has been injured during the press .
for example , further injury include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , to stop their operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not prepared to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) requests the Colombian authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can walk their work ;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure is processed with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . this is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious impacts than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists by building own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Information at the Centre for research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he searched for HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier R@@ W : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I have recently developed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ ogens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only apply solutions which have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is they adequate ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are also handled differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not conform to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
Q : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is need for special scientific education , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the universe , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able illness ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often , there are the limited speed to do things , and the complicated access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that tries to make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental issues around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton started selling in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous Lic@@ ensing , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
Mor@@ tons became known only through its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ ads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more Sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone , or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert food safety have become the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition Mor@@ ton always served salad , he now needs longer since his work is more and more difficult than ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as it would lie in a river a rocky cliff , in order to p@@ add@@ les I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that this patents on sal@@ ads go far away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they with@@ stand the court , no one can breed any new sal@@ ut@@ ches , because all the features are already patented , &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to make out those characteristics which he wants .
however , it is very careful and makes every effort to use no material which is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Sp@@ ect@@ station ISS have inherited red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ cen@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous Lic@@ ence in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gens are not being protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders .
within the framework of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , US breeders can agree that others can use the seeds to use them freely .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others who buy seeds to breed , and it will not immediately be e@@ dic@@ ated - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ernity or be prescribed .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined forces in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
for the em@@ eri@@ ated Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and for the environment .
seeds are said to play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try the latter not to use only little by raising seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified crops .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ es , genetically modified or not , are announced to the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global ag@@ ri industry , whose recent examples are being announced on farms in China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto , who are being offered in farmers in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way that vegetables are bred , is threatened .
nutritional Gu@@ ests without seeds &quot; sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit to ensuring that their seeds will continue to be available to others . thus , their approach to pat@@ rol the seeds of seeds and plant @-@ characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because of the available gene pool because of the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which therefore is always more limited , inc@@ ess@@ antly shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Os@@ si , has been employed in their doc@@ torate with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ els are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant breeders either at all or only difficult .
there is still no such estimates for other plants but experts like Lu@@ by suspected that plants like wheat are patented in a larger scale than a salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their tastes or colour improves up to such reasons , due to which it thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties prove that the available plant material for breeders by ever more patents decreases . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an E @-@ Mail , Monsanto and C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for mon@@ san@@ ie &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ ces and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining the genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intellectual property belonging to other breeders , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ diets innovations promote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken as soon as the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these commands help others to come with another method on the same outcome .
such protection does not impe@@ de innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees that differently : 20 years to wait for a patent process , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
however , the main argument argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are un@@ attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier .
that is what drives us and it becomes impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
altogether , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es in the concept to pat@@ rol the plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants make themselves up themselves and as breeders we ultimately no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , plant see@@ ker in the US @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is growing a variety , also raising its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ey@@ ries , are needed for their cultivation of mass@@ aging her@@ b@@ ici@@ des ; they grow in the varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly gent@@ l@@ ent . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are patents , manage the most smaller seeds , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they don &apos;t keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton also thinks that breeders would be innovative by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I was with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are pat@@ rol .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know my competitors my varieties are selling for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , and in my opinion it is very pretty easy . &quot;
although the US appears to be leading in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program works with farmers together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to get on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works at an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for the breeding are different from country to country , due to the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it talks against the present practice of the European Patent Office , which is permitted for patents on conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all East Africa joined forces to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and a worldwide trend for seeds of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , explains for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the organization is currently preparing a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report . in that , it represents that farmers have the opportunity to go on seeds , to exchange and improve their seed policy so that a stable supply can be ensured with foods .
the report also emphasises the importance of diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by Lu@@ by from Os@@ si hopes to see it soon more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly ensured , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ aug@@ ust , the Egyptian government clicked the web site of the World Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported to us .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply critici@@ zed and promised the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Network for Human Rights Information remain p@@ ale in spite of this attack and the constitution by the authorities , to conce@@ aled the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , so it was never so important to overcome these goals and not to give up . we insist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and the origin@@ ating network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights research Team Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada does not have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ em@@ used his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write to in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up , was to byp@@ ass the cens@@ ored apparatus of Egypt &apos;s government , even goal of an attack .
blog@@ gers , the supplier in which also is home to the Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security guards as he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook @-@ comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the international blogs to block is very old , however , has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ae al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block of blogs may not become significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is successful to give me a sense of sie@@ ge , a trial , a trial , a fra@@ grant murder , un@@ loading of the National Security Council , the blocking blog as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I &apos;d like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ rough and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) cur@@ led Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this made technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , amongst others Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block of vendors , through re@@ distribution of inter@@ net@@ ting and private browsing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer .
such practices refers to the intention of blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users could have access to .
the situation will additionally be worse , that the cens@@ ors will be made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed from court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day , newspapers are reported in the whole of Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post cards .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; Je@@ th@@ ah his second day is murdered by police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be smo@@ ked dru@@ g@@ store with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence of 2017 in Rio achieved the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian government of Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus released the detailed report on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , from the civili@@ zed standard devi@@ ates and what happens only in Rio , is in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war@@ ring in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
we know that a war@@ time of war if it is distorted , too can be used to viol@@ ate atrocities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra in contrast to describe the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account the person responsible in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with sufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ agre@@ eable neglect of the public service .
to remember : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violent @-@ violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the murder rates per state , Rio to No. 16 , &quot; she writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the biggest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the state security policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on these security policy measures the establishment of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state established in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by the use of a massive police sp@@ ots and to stop a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this was in fact lead to a decrease of tremendous deaths . for some years now , the U@@ PP , however , after several reports on r@@ amps and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor con@@ gregations , which should actually protect the newly created police force .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux received from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war increases serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to use ways and ways that are typical of a war . for this , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lateral damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ tless balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war now or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police took the mountain with Fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
among all these violence also this incident made headlines : a fruit @-@ seller died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ ber@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ages , mainly through Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organization of PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir O@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of sie@@ ge .
the region is particularly affected by the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called on the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition have , based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was imposed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those of rebels have controlled control areas outside of Damascus , under sie@@ ge , which led to that inhabitants are reli@@ ant upon by tunnel and control points by tunnel and control points .
through long @-@ standing block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ mies teaches East G@@ hou@@ ta &apos;s inhabitants as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria , and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French Intelligence Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that have been fighting for this project for three years and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acquain@@ tance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in agreement with the NGO G@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do .
it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity in 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city locally , fuel imports will be used from plastic , to supply the generators using the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began the production of raw materials coming from the regions , before they re@@ prove their quality and whether they are suitable to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; teacher @-@ farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after further 3 months , they have now distributed mushrooms everywhere in the G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach man the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fraction of the sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food in the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , using food @-@ remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the sie@@ ge becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese people call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October at many district cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant on the north of Portugal on the week before .
forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this led the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires also were registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 pieces of fire out@@ breaks that grew out in the northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June , this occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European fores@@ try system that monitors the forest areas by satellite images , only 2017 in Portugal are approximately 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can give you a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is only in 4 bor@@ ough@@ s no fire .

numerous videos are spread within the network and show images that can provide better insights into the event :
the remov@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures through the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to have the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al , the Bund of the farmers of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are endless reports of open streets that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again like in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in eco @-@ areas with high risk @-@ risk will be raised .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the whale @-@ form , which the government had introduced in the years 2003 and 2005 , was un@@ disputed by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the construction activity by case permitted , if the applicant end@@ owed upon the means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , turned out , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires this way continues to spread .
these issues are added that the site of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking information or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : you took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of fire@@ men , and was as decisive in this f@@ ateful weekend in October , which followed the fires of the 400@@ ,000 users , who kept the fires , did not with@@ stand the site more than half a million hits .

the way from a refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneur
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati and his friend and colleague Y@@ as@@ in Tan@@ in in Venice .

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din divisions , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
just at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ i in Central af@@ gh@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother was not so happy at that time , she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominant party , E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ date had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe .
the Taliban officially came closer to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af took place in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low salary , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and a s@@ laugh@@ ed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar who were harder than he himself , in order to earn himself his living .
at that time like today , the life of af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; recalls A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site where we worked on .
there was no services in there and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t refres@@ hes at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
when dangerous crossing the sea , he suffered a boat trip and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af arrived in 2002 to Italy .
some time was As@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating to help needy .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high quality quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for the asylum seekers . it is also true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are des@@ astro@@ us .
the human rights organization Civil Defence Union for Europe writes , &quot; the system &quot; is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seekers will accomo@@ date in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased staff . &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a centre of exposure , once they have officially placed an asylum application - which after the registration of the asylum application can still be drawn once a month .
until then there are people who don &apos;t have money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his uns@@ ur@@ ach@@ ful life @-@ part helped a@@ shar@@ af to relie@@ ve himself from these conditions soon .
after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this ran so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and a lim@@ el@@ lim@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ke@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - one Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film received the Venice City Award , which was already presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the barriers .
according to un@@ official estimates around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans developed companies , including cutting , travel agents , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant talks about the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome also are invited to Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals go far beyond Italian food stalls and retailers , and aim back to the land which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know my people suffer .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and need to get the same options as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ f won plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and endurance techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop over@@ flows in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey himself . now , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen @-@ Report : legislative resolutions from Egypt allow de@@ priv@@ ation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody .

the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft law , which provides that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authorities .
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful Legisl@@ ation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their expul@@ sion number .
who will miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the withdrawal of a criminal payment .
the law , which was advertised by sixty German @-@ members , is currently under legislative as well as the constitutional committee of parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
may , a further member of the Parliament adopted a legislative proposal to be introduced to the har@@ dening of the President or to a high officials .
under Egyptian law the ins@@ cription of President as well as state institutions is already stra@@ f@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such a crime would be ins@@ cribed with jail and fin@@ es , so far @-@ right of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian poli@@ cem@@ an , demonstrated against the military put@@ sch who had led against the military put@@ sch of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ors who were arrested at the same incident , four years in detention on a court complaint .
recently , his hear@@ ings was postponed to the 20th of May because the j@@ ail@@ ability to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of the prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree , that of other states , illegal , illegal assembly , murder and trial @-@ genuine murder .
in another case , a criminal Court spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested by the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisian activists to sc@@ anned documents
in May the Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the accessories of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been rog@@ ated to an increased action plan . owned plan comes from the President of the Republic , which according to the plan expressly supports a controversial draft law , which would guarantee the business@@ men and during the former regime by dic@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption of the Official am@@ nesty decre@@ es , provided these all non @-@ law@@ fully preserv@@ ate money .
this document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at document , casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the legislative situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nom@@ ination of its sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Centre which journalists ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the district court in Tunis on 9 May , as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to put up their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission to write or share messages in social media .
the provisions will also indicate that the registration will be required with the full rule .
analysts expect that anonymous comments in social networks are to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities use these regulations .
Chinese citizens have suggested in social media to achieve these regulations only selective in order to protect citizens journalism and its independence .
do we then see in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
