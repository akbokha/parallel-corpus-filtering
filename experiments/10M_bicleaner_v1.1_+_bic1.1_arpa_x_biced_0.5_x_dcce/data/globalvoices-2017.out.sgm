<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA for at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American writers and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had profound effects on me that I was mainly because of an American cinema.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, who played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican, a frightless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnates who wanted to fill the Supreme Court of judges who were opposed to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after method Man," "" "I was" "" "as if it is the absolute truth, I forgot everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I said always: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance within a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warm love letter written about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then, Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, how he is surrounded with its mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, such as a former colleague, expressed it and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latino, African American, and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won in the Republican election, was the highest number formed by the party nominate candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and his electorate in line with the people I met at Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example, my professor, Dr Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, perceives people from all over the world, a profound human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps World views do not correspond with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Lumps insure is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr, who struggles for her life for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family, which treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor does she fit to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose direct advice has helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and they embodied through them in depth my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">As Trump initis his way to the nominee of Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook this things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the trump-voters as racism.</seg>
<seg id="34">To subordinate people, said one of my friends, is exactly what brought us to that situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and disrespectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which are most white, have voted for Trump because they would like to regain control of a country which she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who recharge the cruel decision to look down a man who look down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Tm.).: as much as" "" "leaning of the white against all other ethnicities;" "" "vocabulary from white in backlash to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as" "" "skid" "", "as it was the great Van Jones, has just been killed, what America has done so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have, America is all welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a voiced "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "brood the quantity." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latino have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "answer them." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vociferous "NEIN."</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words," "" "thank God to Mr. Trump, is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps land, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "recycled instrument Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That music which is played in both places has not only changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the brink of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is popular among tourists but is far from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestras played by children and adults in the symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments have found a way to overcome them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banden-violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot which started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of the school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch they will go through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You will always come laughing and with brilliant eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest, lgos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura play - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital is - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recharted instruments, made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where recycling under management of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the waste into instrument.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, Celli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trombones and percussion, all made from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, remember the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on the instruments of a recharted material and which is called The recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest people like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from rubbish-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication is part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was well-known that this ship had already been operated in liberian waters illegal fishing before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were below accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legislative rebrecher of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to sacrifice one of their harbors and refused to give him a fishing event.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused to" "", "Benedict Kiilu, a senior assistant of the Kenyan Fisheries authority. he is part of a team who discovered and followed the ship at the same time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices intersect and safeguards was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 certified by the NRO Stop illegally Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, who at that time the prime minister had driven out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden if it is extremely difficult to detecting it. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentional disregard to existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while promotions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snow-fired combined with the information between individual countries, the actions occur today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea using satellite channels.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fishing in forbidden areas. also, so suspects that a ship invites its prisoners on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such surveys can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on their way and possibly also whether they have a criminal balance.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, can deny the acceptance of such vessels in their ports, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to overhead penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing will not be worthwhile anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i supports it.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in total sales, which overpass the eight members of the HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen who invade in eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing, which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world. under these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices, including actions are like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of phantasy, the fishing-protected species and the fishing in nature reserve areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are targeting the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organized control system," says Long. "" "" in the past a ship could be illegally fishing and a country could then say "" "" you can't speak my harbour too "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and exactly this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has criminal networks revealed that had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used multiple fraudulent identities and it has been tracked and found ringing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organized crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect ships of precise vessels.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to enumerate the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects various information levels to each other. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminals in larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations do actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth in common with Google and the marine reserves Oceana opens the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite channels and can be viewed through the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals, they also terrify them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were formerly scattered without a license and had little to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now experienced a 33% rise in fishing sales, since then buy fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa a few hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined together, the so called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the target of even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state in Somalia could announce his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under wrong flag - and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen of Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 put a strong mark that they act against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works across the entire world ocean.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum against the president NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the regression of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also held in other parts of the country - amongst others in the residential area Barinas, in the MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in central-north-located Bundestaat Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by a acute shortage of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the prospects of NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance for a fundamental change, but in the end, the management of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, concludes:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, where the inflation and powers of violence are among the highest ones all over the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As the meantime, he said Quijano in the frame of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>

<seg id="208">At that time I was not able to realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmerciful. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Department 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was struck with a boy who made combat sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All nessed him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo, asking me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass just that they don't waste you one day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionists of the People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "parties in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would be a secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my Father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda, propaganda, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">During the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to emigrate. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just about anything.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a great chump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were put down and entertained me with an watchpost.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed out an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewn in and saw a couch where men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>

<seg id="348">On a shield, the Japanese word on Earth (Coreillsha), the "older" motorists, "may be mistaken - maybe also by means of goats & # 8212; when" terrible motorists "was translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from the 1st to 20th of September to read electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was often shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local time-newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the designation "Hula" (German: "terrible motorists") was later replaced by the reasonable, though not entirely correct term "elder" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Foundation applied for the translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the bug was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely hope that older people were offended by the poor correction (the translation) of our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For crossing, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to learn active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with mother tongue. in general the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the language language - should be native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">That is how a French mother language should be translated from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue, the translations into English. this may result in lacking understanding of excessive, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have any foreign staff, can make translations nevertheless operate in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered to be the best, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbs and puzzling sets which arise by machine translation, show that this technique is not yet to replace a human translator for a long time. this holds true for several languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, among them also the puzzling prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo from Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or from government who have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serial source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, the 7th of April, Venezuelan Internet users, that they could not have access to the online station Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet sites were no longer accessible from VPITV and El Capitolio TV.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online radio stations rushed to the protests of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionists who oppose the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and had transferred the Parliament's responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was folded, and recommended to Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It appears that Internet sites venezolanischer providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezolans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have hesitant since 2014 in reporting about protests. at that time, the commission threatened with telecommunications and lockings, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, given the Commission to call this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astonishing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinia confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a block of the Domain Name System (DNS) but also two other on-line radio stations. this also concerns the website that the National Assembly has over its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous post-research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local internet provider will have to use DNS. this is a technique based on the DNS server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds or deny the request when calling for such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third knitted channel, the transfer was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who had crossed the protests in Caracas live in detention.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later he was released and VPITV went back to the show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government has regulated the Internet connections, thus the Venezuelans of access to multi-media reporting on the current events in the country is still impeded.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga, in this house never was treated like a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, one calls in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money handed over their underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned, however, is that the children do not have to pay for a countless day household work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a treaty which you cannot be lifted up.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the involvement and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered witnesses, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against Criadita is guaranteed in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "there is the family that their daughter believe in believing that they will be able to complete their education, improve their position in society and" "" "make something out of themselves" "", "to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes up the girl and justify their exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise receive no training and perhaps even starve.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is crafted, his family will experience it only many years later.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed a lot of heavy punches. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military hospital TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a beamer at the Einwohnerdeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived in the house of VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck us as long as a stick to MarÃ­n until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the young girl's life.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the Jewish child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted in the paraguayischen Gesellschaft of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest, and demanded that there could be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay is more cows than children registered," mourned Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without Papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for an excellent investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before judgment, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be indicative - for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo court.</seg>
<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas are exploited not only as manpower, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, went bankrupt and lost her father his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all working and started to sell in the street or the market of sweets for earning money.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, they had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepare breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example purifying the fridge, mute the living room, polished the furniture and desinfused the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at an end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had even had dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had to go hungry, but didn't get an unbounded meal. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the landlord's library to eat as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroener, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings of the landlord Alvarenga, in addition to him and to read editorial from Oppositionists such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media through the regime of dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he held it for intelligent, but did not keep up with her." "" "the landlord had someone who listened while he spoke about politics" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn to" bad habits "there. thus, they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the Indigenous group of the GuaranÃ­, would be home to their native Guarani.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the formation, which they had enabled her to lose again, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them, paid with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminated against. "a thing about which almost never talked about, harassment and the rails who are exposed to Criadita when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that somebody who has no parents, is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in time when friendships arise, I particularly clear that I was not part of any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="481">In January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share advertisements for cleaning personnel and children's maids in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administration of the group is PEPA Kostianovsky, a city council in the district of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her.</seg>
<seg id="484">To learn.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please enlist yourselves.</seg>
<seg id="486">Start from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman caught out of the place Ãemby wrote that she had a eldest girl and gave her phone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came out of Ãemby, offered her 15-year-old nightly. "she likes small children and is very pretty," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the third commentary was written by "a girl from the inland that would like to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the fibers in the display turned out once again:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear friends, I have found one. I look at it works with her.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you, I do write again if something is.</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history we managed to lay down systems like slavery, CuÃ±adazgo (a economics), the Conquistadores, the women of the Guarani (scenslavement and Spanish indoctrination. therefore, it is impossible to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery during which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changes by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed a draft legislation to "regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is adopted by the Parliament, beneficiaries, and users of social media have to register with a governmental authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law a place would be set up, giving citizens a permission to give people permission to use social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of adoption of the law, users would have to register with their correct names and recruitment numbers in order to enable social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">Will there be failed to do this, so that could cause a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a money-book.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft bill which consists of six paragons and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any weaving application, which runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video, and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities want to account the users and users the registration. unclear is also the fact that the Egyptian government is unable to register for regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Amandus, Parliament members and sponsors of the legal situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and a password from the telecommunications Ministry, and a password "to move through the firewall, the Facebook block."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean Egypt is planning to set a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to obtain information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">Yet it is not so far known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the ground are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "senior research") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), "told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of jedno authority in Egypt regarding things to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they suggest that just as they can control violently physical public and private spaces it could be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they will establish a strong monitoring system to apply citizens rallies, who apply for permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to engage in a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in legislative and constitutional committees before it enters into the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "stands in accordance with a pro-military hierarchy in parliament, whose sense is maximised and safeguarded that no deviation of fiction is present on the picture surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Tamer El-Shahawk proposed a legislative base for cyber crime in which a lifelong prison sentence was intended to be found guilty of the "public order" and "protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fragmentation of their habitat, and since they find less and less booty.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only tranged prey in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large robbery is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards really is low in the wild and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore states that they have a shot of a great cat in camafall, Raza breaks out in pure pleasure.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the advances made in the past six years have been hit to rebuild the lives of those who were hit by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear accident in Fukushima had sparked the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a Prefect Prefectures in Japan northeast, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring regions of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had evacuated whole coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, the prefecture of Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, and already had to leave 160 000 inhabitants from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report by Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been reached after six years, in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese reconstructions as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare farmhouses (in the evenings, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">For the biggest success among the three prefectures, Miyagi could record, 80 percent of the planned spare homes were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima makes the final light with 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, one always strive for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsacu (in the event, cascitsu juutaku) in final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 thousand people were forced to live in accommodation shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such persistence.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the evacuation from Fukushima still lived in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 per cent of evacuation supplied after the disaster in tourist shelters, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwock, the number is here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">Prefect of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to establish 1074 from 1100 schools that were affected by the disaster, its doors by December 2016 was reopened, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">"" "" "" "six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefect states is much more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of fishing villages in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, at Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing villages have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, have drawn up a large scale in the three prefectures of agrarian agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of crops in Iwata and less than 50 percent of arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only one consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed in arable lands of Fukushima, are in the "nuclear waste area."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures of Prefectures, tourism has recovered over again, but also here Fukushima still stays far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwata are again at 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants, it's more difficult to find their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to establish an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the indigenous people and under the evacuation. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how their emptlements changed over against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents who have taken action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in matters of disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had evacuated the fueling from the Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also directed its attention to the situation of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and disastrous tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disaster relief, nuclear accident, the Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 thousand people, back to Fukushima, were settled in long-term spare homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation areas are still older than 50 years old. they fail to bring back in correct expeditions because efforts to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If people encounter people from other countries, speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, you often see that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly this global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat topics that have often received less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices Members who recall a moment that they have felt very strong connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care centre: last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia with a striker against the head. nationwide, millions of protesters took part in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, the social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s studied, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors carried him on this Saturday and have put him in an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The face of the police officer is to recognize the face of the police officers, who attacked with a leaning. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian federal state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio has been completed by an active service in case of an active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests at GoiÃ¢nia with his blows at the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officers were logged by a demonstrator and land in the intensive ward, his face would look for six months on TV and the entire oppression would thus be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press-channel from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video on the net, where you see how Mateus is attacked by the police officers and several paramedic briefly pointed out to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the below clip you can see the attack on Mateus on the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who live in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilians (about 2,700 euros) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to remain at GoiÃ¢nia while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s in memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political force: here the activist Guilherme Irish was killed by his father because he was sabotage the Occupy School by Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman, who has attacked him by a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil when it came to brutal Police in the past Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen took a stage in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubber bullets and lurengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), the police asked the police to give up violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers around the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media has dismissed the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a paperback glass window in order to design their title-page illustrative with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">"" "on the other hand, the O Globo preferred a title story with a" "" "fire" "" "fire." ""</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a discontinuous windshield, than about the protests of thousands who serve to defend a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also acknowledge that if one is strictly opposed to any kind of kind damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">The term "Vandalism" is also an absurd, unproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police are falsified by headlines with the title "protesters on the confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Exclusive villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Law of Ãlvaro Reynoso included almost hundreds of sugar cane plants in all of Cuba the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly referred to as el Central - in Spanish sugars - known regardless of the fact that there are no appreciable sugar-harvests on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar tube factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the grounding, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its investments, until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some change the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resignified and commute daily to the factories that are still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, which is up every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar beet factories in the east of the region, who have been in operation after a long inactive time because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene did not remember exactly that in MaÃ±ale I would obtain the sugar rohrates, but the promise has not been held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugars industry have already contradicted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvest is already no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway junction of the municipality looked even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity: the 155-sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became importable to the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">Only they left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations, as well as the rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar rates increased just about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the administrative and food organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the present production would achieve the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw-sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>

<seg id="653">Since then the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar plants, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Swerohrfabrik Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez since 1967 worked in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, says about the closing of the factory, the word he says most is" "" "cheating" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place will be preserved, they set up a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first end of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that would be removed only in terms of the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could authorise every decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">Since then the responsibility was passed and the letters were always more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the tackled factory two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still operation in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will in the stillation of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>

<seg id="692">People of the First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with issues that are important to them. they do this using Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014 Workshoppers bring directly to schools and youth centers to teach youthful songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in northern Quebec with ten cree community and then worked with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop reveals that the young participants in talks on topics such as "cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance, or whatever comes in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. federal state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school "Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, explains the story of the highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a road section in Westcanada, where almost two dozen men usually disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, even though the young people not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has taken, the chorus is sung on cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a Stanzhe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan is at your disposal Stanzhe, just as a translation into English, translated into German:</seg>

<seg id="708">Because as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will raise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are placed near the entrance hall sanokuhin sandy puru (where the "plastic models of the dishes") is displayed by every dish that serves in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see this plastic gifts and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to making these plastic gifts.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the mutilted district Kappabashi there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes, which the German filmmakers Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga for over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese people these plastic products are so common that they don't even fret them any more. however, a new trend is transformed today into a showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new equipped with plastic shelves as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, refrigerant magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokug refrigerant magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essentials will become more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a caste-don has been transformed (a popular travel bag with seafood) into a mobile-state support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as mobile-handed cord.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that does capture your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to see how an apple can be seen, with a candle for the cell, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing tinge.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile-handed and mobile-designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon-gens is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say to you:" "" "wow, cool, now I can provoke my mobile phone with salmon-rogens?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic gifts can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile phone-stand has the shape of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried black salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the desolate and cumbers are regularly appearing in statistics. but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy, which this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every corpse, behind any bone fund in the hundreds of enclosures, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico launched the digital project "Aprender a vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking), which aims to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who have rived in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not just allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug sellers and all communities therefore have to ride many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The anguish of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear life changes") relates exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who seeks out every weekend of secret tombs after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, which in just one day lost their father, their four siblings, her husband and two of their nephew.</seg>

<seg id="771">You are the assurance of my father, but it didn't get them out, because the mortgage require a mortgage.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con of Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only need to show the faces of those who fear to fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and government leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what type it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come by newspaper kiosk every day and see the title-pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I'm the only one that is disgusted or sad. it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent at all or consider this normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks he is Narco (German: drug dealers) wants him when he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is like those who have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear that they too have happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are exposed to mere figures in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor to be justified by that they were" "" "replacency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to get involved that they will be spared by such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "four months Ertortion in the capital city district." in it, it describes how armed criminal month was pressed by their business until they end up not only the business but also had their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never pass, the trauma will remain, the fear comes back high, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether I would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to cries, I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation signed by force."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missed wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a watchful and he tells him that he had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for all the life of violence that she had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who was shot by armed men by a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw such a:</seg>
<seg id="810">In 2006 Bryan was born in 2006, when violence through organised crime and the struggle against it was mixed with the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of Ministers on public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Prosecutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of the hundreds of thousands of thousands, who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and invade them into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a vivir Con El Narco," the data journalistic project initiated the data journalistic project of Narcodata. its aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as proof of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages linked with it were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original release of 2010, the image ultimately might be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) who pass these postings. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the upheaval of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the deprivation of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing will use the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth checking how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who are intentional to seize the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggesting this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted the real atrocity from what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of tremendous images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that rejection of images of a refusal equates, to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images readers and audience desensitise and accept them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, the studied, such as violent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot regarding rapamer writing in the news media, fact is that it is essential for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Follow technologists as with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will need to contemplate thoroughly about situation in which a picture can suggest something that is actually also derived from the context or completely mischievous kind can be used.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false grants should also take into consideration how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (eg. untranslatable) makes every effort to provide language enthusiastic to a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in any language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these insurmountable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobrekesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resisting stubbornly any attempt at an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist von "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find example words from Vanuatu for example:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- BemÃ¼h you for your parents in recognition of how to make you effort in your recent years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunscreen language spoken in parts of Brazil as follows:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- Comfortableness, or laziness that you feel after spending cold days in the sun." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, revealing other ideas and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even want to show more this "insurable word" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">You must tize me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be Muslim, to different art. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim reserve.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer in our collective imagination is so well designed that as soon as Muslims, which as I do not fit in there, are unMuslim.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unwaistable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages would not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create towns, diversity - secure spaces, where residents do not have to forget who they are to assign.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often with it" "" "to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to" "" "to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers form their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation makes it possible that the audiences can be guided through it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as if the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storytellers Rassidatou also takes the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of narratives.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having said the meaning of his tale, John Nyamusara was asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytting tours.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian website Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is known for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom, and remind him of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on the digital culture, organized in Berlin, devoted an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, manager at Book Sprints, a publishing house made by so-called 'book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lasen excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book which was published last year and is licensed here license-free, contains a number of papers that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book will discuss how movements for Free knowledge are built and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have been working side by side to watch over the fog that surrounds our newsletters and to create something out of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was repainted from the Aalto's List in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information whatsoever about its present state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us have to let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we draw?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi reported that the" military police "Basket marked the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that they were contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 that placed themselves as an insider of Assad's government and acknowledged it by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologian and at the moment overhead the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle cultural prototypes were prescient as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyra virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the waymark of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything in it, this architecture that not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike into the digital archaeology and the conservation has made a time period created for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable importance.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">In addition to the book, Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with it, dream of freedom and bump taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English in, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each he has asked. he has taught other incarcerers to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to the technology. he taught me, to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees as they use computers, at least theoretically, without being in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a profiled smell which she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 in her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Moroura have worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smugged the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or lost under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrian in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for release from Bassel for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our call today in the hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger in a corrupt, where a government member returned to the workplace half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">These are diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public transit of the airports of Mozambique, whose Council got Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza is released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately asked for his reinstatement to the company what happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the prosecutor's prosecutor of the Republic, which claimed the application, there would be no obstacles for Cambaza to refer back to his old posts as the company was not disciplined after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Yet many of the inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Health (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), an local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "it represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clearly indicated the lack of transparency and is even a step with regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should lead a lack of discipline against the restrageous.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"" "" "" "however, the firm seems to be inconspicuous and prompted no appropriate legal steps to use the respective functions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Mozambican social media, rejects this behavior as well and considers the case to be "" "" resist "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would have advisors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and which half of them went.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could consult and record his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has granted himself to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To be contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of Political Science in Brazil says the director no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I can not believe that someone was rewarded with such a way that the state has already so massive offended.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is lacking morals and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead she has only served on the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handler it became an inexhaustible bill of money and the state itself became weary of this man who was precharged and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded with such a reward.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte favored it, the Prime Minister of Mosambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to the prison Samora Machel, the Mosambique will not only remain in memory for ever as a first independent president, but also as a sharper, cutting edge and by side - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"" "one of his most famous oral representations was when he dictated that" "" "a ambitious man was capable of everything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, its own individual interest." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics but he does not change his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">A ambitious man is a criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also discontinued:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down for 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar Pae" "" "means chickpeas or trace." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people east-Indian origin or generally use as an adjective" "" "infirm" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or of an initiative, as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely ablution connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically collect hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts in order to be expressed in the purpose of his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with the different meanings which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (column), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookess Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, if they knew how he could soothe his back pain by playing a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the fracture (la) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hdens is the opinion that she is likely to reduce her speech of radical nationalist, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it ignites all of the postings that appear in suspicion to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook extinguishes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism is not understood what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the side words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (column).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to be circumcised by its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may transmit a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy doesn't seem to last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Fembo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords are often a cattery and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply to begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word in order to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung myard described how Facebook began to clear his postings, when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and sent to me the light, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because of the post "the Facebook community" was not dismissed. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of examples removed from people who have no negative purposes or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country have been bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine thinks that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for advice issues:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems that without a local context or technical support and as words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peancurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't tried to correct the falsified posts that have been deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they have a great deal of revenue, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of derision under users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now aware of Facebook and consciously feel the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their postings are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts who contained no hate speech, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the burial text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and see an inheritance of an Indian movie." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out whether Facebook is the post office which contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, which have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks will add violence to the churches in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure, the exhilarating hate speech to bring on its Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better on the context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were endeavouring to lay laws on the kindergarten, followed on the foothills and also gratifying great support. without doubt they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-leader, for example, had no concern to say the critics of children, they should take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition made for tensions in this actually unusual thing, and at some point out of doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the draft bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and no one on the other.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary barriers needed to wear the core of the matter, but do you know what? the marriage-marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago for now, and that is worth every price.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the General-General Advocate General Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimately, if Maharaj would act against the law, most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so general, in a way that only talk about panic and discomfort, if we're talking to the state, our daughters guard safeguards that they may be abused by large, hard-minded men who are compared to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1390">The mirrors of web sites can view Turkish users again from Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia-page was presented on January 18, 2012, opposite to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally presented.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been dragging the popular and crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day will be more significant, how important the platform for users is to find and share information helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans of TV-series repel against the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many more technologically advanced Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article by the New York Times) that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey was subject to article by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second-known country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary Uses File System), as the platform initiates all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite legal prohibition however.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we listened to the news (on the block of Wikipedia), we put everything in snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents at decentralized and distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view all of the Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely addressed to screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has created both tr.vikiansipedia, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrorsites when the country is suspended in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member, as well as employees at Mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Network "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of one proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You have access to a different URL, which is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia side, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is run by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivates him to carry a camera with him and try to understand the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar makes every effort to bring an international stage to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos, which direct the attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I had just returned home, when suddenly he called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard was.</seg>
<seg id="1425">River dam is just a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I was running with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was lying and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to attain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already standing on face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep.</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the advancement of Nepalese and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he took a tiger photographed and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again released as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are committed to speaking with the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they should respect the husband's social pressure as well as fear of the consequences, they should understand the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state Odisha, by a sluent, judged by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also not name their wives to name, is also common among men. however, they have far less accremittances to fear if at all, they should not be redirected to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became one of the main debates about the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">One of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, is part of the # Khelbadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pap has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the uncovering of practices, such as children's heating up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Instructed, and runs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they also have made them ambassadors of change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in its discussion showed, acted by women who did not name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she would open a conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can identify easily.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Saying not to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a bread which holds it all dutiduously maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman that does not dwell alone is seen as a reflection, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is rooted as deeply that we have never thought of it up to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband in the name, try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion about her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini talks:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband dashed for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on at his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage Proini started its first discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked anyone," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini talks:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was just wondering during the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole aned frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush of having broken with an age-old bread, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she came down, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participating in was less understanding and the situation arraged in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini said how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinded red spot on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the galvanic point if he was doing it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not stop completely, but they think they are in a better position, even to choose him not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion group is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at any discussion group." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack our lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who what could be heard," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and nevertheless I have made some things, such as our identities on our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to our clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have supported only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of that is okay, but some wanted a Salad spa, a vast shirt over a pants, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussion of the advantages of his own clothes, morality joined with the Saris and much more, mugglers' its own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months following the first discussion of the discussion, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming to its roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only taken small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two shall say the name of their husbands. now one or two women are now carrying on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group should know that the changes they want to achieve within their lives - like the haste of more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reported to other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A picture of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which probably has recently been made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally released on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissertation Liu Xiaobo had attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized in the hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison because of "Subversion" (public debt) after he had filed a manifesto on the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which had filed the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China said Lius Fall as an "internal matter," and said a spokesman, He used it as "not required to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to call for calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, and allow him to make a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reaction from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">"" "however, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu abroad for treatment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Bringing refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government is urging that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until the end of December last year. only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon until China, since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Once the news had spread that Liu was seriously fallen ill, the Nobel Committee brought up his hope for a unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of its deport he was unable to violate its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision to immediately liberate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum made available to provide adequate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP previously that Liu wife, Liu Xia, told him every day, but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to contact someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada demands China to protect its international humanitarian obligations, including freedom of expression, to uphold freedom and exercise for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's State Department ordered China in an explanation on June 29 on, Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news sender France info has already reported that the French government would be welcomed to Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will eventually take him up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of festivities in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Liu and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who are campaigning for peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Party (EPP) called for China also on the sick of the intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in a statement on June 28 at Liu, and gave many people asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>

<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should look at Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting during a meeting of the International Bicist Association of the State of New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because in Singapore they are compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore that Singapore should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the killings, an obligation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in the face of its, it inevitably appeared non-democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, it defends the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities who are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the subject again the good old grief of the authoritarian rulers appear to be prettier, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">At the end of the last week of Shanmugam there were answers to its American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He called for appropriate questions with non-responses to rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country is part of our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmuggle" "" "would take the trouble to clear this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the city government." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should start reading the entire connexion of the conference, in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugglers in the better way, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the story.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said, Singapore was more of a "city," said, why the elections in Singapore were so unequally important, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He led Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously doesn't meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, such as polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said, very confused...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that expects me - whether I disagree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes it, is correctly associated and aware of what it defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review zersets the weaknesses of Shanmugams Argumenten:</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices, Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is most put to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I am sorry," "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and returned to Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutors by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarifications then most often the default response: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook wardly in front of anger when they are held for Americans, but me does not bother.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag to be visible in their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I started travelling 20 years ago, to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>

<seg id="1758">Canada is supposedly regarded as the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends whom I appreciated very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would mean nothing if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the punch "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" to be described, is basically to be intrigue - like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically insubstantial figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has a own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be inconspicuous and inconspicuous and do not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things around you happen.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a leading piece of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders as' nice ', is maybe simply just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not often talking about the fence with neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks the warm, open kindness that I have meanwhile connecting with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau stepped on stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what authority he makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the Music video relates indirectly to the continued military power of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie-Chaplin Video "dictator" was blocked in Thailand following a group of activists asking the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, especially how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, shutdown, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of the Russian and exhaust-hares live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost cities in Abchums.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war era more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011 the total population of the district 16,000 people had risen after over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">Cross the road of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexicans, a small woman with a coral-pink feather-gestell and gold-colored ear-rings in Teddy bear-bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haiti that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with high numbers, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost about the hotel - but still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people are told in full busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some of them have already slept on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse any one.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they can not pay, they massaging them with a balm that made from the long journey exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracking.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes" "" "yes," "" "I really reply with a smile." I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a normal stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other wayfarers of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitian and Africans often travel the route together and that, Africans had already speaking to Whatsapp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his companion, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a builder for construction of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," he answered smiling. "we will always be in touch forever."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez narrated that their guests often send their messages, if they have gone to grats or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez, perhaps very well-known, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants that are travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter the Valenzuela and his family are taken in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are here, mainly Haitianer.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are performing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have seen what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived three years, he was reported in a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled with his wife and three children before men who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and a well-known, a single out, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later the family lives forever and they try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In courses, travelers are quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she fed her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter's daughter with African hairs who made her a lady, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs when she is presenting her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeated her every time. "you have already gone."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, to the far / or</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile user in Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi was a cell phone call, in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication, the app is said to" "" "prevent the app" "" "to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">Yet, the authorities would also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because it was shortly after they had replaced the app, which had exchanged messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the press release, the app recognizes the sources and the distribution routes of terrorists and follow, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "", "including videos, images, books and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective services with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornography websites, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and manage their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "state actors or even hacker can manipulate the home network of a person or steal them." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While we focus on digital censorship in China mostly on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often grimmer for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinous Internet isolation.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media outlets from mainland China, "hosted the censored news in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint, where policeman unrazed the residents optionally as a result, whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert notification calls for people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be incarcerated up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback on technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances needed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (or on the previous part) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password's claim for a Windows operating system, and with it full access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are stored in Xinjiang on electronic manual.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are potentially a response to the instructions of the city of party, to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the data security office instructions in operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report of Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all the residents and entrepreneurs, to the 1st of August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million, and gives them penalties for quite a number of other possible merits, including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan appers Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in its studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time indoors; sometimes he strove to his canvas, sometimes his computer, and then also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But on which one can rely, is a cigarette between its fingers or its with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives at the top of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced their families to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felhedra (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"" "" "" "for six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and scrutinize their well-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapism." ""</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often faced with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in his hometown Amman Relativity, but also in towns that are wealthy from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not limited in his mind by borders, and he can sympathise according to his own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he is sending a particular disinclination to the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib don't believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, something with his identity as a "Palestinian feiting of the second generation" - so he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my personal circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that because I am a man," while he praising a man in water as a cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims from dawn to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordant law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a dominating hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the loopies speak of the warm coffee and the waistles of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if one throws a view into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens said a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians to support the Islamic State's Front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontswoman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert will be.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "had just been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila said the jordant people as" "" "progressive support of human rights" "", "which continue to be decided" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to not simply be the rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan reflect that seems clear in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to corps by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a apparently broken man, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the last few years in Jordan the number of 'Honour' Honour 'has increased to the unofficial outside world.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Citizen reached its climax in 2016; however, it is still aggravated that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried to support the victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law of breaking-breaking violence from 1954, women can be detained at incertain time in prison, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family needed that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for those not to shy away from themes which have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib takes that his work is political, and is, however, that he is his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was driven to politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib is the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" Ghareeb "" "," the focus is on poverty. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are in the core politically, can be further developed.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what one wants "- be faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly someone in Jordan on the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on gender equality by LGBTQ + -individuals were heavily censored until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib concluded an interview for the popular Jamaican news program Roya, to later notice that his comments were swept away from the context, and had been censored to his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuttings- but only a working version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib buys open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poem.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who later on behalf of the Caliph, was supposed to write in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier that not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemial kingdom it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of speech and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordant news service took several former government members and members of the teacher association, with the reason they had expressed critically on their comments in social media and expressed deep problems with the corruption that deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given this, the concert of Hdaib's opinion is not only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has forbid for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks slow, depressing and inwardly changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dream, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions of foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming not only of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, interdependence and artificial type, led democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will pass over and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman listens to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriers are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One presumes that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually hailed in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory implies that the celebration, the drummers and the tances were over a thousand years, and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan to the north-marched to force the indigenous residents of the region, the Emihi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we got a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint Centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been looking back to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two celebrations are to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">But for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival to spend the only true way in this summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and I looked at the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high rock was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were external appearances and bodycare as important as in this story, because they help to keep away the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's major port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where roadblocks and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to having more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the most extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity, even has inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts together to show who can create from them the most eccentric Looks, as you can see in the next video (see further videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who find themselves in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people, exchange their weapons against airdressing tools and instead of poor advice providing training in hair style, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered by dozens of young people have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school presented special educational workshops prior to the school year's school year and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love's love for guerilla</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the following version of the paper "love of love in guerilla," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who do not feel fatigged with affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation to become the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), and the young people engendered to write guerilla by letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was her country venue of a historic events and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombian), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally the signatories of the peace agreement was so important that the Columbian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But it is still a long way to the columbors until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried around the clock in their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society again, which had become accustomed to life in fear and in some cases. hate against guerilla, must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young columbikers coincided together and would have to help with the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla, to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerilla, which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters for reconciliation arose in the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi in 2014, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write by thousands of love's letters by Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told it, this year he told his love to share with people who were expecting the most urgent support.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now to find their place in society and become a new life. "these letters will show that the Columbian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities, like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i had never thought that someone would forgive me. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on March 19 in one of the UN camp in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt reists in the camp to transfer letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were focused on how they had done it before, to follow the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands but letters of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies in between," told the policy scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a collaborator of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed down the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, in which the guerilla-fighters live) I saw a guerilla, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet designer, a deadly weapon in the thorn sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said he said to him and asked:" "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "I answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone wrote me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answered. "and suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced it quite firmly and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was sorry, he was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits with open arms for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">As a result, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a panel discussion together.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of FARC said the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice from the state to develop on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this scale it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people heard that had never been heard before and had no election right, and to realize that people that I often had seen as monsters and even hate too, even people with beautiful feelings, which were reversed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who killed and have killed so much damage, can teach us a little and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianism was prophesied that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without arms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defender of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to it - to rise above all that dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, contribute to our contributions and bring victims, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will come up many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he excrept them to his cheethenish friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Afterwards the photos of my documents made the lap of the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was just about creating a few baskets from my car's home, I heard a man's voice:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I feel something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on the Chechen:" "" "how long are you going to dishing the family, you swell?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I assumed that I faded two ffaded in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals are you put into place - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with the fear of doing it; it was a Muslim, a caudal name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - Related, alien, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by being above without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a devout woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a striker around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors got and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and only a few hours later it was a car with dark windowded windows and a numerical plate with a 95 mood.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that there was nothing lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-brothers-friends overlooked the numerical depictions - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to disclose their name, but I will say I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something inbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought myself a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without having to register without a statement, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe about, you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stagious. you even know your number number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about sex. however, we do not talk about sex.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish, these spiritual barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually give me trouble how the person should look at that it reminds themselves from her past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed here?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I made a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the later, I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has included one and a half months in the gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there was no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait and he didn't shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that I, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are currently still vibrating men stuck in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said, there would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then in particular those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives were dropped to place themselves Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be converted, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but rather submerged to eradicate oneself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was personally involved when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. we suspect such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could you not allow these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who hear a so-called "nontraditional" orientation, already taking place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already in 2003 I was already known in Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to approach the" "" "civil war" "" "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were corted; I had colored lashes, carried the tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of security of sharia has never slipped to me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people who met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte is not the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children, if they make yourself funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so you just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these Gnat times held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister 2005, he started talking about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us by se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people in town started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had previously saluted and borrowed, look at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could sense how the situation in the Republic has ever disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity will you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I mean not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacup information, I guide them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">For a long time I have no penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clade the hiding place.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: contribute to Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">In this way nature is pure and nothing has to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who do not want to prophesy you with foam prior to the mouth, that there are no gays by them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the cabines have which, the Russians have, and on all the planets there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mosque and during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a Truglock.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of sensation, in order to be exact, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to stay here as personal, but my last intimate relationship is now over a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I simply know I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of self-murder within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>

<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of Iran live in Iran live in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago the arabic Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlai monarchy prevailed, and in 1925, undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most distinguished and valuable utility for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing slowly, and the local people only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated disease, hunger and hardships.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Irish-Nazi-Arabs systematically with jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of dams built, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to devastate the devastation in the region by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi-juveniles now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Directorate-General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, announces that 5% of Ahwazis who finished a job, finished elementary school, 55% finished a secondary school and 45% have a diploma.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional</seg>
<seg id="2434">Details of a photo. recorded by: pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read the comments under the original text in the comments below.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say I am not a vocalist, many women react and especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well thought, scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feministic and why we generally have all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that in spite of the same formation, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across to a smooth ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and discrimination on the basis of sex can still be drawn across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I blede twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak of skin colour, on racism, on black strip-women, on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or black women, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to mention feminine feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to lift their voices and to "Kumbaya," my lord, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of an institutionalised form, which we are black women exposed to two different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or in addition, that black women and women of other ethnicities and cities of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl from school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to a higher risk with a migration background, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as a white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men jedno skin colour of the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect to a movement as a black woman whose center is the white woman who refuse to take care of injustices in her mind, which refers both to the gender and to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer fight my belonging in a white-feminist oriented sphere, which repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology, in which black woman is a purely human and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me divisions, which also absorbing our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to reveal white women the importance of overlapping skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to be the meaning of black women for feminist movement totality, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them from the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to place women of different incomes and boundaries of white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to start releasing the movement of feminism and forced me to join the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so insistent that interfering is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">It is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move forward into the spheres, which will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana Tomanism: how we can defend ourselves (for example: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves by ourselves, in which they are completely safe and can be revered in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical, and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are calling immediately separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a blurry environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and on account of my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment in which my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2467">This contribution from Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reported inspecial about international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">In the context of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published once again.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dust, the pollution and the uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organization - a subsidiary of Waterman Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa holds the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary in Erbil, Iraq, and multimedial journalist, filmed, filmed and edited.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The focus of her work lies on persecuted, little noted subcultures, and is characterized by the use of collaborative video photography and new multimedial techniques, with the help of oppressed municipalities to tell their stories their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by courier. the article belongs to the number # Porsermujer (# refuse entry), reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissary said Ada BÃ¡ez that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, its expartner who has become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was some time gone and the police said, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena pointed out because of distracts, including the acoustic indicator of Ada BÃ¡ez only.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman drew her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women do not even refund, they do not generally receive any support from the state.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name from all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At first she didn't want it, but then after. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she bore mental violence against women, one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time the most serious recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are happening that are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked the rhetorical whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen by Carlos for so long and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain role to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner is miserable.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I think") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse all in some way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2531">The original design of the law foreseeable to explain and harder to explain and harder to punish how it is in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the lawed text was changed in a number of points to also paving the way for decriminalisation of abortions that are currently banned in Paraguay in principle and be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if there is no sufficient financial means to make it available to them:</seg>

<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as something Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who sweeps in the face of these facts and contributes to the perpetrators of perpetrators of offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report as long as we do not have to carry out any more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed on the paraguayischen Senate. before, parts of the law had been modified, but among other things, a passage that had been cancelled in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure is processed with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. this is a growing area, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site: for a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious impacts than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists by building own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Information at the Centre for research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he searched for HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to assist the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I have recently developed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only apply solutions which have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is they adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">Rw: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are also handled differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">Rw: the basic infrastructure does not conform to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">Rw: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Q: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, where should they concentrate, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">Rw: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific education, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of the universe, health care (non-transferable illness) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">Rw: often, there are the limited speed to do things, and the complicated access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that tries to make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton started selling in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous Licensing, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Mortons became known only through its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more Salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone, or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cartels. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert food safety have become the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition Morton always served salad, he now needs longer since his work is more and more difficult than ever.</seg>

<seg id="2638">And if they withstand the court, no one can breed any new salutches, because all the features are already patented, "he makes it as good as possible and tries to make out those characteristics which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and makes every effort to use no material which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>

<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and -gens are not being protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, US breeders can agree that others can use the seeds to use them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others who buy seeds to breed, and it will not immediately be edicated - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant paternity or be prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined forces in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeriated Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food safety and for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds are said to play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try the latter not to use only little by raising seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, cores, genetically modified or not, are announced to the increasingly common mergers in the global agri industry, whose recent examples are being announced on farms in China and Syngenta and Monsanto, who are being offered in farmers in August and September 2016, should also know that the way that vegetables are bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional Guests without seeds "sovereignty is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit to ensuring that their seeds will continue to be available to others. thus, their approach to patrol the seeds of seeds and plant-characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because of the available gene pool because of the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which therefore is always more limited, incessantly shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has been employed in their doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartels are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There is still no such estimates for other plants but experts like Luby suspected that plants like wheat are patented in a larger scale than a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their tastes or colour improves up to such reasons, due to which it thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties prove that the available plant material for breeders by ever more patents decreases. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an E-Mail, Monsanto and Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for monsanie's activities. with a total of four gences and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining the genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that" "" "intellectual property belonging to other breeders, because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietdiets innovations promote," "" "a patent is basically taken as soon as the patent is up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these commands help others to come with another method on the same outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not impede innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait for a patent process, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for formalities, and monetary incentives are unattractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us and it becomes impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton interferes in the concept to patrol the plant-characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make themselves up themselves and as breeders we ultimately no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant seeker in the US-State Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who is growing a variety, also raising its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and moneyries, are needed for their cultivation of massaging herbicides; they grow in the varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly gentlent. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are patents, manage the most smaller seeds, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they don't keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also thinks that breeders would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patrons: "it looks like I was with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that are patrol.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know my competitors my varieties are selling for a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, and in my opinion it is very pretty easy. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.august, the Egyptian government clicked the web site of the World Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported to us.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply criticized and promised the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Network for Human Rights Information remain pale in spite of this attack and the constitution by the authorities, to concealed the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, so it was never so important to overcome these goals and not to give up. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post, and the originating network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web pages for victims fallen. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab-language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights research Team Ahmed Gamal Ziada does not have access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziemused his blog for the spread of columnists and articles that he does not write to inaccessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up, was to bypass the censored apparatus of Egypt's government, even goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Bloggers, the supplier in which also is home to the Ziadas blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security guards as he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook-comment, Ziada voiced the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The international blogs to block is very old, however, has a priority in the era of Abdelfatae al-Sisi; and even if the block of blogs may not become significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is successful to give me a sense of siege, a trial, a trial, a fragrant murder, unloading of the National Security Council, the blocking blog as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I'd like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Through and Expression (AFTE) curled Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this made technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), amongst others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the block of vendors, through redistribution of internetting and private browsing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the block of web pages that VPNs offer.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices refers to the intention of blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will additionally be worse, that the censors will be made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed from court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers are reported in the whole of Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post cards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," Jethah his second day is murdered by police officers in Rio de Janeiro, "" Diebe smoked drugstore with military weapons, "" President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and Air Force to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violence of 2017 in Rio achieved the highest stand for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government of Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "thus released the detailed report on violence in Rio" "" "Extra" "" "on August 16," "" "This is not normal" "", "in which they announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, from the civilized standard deviates and what happens only in Rio, is in the section "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a warring in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We know that a wartime of war if it is distorted, too can be used to violate atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than they benefit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira in contrast to describe the violence as "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account the person responsible in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military deployments in Rio itself - in combination with sufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-agreeable neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this was in fact lead to a decrease of tremendous deaths. for some years now, the UPP, however, after several reports on ramps and repressions against the poor congregations, which should actually protect the newly created police force.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux received from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio is not established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October at many district cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant on the north of Portugal on the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died, and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October. this led the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires also were registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 pieces of fire outbreaks that grew out in the northern and central regions of the country, about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, this occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry system that monitors the forest areas by satellite images, only 2017 in Portugal are approximately 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Just at this time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara in the province of Ghazi in Central afghistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother was not so happy at that time, she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara dominant party, Eb-e-Wahdate had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt safe.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban officially came closer to the Hazara-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf took place in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low salary, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and a slaughed sacks with mortar who were harder than he himself, in order to earn himself his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time like today, the life of afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," recalls Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite where we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services in there and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't refreshes at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">When dangerous crossing the sea, he suffered a boat trip and strangled on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf arrived in 2002 to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Assharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating to help needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high quality quotas is a kind of second chance for the asylum seekers. it is also true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are desastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil Defence Union for Europe writes, "the system" is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will accomodate in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unbiased staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a centre of exposure, once they have officially placed an asylum application - which after the registration of the asylum application can still be drawn once a month.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who don't have money for an accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there is also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unsurachful life-part helped asharaf to relieve himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years in the construction industry, Asharaf made his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and a limellimp.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the barriers.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans developed companies, including cutting, travel agents, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from various parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant talks about the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome also are invited to Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharper's goals go far beyond Italian food stalls and retailers, and aim back to the land which he had to leave as a teenager as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happy if I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and need to get the same options as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharf won plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and endurance techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop overflows in the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf did this journey himself. now, he also wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful Legislation on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their expulsion number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Who will miss this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the withdrawal of a criminal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty German-members, is currently under legislative as well as the constitutional committee of parliament and should be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">May, a further member of the Parliament adopted a legislative proposal to be introduced to the hardening of the President or to a high officials.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law the inscription of President as well as state institutions is already strafable. however, under the legislative proposal, such a crime would be inscribed with jail and fines, so far-right of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian policeman, demonstrated against the military putsch who had led against the military putsch of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protestors who were arrested at the same incident, four years in detention on a court complaint.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his hearings was postponed to the 20th of May because the jailability to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of the prison in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty on the basis of one, so many human rights groups agree, that of other states, illegal, illegal assembly, murder and trial-genuine murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal Court spoke in Giza the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi sitting on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>

<seg id="2949">This document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat document, casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the legislative situation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined the nomination of its sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Centre which journalists assures the right to protect their sources.</seg>
