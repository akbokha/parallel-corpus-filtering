this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize to the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden , wrote R@@ isen &apos;s book in which he was spectacular published that the NSA inter@@ cep@@ ted illegal phones of Americans .
it is another chapter that should give a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA has literally dra@@ fts Iran for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapters did not exist ?
the American government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against rage and urged him to call its alleged sources .
he became a symbol of the symbol for the design of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to pun@@ ching journalists .
according to the first constitutional exchange , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if they can not protect identity of the mu@@ te they cost .
so when the government near R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
therefore , R@@ isen from 2007 to 2015 lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though it would be for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porter and the sources can always hide less .
instead of going to fail and bring rh@@ isen to statements , this could also cause his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are concerned with his telephone ,
just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit card , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of its flights .
among this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens of alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers by his appearance , but instead the judiciary has more condemned more than any US governments before him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government moves too much from their work as a home .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of an wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers going to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the line that is to be protected by the first constitutional exchange because the government has more and more possibilities to expose all of them .
but just as technology of the government allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and that they may take it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect .
today there are communication software that has not been written when writing his book had written , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transm@@ itter system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed from the internet @-@ famous , developed by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , during which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as with each ordinary contact form .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer ste@@ er information secretly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the start .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that apply to us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology artists such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to reveal iniquity . it is just as important as we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about abnorm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers with humble and covered hospitals . or the next environmental protection workers , the alarm on contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider , warned us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only done for those who want to cover crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest dat@@ le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; this week we were hosted by news about a l@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama .
the release of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like mosquito fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s correspondence with tax hav@@ ens have in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion U.S. dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin goes through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot richer people out there and others , which are nervous to wait for the next release , and to the next unveiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a agency &apos;s name or a John @-@ gr@@ ot@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations have been phenomenal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ de their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people all over the world seem very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ b .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these bi@@ dding .
it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States .
probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
could we have a dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples to have ties to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to start a firm as to get a reference ID .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school@@ lo@@ dges to le@@ gam@@ ble children .
it does not allow frau@@ ds to cause particularly severe investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all of this in practice looks like .
how does that work ?
so , we have sent a co@@ vert investig@@ ators in the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave to an African Minister , who wanted to bring out money to the U.S. to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked that all went up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator suggestions , how he could transfer his money .
these were all preliminary meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one has passed it to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who submitted suggestions in our co@@ vert investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single leading force policy , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very dull as if we could do anything about it , as if nothing ever changed , as if it will ever give the rich and powerful .
but as safe optim@@ ism , I do not see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen proposals towards more transparency , as concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU is recorded in central reg@@ isters at a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in business that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to commit themselves to ending through laws this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the transparency , which is now possible to finish this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red tap would have landed .
one day after I finished my design study , I made a back @-@ step sale .
a type in the red Mac@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip whole country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep for now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &apos; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
must I now offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him . he said he would go to Peace Cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a ma@@ iler !
this is a small suitcase !
then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said one voice in my head : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I hur@@ ried to the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh Mann ! what did I get there ?
a wild es@@ tran@@ che sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , p@@ umped on toe tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me today depends in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends , who just waiting to be discovered ?
to accomo@@ date people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am busy , almost bank@@ rupt , my co @-@ mate is drawn up and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I picked out how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WiFi and a desk including , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ i@@ tish guests were allowed to sleep in the air mattress for 20 dollars on a wooden floors .
they found it great , and we also .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham o@@ mel@@ ts tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all through the city . when we passed to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , started Brian and I .
had we just discovered that we could also find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came to the roll .
my former fellow , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could create a business concept .
thus we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people will post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of room whose doors are one when visiting .
over the Internet they can then invite wild@@ ly people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
indeed , they are not .
nobody , who is still at comfort , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have a problem , you get up to the things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design too , between people who never met before .
can design pay something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a treasure , what degree of confidence we strive to be .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your chest .
Th@@ umbs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ restricted mobile phone with your left seat .
this quietly approach of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts do when they open the first time the door .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only once , who has actually Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you proc@@ laim to Twitter that he serves the president for the president of the president ?
you can now back the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build on . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented with his name ; if he would have told what he would like , how his dog or his children be called ?
imagine , you could have 150 beats that all say : &quot; he can really stick very well @-@ down cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ out feedback system strengthens the confidence decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to submit negative evaluations .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their jud@@ g@@ ments before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depends on how similar they are with regard to age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most like we are most like .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgment departments .
if one has less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation com@@ mon@@ alities out .
thus , the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you expect from themselves .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little like &quot; hi ! &quot; you do not get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell you how , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ olle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works of your dwelling ! I make my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices of foreigners .
what we had not reck@@ oned was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
secondly : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need which had not been covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have v@@ ested parties celebrated or homes devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
in the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one he@@ ars in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue driving us .
fortunately , a fraction of the 123 million booked nights had only a fraction of the problem .
because people trusted each other to justice .
when trust works , it can be mir@@ ac@@ ulous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to be heart attack due to sitting positions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and has enough hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that can save life even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
you drive to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a byp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can even leave a longer without charge without extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course it does not run every time .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I wondered :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
but it is now simply to call the &quot; rented industry &quot; the thing is not justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people make a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is fast to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and to show a bar craw@@ l district which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
these days apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the room@@ mates ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities were taking the thought of a mutual share ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places belonged to the government ,
number of inhabitants were offered . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were deduc@@ ted . there were incub@@ ators programs ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . our platform alone will be guests of 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries by visiting a stranger , or even hosts .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it taught us .
we have not invented the wheel new .
hospitality was also before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from luck and timing , we know that you can find the right design with the components of the trust .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to contem@@ plate each time when a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a faithful one ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ pressed , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably people do not talk to their competitors .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- dou@@ bling es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ ery @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics in ,
and I am a practi@@ sing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten my decision .
no , not as a homo@@ sexual person , like some of my friends , but as mus@@ lim@@ ine . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you put yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in comparison with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to suit me a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only believed in the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought after , turned in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the past .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I perceive myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began just like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had to finish up , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ der@@ eg@@ istration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , flo@@ cks in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into ou@@ trage quickly .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... I switched to the TV channel and heard &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Infin@@ ite ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my god .
it was not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u related me the deeds of others from a civil society into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go to a new city and start building study .
I remember as I swe@@ eping -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be vigil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; silk &quot; in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Ex@@ vel@@ ed you do not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for prayer .
and again the warnings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that one held for Muslims living outdoors .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought , we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have fl@@ atten@@ ed the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against any questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we rid them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban@@ ish and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it only puts the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a vi@@ cious tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our , only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hei@@ fers , and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America secure ?
there may be perhaps a few parking spaces free , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit to a mosque leads to a people of other faith tolerant and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , men are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one noticed that it starts from their church , even by their family , that the extre@@ mes will make a brain washing , that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
when M@@ lim@@ ine , as a man , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology for their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one throws a glance on them , it is not driving them in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in the scriptures .
a outstanding Ima@@ m talked to me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her silence and said to her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring her only in trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing inspir@@ es and something that had given to their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alisation of extremis@@ ts who answered a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ima@@ m introduced the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
it was a glimpse of how the Islam@@ ophobia lead me and my family .
but how does it affect regular Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- in fact , several neurological studies -- show : when we fear , we pass at least three things .
we accept rather an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudices .
a study reveals : if people have reported reviews , in which negative about Muslims was reported negative attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only a academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims began up -- between 2001 and 2013 , this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ run of the Iraq war and during two election perio@@ dically .
thus , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to fold the foundation of free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear shifted us all .
when transferring collective inno@@ c@@ ence it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was on the dental Fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , the most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my bro@@ therhood ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister from Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was visited in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as with a execution after he posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he was eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also be fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we bes@@ ought it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely use our religion .
we decided to the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s office we moved to the mosque , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , went out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , as half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , ath@@ e@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to take care of us .
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion against panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go to number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say about those who might say you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk to work a den@@ ker@@ in with a drau@@ ght , therefore an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not fool you . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at Muslims around the world and I did that with the greatest ever done study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion international business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial Dro@@ ps . possible , this is done in research facilities worldwide .
before air par@@ c@@ issu@@ ance into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aviation machines in the Fra@@ c Centre has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks around the audience . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting together , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in narro@@ west room .
you can also build autonom@@ ously and hard @-@ wearing structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
thus a system of aut@@ on@@ om works , it does have to know collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the swift development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a offsprings of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands exist at the highest level . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane , that tries to beat two flies with a cap .
like other ri@@ ppers , it is efficient in advance @-@ looking efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ ators , it can float , and has a lot of advantages in the start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a limitation of cont@@ agi@@ ous nuts is that they respond sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air conditioner will not be able to regain the optimum position and the performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often ask fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mov@@ ables for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , who are combined to hurt you .
decades ago out @-@ driven pilots could fly remot@@ ely controlled air @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear @-@ ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ est , the mechan@@ ically simplest air @-@ operated air device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hin@@ ders and cross @-@ ru@@ bs , no further actu@@ ator or controls , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room to move over .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the odds of getting it right , when all watch it is small , I am showing you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the monster is a exercise in enjoyment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ants , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
in this way , he will receive the proper ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ate .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ ell@@ ites .
some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly from flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when they are to be part of our daily routine , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate branches of two @-@ prop@@ eller planes .
this revol@@ ves in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but it &apos;s something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited .
we will now demonstrate that by doing half the air@@ planes .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic s@@ warming .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there is Broadway would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
naturally , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wages in the development and the creation act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever things to form them in so spectacular ways .
the fact that this technology has such solid and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1.3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy two black holes ever faster , they turned so the mass Tri@@ ple Other in a tenth of the second @-@ dimensional in pure energy .
for this short moment , they turned out brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they do not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was handed into the space @-@ time fabric , and the universe explo@@ ded in the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events initially .
1.3 billion years ago there has been a multi @-@ camp life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rian , men and -- God stand with us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group was especially courageous - R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to build a giant laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise for example by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them stopped them crazy .
but enough people realized them as a mad gen@@ ies , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ om@@ eters - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could considerably increase , resulting in terms of recognition .
therefore , one therefore calls him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
in early September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller , stubborn problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting of my mortal sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all this , for what I had worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ists at the MIT . he studies for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories such as L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ ck@@ le in the fabric of space and time .
by passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction , and into the other .
to illustrate , instruc@@ tors in courses on the Rel@@ ativity Theory are often a true dance .
&quot; stretch and per@@ for@@ ages , stretch and eng@@ ages . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched out by meeting the waves and star@@ ving . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one explained the L@@ IG@@ O employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a atomic nucleus exactly . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity .
description Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder IG@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ c@@ ists are resour@@ ce@@ ful and will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
return to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott has claims like L@@ IG@@ O is more of a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : face lifts , the size of your mobile phone .
that &apos;s quite handy . because so you can create an image or a map of things by accepting the light around you from several points .
with tones , that is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wave @-@ length of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that will give you a lot of things to you :
the face of your child about .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as sound base and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now is talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert wavel@@ eng@@ patterns in tune , we can literally hear the universe literally .
the gravity for listening , I can reveal something about the collision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
S@@ H : two black , not three @-@ way holes , are simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , one he@@ ars the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of type of movement , engra@@ ved into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I have never forgotten - heard L@@ IG@@ O said : &#91; Sur@@ render of the noise &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what he must listen , recognizes this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun @-@ mass that revol@@ ve around as quickly as the rods of your bl@@ ender .
AA : let &apos;s consider ourselves briefly what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ gest body in space , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 Son@@ nen , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces in front of you .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
that is the constant meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O lays out a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to All listening and the invisible .
much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not see .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ br@@ asser@@ che stars in super @-@ nov@@ as explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about this from them .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the pri@@ mor@@ dial is covered by its own night@@ ing@@ lights .
with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly : I &apos;m optimistic that all things we have never seen before , which we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea of things . things that we just discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found equally in the first attempt of things that we did not expect .
my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like L@@ IG@@ O , are the dinosau@@ rs of the Universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ ice for our arche@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different angle on the events of space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors , and cle@@ ars the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , put me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just to do that before I feared , remove my fear .
my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that my life deeply changed , on an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it all started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; score , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I need milk for my beak @-@ tre@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them whenever you call me up . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I commend myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently , I really didn &apos;t understand that the &quot; yes &quot; seeds came to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a car . I think things out , go out to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ole television . I quote TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program features hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV broadcast@@ er can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days in four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes , three episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run on Thursday night on Thursday night .
around the world , my series in 256 parts run in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself and not only produced , so still ob@@ scene . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
nobody , therefore , am I a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to impress you accordingly .
I say it , because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who work so hard , if you now take a firm , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I talk about work so you understand that I don &apos;t just move on the computer and fanta@@ sies , and it is true , when I say , I understand that it is not by a dre@@ amer of dreams .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- not tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am plung@@ ed into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it &apos;s when I set up troops , when I found troops on a canvas .
for example , one ben@@ evol@@ ves a high tone , lying a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , lab@@ orious and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , gru@@ es@@ ome and rational , and the best thing about it is the buzz .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a buzz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz of money sounds like a busy road , I could go to it forever .
many people pick up , when I declare them the buzz that I am writing , that writing is joy to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the buzz -- when I began working with the TV production , when I began working and working and working , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this matter , this buzz , this energy . the buzz !
the sums are more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz of God is the voice in my ear .
and if you have so a money , you can not strive to be different from your size .
the feeling of being unable to move than to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is about ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums .
I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear picture : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things the same time , the more I write me , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the country I ran , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz .
I like this sums . I love the money .
I need the money . I am the sums .
am I just this buzz ?
and then it stopped the buzz .
revised , over@@ crowded , exaggerated , hidden .
the sums stop .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single work@@ tan .
Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; estim@@ ony , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
they are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were listening .
the buzz of the engine was du@@ um@@ med .
I did not love my job any more . the engine was out of charge .
the sums did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , searched weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
however , there was no money .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sums it was .
so what do you do , if that , what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some people think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you out , stupid author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you are doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ kers to be a mother , a mother who knows the sums , and knows how the sums it feels when you knew the sums , if the sums stops , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart he@@ ars , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; Ask me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , magical you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say NO , as I can become aware of two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they did not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone any more . &quot;
when is that happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my buzz , and here everything will change before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and her sisters meet , we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &apos; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &apos; .
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of the sw@@ a@@ thing , I can do nothing but to match .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I sh@@ out , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ ders and song in which it is about to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The I@@ k@@ gin &quot; will release .
everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes down and an energy boost is coming in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the buzz goes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is soft , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but an sums .
and now I feel like I would know a magic secret .
but let us stay with the cause .
it is Love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working environment , the tit@@ anium en@@ um , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself sti@@ ff of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are .
the buzz is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums of money depends on the love .
the buzz is the electricity that comes from the lust .
the real sums of money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of the story , the pre@@ per@@ ting tasks , the expectation and the printing .
the real sums of money is simple and original .
the real sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ pered the false words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not just like working together .
the truth does hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am always working , because I love it .
I prefer at work as well as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a person is working rather than being home ?
well , yes , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of them .
we get around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we fl@@ aming soap bub@@ bles .
but I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I am always based on my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with the games ?
you can also ! say , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my babies want to play with me at most 15 minutes and take up them up to them that they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I will replace a puppy or Ke@@ eper .
and speak my teen@@ ie daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more do not need .
everyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on piece !
no mobile , no clothes , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids ready to do .
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to feel the sums , a place for his soul &apos;s peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
to the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find it out and keep it up .
I am not perfect in it . I am ashamed and I will conquer . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; just like everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan at school when I wanted to out@@ do more and learn more .
15 minutes on the slice , why not get full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown tune , she fills me and my soul . she leads me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sums , but I do not love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the buzz of money is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sums .
the sums of life .
the buzz of Love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just one part . and for that I am so thankful .
it is spar@@ ing me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country I sh@@ out , the marathon , I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , subtle , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel the amount of the sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a car . I think things out , I love you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have an ab@@ iding , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was surg@@ ically surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
for sure , they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; low@@ ho@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; in this case , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons of neur@@ ons so that neurological function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered under fierce tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was managing director and worked on the emergency day and night .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trauma .
you must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain swi@@ ms and the skull @-@ pressure is mounting .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull @-@ pressure on the skull .
for this you sometimes need to remove a part of the cotton mass .
instead of throwing the frau@@ dul@@ ent brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not an easy task .
let cells grow from a gun post is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environment in order to flour@@ ish .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw this among his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you may still know from the sex@@ ology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of body .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells dealt differently .
they slowly spread slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different differently .
we needed a long way to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ eling cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
so we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as well as Jean François Hollande
and they subsequently highlight color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we planted them at the disposal of the same individual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ transp@@ l@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ tin@@ ent these cells into a normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in the in@@ tim@@ ed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks it disappeared completely , as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we had an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we colored in vit@@ ro , in the culture of coloring .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so , we employ monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very well .
as they achieved a stable noise level , we injured the hand in motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hands anymore .
just as it would happen to people recovered , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural in@@ doctr@@ in@@ eries . they recover at a certain level , just as in the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side they see the monkeys that will recover spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , as we see the cells re@@ im@@ planted : the same ape , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that we have been very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them from freezing and later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms , in order to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : that is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time to have a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trial . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the clinical trial application .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it &apos;s useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society .
we tend to look at them as inv@@ ari@@ able ent@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ itation in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is overcome with us , in Europe .
earlier this year , when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambiguous with me as Minister of Finance Ministers in the Euro@@ group - our choices -- not influ@@ encing the austerity Programme which were implemented in Greece .
in this moment I thought it might not be a better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ declared friends , who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished when it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of any errors , we could save democracy , but that we need a perceived and def@@ ective democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies are restrained , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that threatens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paradox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who throws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the debt mountain ,
yet few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who are too anxious , where it would be productive and income , with which one could contribute to the debt mountain , and also produce all the things that humanity needs strongly , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in all the well @-@ being producing estates , such as industrial installations , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars is coming to a lot of money , until they compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which are around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except to infl@@ ate the stock and the property prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 years old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low demand feared to promote this themselves in which they do not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus father , who from fear , the prophecy of o@@ ra@@ un@@ cle could be true that his son would kill him when he grows .
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances bring about , which cause o@@ sts to kill him .
this is my ha@@ sty with capitalism --
his extremely wasted capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to fund particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the social form , in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the ath@@ ic democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of ath@@ ic democracy due to these exclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it was the working poor , not only the right to freedom of expression , but also more important and crucial that has given them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal votes in questions of the state of state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not long held ath@@ ic democracy --
as a candle , which lit very bright , she is also burned out quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our present liberal democracies not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was by stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a full separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , whereas the economy -- the world of corporations -- is a democratic free zone .
in our present democracies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two in which the economy gradually emig@@ rated between the two by the economy gradually falling into politics .
wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because today it can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ p with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about just like a flock of predat@@ ors , causing so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving in the end .
it is similar to the economy which has paraly@@ zed the policy so far , that it grows through the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations growing , political goods are being de@@ valu@@ ated , the economic demand falls , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their firms .
the more successful the capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy the higher the twin summit , and the greater the extravag@@ ance of human labour power and wealth of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control reserves , like in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had taken this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t look very well .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor create !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ electric shock through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ate automation can be higher , the wast@@ age , and the social conflicts are deeper , as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics and to ensure that we will address the re@@ unified area of democracy , otherwise we end in an abnormal surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which it has produced , will survive .
the interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks with the meaning of life .
I believe we may be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what do it mean , how could it look like this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of having a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the company of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place , from a company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , all incomes come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not belong in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and spar@@ es , and ultimately no up@@ swing of twin summit .
in the realm of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that all world trade in this currency will be tra@@ ded -- and we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade of the respective country into a joint fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to realise it .
today we have it , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world which I describe you is at the same time liber@@ als , in which they preferred to be privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ isch , global Key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ isch .
but above all it is a world where we can visu@@ alize real democracy .
will we watch in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to act together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do not do this , the technological development will generate such a massive decline of economic demand , as Lar@@ ry sum@@ mons is referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is definitely relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am absolutely un@@ ra@@ vel .
BG : actually , and now we are probably also .
Y@@ V : if you are not hosting , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture given Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics during the sphere where most of the economy is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a sense when I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative say , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical of what concerns the democratic development .
what one can observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells amazing after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I am sure many list@@ ener were curious about their experience as Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I was framed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , from self @-@ suffici@@ ency and the perpet@@ ual denial that a massive devast@@ ation line was passed through the euro zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatening the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the incidentally , who was the first proposal that revealed this denial --
it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism in life , one might delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens to be ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone , who looks back -- seriousness t ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims he did not make any mistakes , then that is a dangerous person .
naturally , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to submit the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the don@@ or of the don@@ or to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring out our government , just because they did not want to deal with the assessments which ran through the eurozone .
they did not want to admit that she had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
that is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika creditors yet imposed on these policies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not out@@ lived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they did not survive , they will be susp@@ icious and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of the people have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is head instructor at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a yel@@ low@@ ish and describes on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content across Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy did not choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this corner .
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating dates from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this one will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addic@@ tive , where , after you looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting into the left side of the curve , because I think you need specific intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does more thoughts on the average yield , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not enthusiastic .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon so doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he considers a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and el@@ ects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where they can see everyone at no cost .
and if Amazon gives free things , you can attack , right ?
millions of spectators are looking at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they will be observed while watching this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are taking everything .
you realize when you start the show when you inst@@ ate , which parts you ski@@ ps or check once again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many people don &apos;t remember this show because they were not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha House would lands at 7.5 -- something over the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for finding these a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data via the Net@@ fli@@ x @-@ viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors are .
when they had together all the parts , they went a vehicle and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data rever@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what lies that ?
because logic was somehow silent , that it should work in everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good choice .
there are 200 years on statistics than back @-@ up .
you work it through very powerful computers .
the least thing that you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis did not work so this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we reach more and more of stat@@ s to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
nobody . ok , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if anyone is in prison here and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show is good or bad , will be decided if a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always produce the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of irreversible firms are even wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the rou@@ gh@@ est way , you can say -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year after year , until it suddenly wasn &apos;t working ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the resistance of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data for diversi@@ fying companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes the data gets deeper into decisions of life -- on the workplace , in the legal condition , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use lots of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , do basically do two things :
as a first , solve this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as cement , you put the items back together in order to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take them apart and come together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to de@@ generate a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to sit down , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision - especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of . but deciding how to take all of these parts again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used the data to control all their choices first as they we@@ ds TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what we say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; -- &quot; right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will make it later on with a Techni@@ k@@ demo .
so far I made some decisions made in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more cl@@ oned , such as data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data still paying off , making decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
