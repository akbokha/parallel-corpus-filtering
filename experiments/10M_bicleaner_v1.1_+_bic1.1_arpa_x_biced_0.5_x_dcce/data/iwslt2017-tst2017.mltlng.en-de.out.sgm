<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize to the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, wrote Risen's book in which he was spectacular published that the NSA intercepted illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter that should give a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA has literally drafts Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapters did not exist?</seg>
<seg id="9">The American government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against rage and urged him to call its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">He became a symbol of the symbol for the design of the government, whistleblowers and to punching journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional exchange, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if they can not protect identity of the mute they cost.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government near Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, Risen from 2007 to 2015 lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though it would be for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and the sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of going to fail and bring rhisen to statements, this could also cause his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, are concerned with his telephone,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit card, and even travel-wise with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistle-blowers and risens of alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers by his appearance, but instead the judiciary has more condemned more than any US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government moves too much from their work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of an whistle-blowers going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the line that is to be protected by the first constitutional exchange because the government has more and more possibilities to expose all of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And that they may take it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not been written when writing his book had written, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmitter system for whistleblowers, originally developed from the internet-famous, developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, during which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, as with each ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer steer information secretly, and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that apply to us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to ensure that not only technology artists such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to reveal iniquity. it is just as important as we protect the next whistleblowers." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers with humble and covered hospitals. or the next environmental protection workers, the alarm on contaminated water from Flint suggests. or a Wallstreet insider, warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only done for those who want to cover crime but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest datleck of history has been published.] [we bade Robert Palmer from Global Witness for a statement.] this week we were hosted by news about a leck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The release of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like mosquito fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's correspondence with tax havens have in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion U.S. dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin goes through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot richer people out there and others, which are nervous to wait for the next release, and to the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agency's name or a John-grotham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations have been phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret havens are used by a few of them to hide and concede their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people all over the world seem very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapub.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these bidding.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Could we have a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples to have ties to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to start a firm as to get a reference ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of schoollodges to legamble children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not allow frauds to cause particularly severe investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all of this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we have sent a covert investigators in the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave to an African Minister, who wanted to bring out money to the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all went up to a lawyer of our investigator suggestions, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preliminary meetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one has passed it to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who submitted suggestions in our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leading force policy, wrapped up in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull as if we could do anything about it, as if nothing ever changed, as if it will ever give the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as safe optimism, I do not see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen proposals towards more transparency, as concerns the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is recorded in central registers at a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headings.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in business that arise and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to commit themselves to ending through laws this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the transparency, which is now possible to finish this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red tap would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I made a back-step sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Macda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip whole country. after that he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep for now?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, 'Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Must I now offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him. he said he would go to Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a mailer!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small suitcase!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying, "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "said one voice in my head:" "" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I hurried to the ceiling and thought, "Oh Mann! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild estranche sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, pumped on toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me today depends in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accomodate people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am busy, almost bankrupt, my co-mate is drawn up and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I picked out how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WiFi and a desk including, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happitish guests were allowed to sleep in the air mattress for 20 dollars on a wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelts tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all through the city. when we passed to our last guest and the door to the castle fell, started Brian and I.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could also find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could create a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented our Investors: "we would like to create a website where people will post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of room whose doors are one when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite wildly people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still at comfort, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"" "" "" "because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous." ""</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you get up to the things that you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design too, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design pay something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a treasure, what degree of confidence we strive to be.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your chest.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unrestricted mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approach of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts do when they open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who has actually Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim to Twitter that he serves the president for the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now back the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build on. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first presented with his name; if he would have told what he would like, how his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you could have 150 beats that all say: "he can really stick very well-down cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-out feedback system strengthens the confidence decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to submit negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their judgments before we placed them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depends on how similar they are with regard to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most like we are most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgment departments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation commonalities out.</seg>
<seg id="185">Thus, the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you expect from themselves.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little like "hi!" you do not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell you how, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "" "" Tolle "" "" works of your dwelling! I make my family holiday. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices of foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have vested parties celebrated or homes devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">In the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue driving us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, a fraction of the 123 million booked nights had only a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can be miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to be heart attack due to sitting positions." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and has enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that can save life even though they don't know it properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even leave a longer without charge without extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course it does not run every time.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I wondered:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now simply to call the "rented industry" the thing is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People make a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is fast to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and to show a bar crawl district which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">These days apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the roommates?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were taking the thought of a mutual share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Number of inhabitants were offered. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were deducted. there were incubators programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. our platform alone will be guests of 785 000 people in 191 countries by visiting a stranger, or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel new.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we know that you can find the right design with the components of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to contemplate each time when a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful one? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people do not talk to their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- doubling espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchery-Fitness-fanatics in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practising, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen my decision.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as muslimine. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head covering.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you put yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in comparison with the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to suit me a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed in the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, turned in question, doubted and believed in the past.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender which deepened with each reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I perceive myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began just like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I was sitting in my kitchen, had to finish up, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "Eilderegistration" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, flocks in buildings, people spranged from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into outrage quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... I switched to the TV channel and heard "" "..." Muslim terrorists "" "..." "" "... in the name of Islam" ""... "..." ""... "Infinite..." ""... "" ""... "bombed Mecca!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my god.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country attacked, but in the Nu related me the deeds of others from a civil society into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go to a new city and start building study.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as I sweeping -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said, "Be vigilant," "silk" in well-lighted areas, "" Exveled you do not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that one held for Muslims living outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought, we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have flattened the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we rid them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to banish and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only puts the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a vicious tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour, only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, heifers, and Olympionians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be perhaps a few parking spaces free, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to a people of other faith tolerant and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, men are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one noticed that it starts from their church, even by their family, that the extremes will make a brain washing, that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Mlimine, as a man, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology for their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one throws a glance on them, it is not driving them in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A outstanding Imam talked to me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her silence and said to her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring her only in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "nothing inspires and something that had given to their anger, it was a main objective for the instrumentalisation of extremists who answered a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam introduced the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia lead me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect regular Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- in fact, several neurological studies -- show: when we fear, we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if people have reported reviews, in which negative about Muslims was reported negative attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims began up -- between 2001 and 2013, this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-run of the Iraq war and during two election periodically.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "there can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to fold the foundation of free society, the rational and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear shifted us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When transferring collective innocence it is not just about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental Faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, the most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brotherhood?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister from Yusor, Razan, which was visited in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as with a execution after he posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He was eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral, but also be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We besought it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely use our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's office we moved to the mosque, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, went out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to take care of us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion against panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choosing at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go to number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say about those who might say you have a TEDTalk to work a denkerin with a draught, therefore an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not fool you. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at Muslims around the world and I did that with the greatest ever done study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion international business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial Drops. possible, this is done in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcissuance into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aviation machines in the Frac Centre has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks around the audience. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting together, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in narrowest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build autonomously and hard-wearing structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus a system of autonom works, it does have to know collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the swift development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands exist at the highest level. for example, "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, that tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other rippers, it is efficient in advance-looking efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrators, it can float, and has a lot of advantages in the start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of contagious nuts is that they respond sensitive to turbulence like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the air conditioner will not be able to regain the optimum position and the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movables for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, who are combined to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago out-driven pilots could fly remotely controlled air-controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a rear-rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monest, the mechanically simplest air-operated air device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinders and cross-rubs, no further actuator or controls, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room to move over.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The odds of getting it right, when all watch it is small, I am showing you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monster is a exercise in enjoyment, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellants, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way, he will receive the proper ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rotate.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Propellites.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly from flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When they are to be part of our daily routine, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate branches of two-propeller planes.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But it's something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by doing half the airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there is Broadway would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Naturally, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wages in the development and the creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever things to form them in so spectacular ways.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such solid and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago circled in a very far distant galaxy two black holes ever faster, they turned so the mass Triple Other in a tenth of the second-dimensional in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they turned out brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they do not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was handed into the space-time fabric, and the universe exploded in the gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events initially.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there has been a multi-camp life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought some things: corals, fish, plants, saurian, men and -- God stand with us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group was especially courageous - Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise for example by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized them as a mad genies, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometers - gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO could considerably increase, resulting in terms of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, one therefore calls him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my mortal sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, for what I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at the MIT. he studies for 23 years of gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crockle in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction, and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, instructors in courses on the Relativity Theory are often a true dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and perforages, stretch and engages."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched out by meeting the waves and starving. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, one explained the LIGO employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of a atomic nucleus exactly. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity.</seg>
<seg id="502">Description Kip Thorne, a co-founder IGIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are resourceful and will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Return to LIGO. Scott has claims like LIGO is more of a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: face lifts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite handy. because so you can create an image or a map of things by accepting the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wave-length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that will give you a lot of things to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as sound base and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now is talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"swimmers Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wavelengpatterns in tune, we can literally hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity for listening, I can reveal something about the collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not three-way holes, are simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same circus with an additional sound change. it sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of type of movement, engraved into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I have never forgotten - heard LIGO said: [Surrender of the noise] Jemand, who knows what he must listen, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun-mass that revolve around as quickly as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider ourselves briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the digest body in space, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen, circling a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces in front of you.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">That is the constant meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO lays out a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to All listening and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mbrasserche stars in super-novas explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about this from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the primordial is covered by its own nightinglights.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I'm optimistic that all things we have never seen before, which we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea of things. things that we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equally in the first attempt of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague am MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the sauerknoice for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different angle on the events of space, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors, and clears the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, put me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just to do that before I feared, remove my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that my life deeply changed, on an unexpectedly. it all started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "score,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "estimate, I need milk for my beak-treach." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swear to play with them whenever you call me up. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I commend myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently, I really didn't understand that the "yes" seeds came to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a car. I think things out, go out to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creole television. I quote TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program features hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcaster can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days in four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes, three episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run on Thursday night on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series in 256 parts run in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created myself and not only produced, so still obscene. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore, am I a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work so hard, if you now take a firm, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I talk about work so you understand that I don't just move on the computer and fantasies, and it is true, when I say, I understand that it is not by a dreamer of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- not tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am plunged into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I set up troops, when I found troops on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">For example, one benevolves a high tone, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, laborious and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, gruesome and rational, and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz of money sounds like a busy road, I could go to it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people pick up, when I declare them the buzz that I am writing, that writing is joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working with the TV production, when I began working and working and working, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this matter, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz of God is the voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so a money, you can not strive to be different from your size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being unable to move than to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is about ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear picture: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things the same time, the more I write me, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I ran, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the money.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the money. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stopped the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overcrowded, exaggerated, hidden.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single worktan.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people, "My mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "estimony, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were listening.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was duummed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job any more. the engine was out of charge.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, searched weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">However, there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an indication-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums it was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some people think:" "" "hay you out, stupid author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you are doing what you're doing to be a teacher, a bankers to be a mother, a mother who knows the sums, and knows how the sums it feels when you knew the sums, if the sums stops, who is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" Ask me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, magical you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say NO, as I can become aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they did not" "" "estimony" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone any more. "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz, and here everything will change before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters meet, we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book 'Everybody Poops'.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of the swathing, I can do nothing but to match.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I shout, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, waders and song in which it is about to release, or whatever the girl in "The Ikgin" will release.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes down and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz goes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is soft, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but an sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium enum, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself stiff of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums of money depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the electricity that comes from the lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums of money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignoring the pressure of the story, the preperting tasks, the expectation and the printing.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums of money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered the false words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not just like working together.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work as well as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what a person is working rather than being home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We get around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We flaming soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">But I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always based on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me for naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My babies want to play with me at most 15 minutes and take up them up to them that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I will replace a puppy or Keeper.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenie daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more do not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can catch 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids ready to do.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">"" "" "" "my children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums, a place for his soul's peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I am ashamed and I will conquer. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" just like everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan at school when I wanted to outdo more and learn more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the slice, why not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown tune, she fills me and my soul. she leads me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the buzz of money is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and for that I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is sparing me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I shout, the marathon, I run, the troops, the canvases, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, subtle, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel the amount of the sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a car. I think things out, I love you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and to play more games.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have an abiding, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was surgically surgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure, they have heard of one of the most famous, the "lowhoirnstimulation." in this case, one implanted a electrode deeply in the brain to influence the neurons of neurons so that neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered under fierce trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was managing director and worked on the emergency day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that in skull-brain traumas the brain swims and the skull-pressure is mounting.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull-pressure on the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes need to remove a part of the cotton mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the fraudulent brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells grow from a gun post is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environment in order to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this among his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you may still know from the sexology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of body.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells dealt differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, weird cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long way to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandhireling cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">So we had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as well as Jean François Hollande</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we planted them at the disposal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">"" "we call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotrantransplant." ""</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we retinent these cells into a normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have reimplanted the same cells in the intimed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks it disappeared completely, as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we had an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we colored in vitro, in the culture of coloring.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we employ monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable noise level, we injured the hand in motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hands anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people recovered, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of sculptural indoctrineries. they recover at a certain level, just as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side they see the monkeys that will recover spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, as we see the cells reimplanted: the same ape, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we have been very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them from freezing and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time to have a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trial. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the clinical trial application.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it's useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventories of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as invariable entness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitation in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is overcome with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">Earlier this year, when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous with me as Minister of Finance Ministers in the Eurogroup - our choices -- not influencing the austerity Programme which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought it might not be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my undeclared friends, who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished when it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of any errors, we could save democracy, but that we need a perceived and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy, our societies are restrained, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">To the subject of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin" "" "paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who are too anxious, where it would be productive and income, with which one could contribute to the debt mountain, and also produce all the things that humanity needs strongly, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the euro area, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the well-being producing estates, such as industrial installations, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars is coming to a lot of money, until they compare it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which are around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except to inflate the stock and the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be equalled by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 years old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low demand feared to promote this themselves in which they do not invest. just like Oedipus father, who from fear, the prophecy of orauncle could be true that his son would kill him when he grows.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances bring about, which cause osts to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hasty with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasted capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and to fund particularly all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of athic democracy due to these exclusion.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decision on the athic democracy was and is that it was the working poor, not only the right to freedom of expression, but also more important and crucial that has given them the right to political co-determination with equal votes in questions of the state of state." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">It has not long held athic democracy --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle, which lit very bright, she is also burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our present liberal democracies not have their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was by statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a full separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, whereas the economy -- the world of corporations -- is a democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two in which the economy gradually emigrated between the two by the economy gradually falling into politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hap with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about just like a flock of predators, causing so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, that they are starving in the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy which has paralyzed the policy so far, that it grows through the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations growing, political goods are being devaluated, the economic demand falls, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their firms.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful the capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] from democracy the higher the twin summit, and the greater the extravagance of human labour power and wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "control reserves, like in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had taken this idea 100 years ago and it didn't look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor create!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-electric shock through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automate automation can be higher, the wastage, and the social conflicts are deeper, as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics and to ensure that we will address the reunified area of democracy, otherwise we end in an abnormal surveillance hyperautocracy that leaves the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which it has produced, will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a Dystopia, similar to the "matrix," in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athenians, Agora, "in long talks with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what do it mean, how could it look like this" "" "star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of having a" "" "matrix" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place, from a company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "then, all incomes come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not belong in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and spares, and ultimately no upswing of twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the realm of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries] in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade in this currency will be traded -- and we call it "the cosmos" in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade of the respective country into a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to realise it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have it, especially in front of the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world which I describe you is at the same time liberals, in which they preferred to be privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and Keynesianisch, global Keynesianisch.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world where we can visualize real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we watch in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to act together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography yourself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and business is... Do not do this, the technological development will generate such a massive decline of economic demand, as Larry summons is referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is definitely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am absolutely unravel.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are probably also.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not hosting, you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it Einstein, who said. BG: in your lecture given Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy to politics during the sphere where most of the economy is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense when I may say that provocative say, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells amazing after hypocrisy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, from self-sufficiency and the perpetual denial that a massive devastation line was passed through the euro zone, and continues to be massively threatening the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the incidentally, who was the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one might delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens to be abrupt and destructive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of the people have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is head instructor at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a yellowish and describes on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content across Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy did not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating dates from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this one will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, addictive, where, after you looked at a season, your brain asks, "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddler and Tiaras" -- "-- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting into the left side of the curve, because I think you need specific intelligence to undermine" "" "Toddler and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He does more thoughts on the average yield, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not enthusiastic.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon so doing something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he considers a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where they can see everyone at no cost.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives free things, you can attack, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they will be observed while watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are taking everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You realize when you start the show when you instate, which parts you skips or check once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and resulting from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that many people don't remember this show because they were not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House would lands at 7.5 -- something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for finding these a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data via the Netflix-viewers, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors are.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a vehicle and decided not to make a Sitcom on four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," House of Cards "" "." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data reverfied companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What lies that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic was somehow silent, that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good choice.</seg>
<seg id="1086">There are 200 years on statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You work it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing that you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis did not work so this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we reach more and more of stats to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. ok, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a missal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show is good or bad, will be decided if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produce the best results. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of irreversible firms are even wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the roughest way, you can say -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year after year, until it suddenly wasn't working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the resistance of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data for diversifying companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes the data gets deeper into decisions of life -- on the workplace, in the legal condition, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use lots of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, do basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, solve this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as cement, you put the items back together in order to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take them apart and come together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to degenerate a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to sit down, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision - especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think I was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of. but deciding how to take all of these parts again and make a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used the data to control all their choices first as they weds TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "that's what we say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "there is also called" "" "Magic 8 ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" -- "right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it later on with a Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I made some decisions made in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more cloned, such as data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data still paying off, making decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
