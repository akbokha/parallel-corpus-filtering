Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that will change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a pit @-@ chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the suff@@ oc@@ ated cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .
it anno@@ ys when land@@ cards are not up to date .
this knows everyone who had to be exciting already because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i had a green meadow instead of a walk @-@ road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ o @-@ Portal ( Bavaria ) of the state government , are anything but current - but therefore very conclu@@ sive .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it is clear how cities and churches have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas which one recognizes as the same .
in the large coverage map were collected for cities and municipalities for more detailed cards , so @-@ called urine sheets .
these were created according to the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ mess@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pped the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders took part of Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even when the French troops finally reloc@@ ated to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were the neighbors today , which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ mess@@ ing administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ ti@@ lage form for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is as much as possible to find all the others on the website of the Bav@@ arian State Library .
the comparison table / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
Send@@ ling was divided 21 years after creation of the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower @-@ Spring are concentrated in 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at the Hin@@ doo omen , one petty @-@ click map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written Fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; urine recording , &quot; which the basic tax has been derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there today are no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ser of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land of Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green space is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Show@@ place of the October Revolution , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychi@@ atric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jungle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only about the street address &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tavern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the ascent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the au@@ er@@ field street you should once have been crow@@ ned with madness .
there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ beck . &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of this psychiatr@@ ist , who is being brought to King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the sho@@ ot@@ ation of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohi@@ bits the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition .
for 280 patients , first place had been fixed , later on 500 places were extended .
sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ kultur@@ anstalt made in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ li@@ um Munich @-@ East has been one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiatr@@ ists in Germany since 2006 .
the people of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt are now meeting people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth @-@ home with training establishments .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children @-@ house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in an architec@@ tur@@ istic approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as the main square , called the Pur@@ chase alley .
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies were torn in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
one big remained to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a pit @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages was once again at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn route take place .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the air @-@ image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
rights @-@ rights available for Mis@@ souri
the National Association zur Förderung der colored has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ souri due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , which will take place until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to leave their journeys by the state and have extreme caution , as a number of frag@@ mentary , racial @-@ based incidents can occur in recent times throughout the state and listed here , &quot; it says in the opinion of the group .
a recently passed law from Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to win discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportionate of minorities , prompted the group to release travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they are bre@@ aches of civil rights , which are going to happen .
they are pulled together because of their skin colour , they are collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such an incidence we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist battles against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ ander , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , having no gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri , without crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the office of the Secretary General of Mis@@ souri , which is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will be 75 per cent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ery money or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 Mis@@ souri recorded 100 hate crimes , following the latest figures from the hate criminal reporting programme of the F@@ BI , which took the state in relation to the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ation Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) made travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona , after the states conce@@ aled immigration laws to mis@@ trust people because of immigration violations , which , in view of AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further development .
travel openings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the primary project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ ical Women &apos;s Hospital is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided an impression on location .
during the T@@ wen@@ ched family of Sch@@ wen@@ demann met representatives from the Fis@@ her@@ bacher CD@@ U commune together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann gave insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and also many young animals , and in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este houses .
the &quot; black @-@ pet@@ ting milk &quot; is for him of an Alternative wir@@ ing way for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este exclusively region@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t manage up on such steep surfaces .
the green space care for a lot of work , much must be handled with the motor@@ sense .
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental factory and run this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it does not conduct a bio@@ economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e was clear to Mayor Thomas Schneider : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hect@@ are , the farmers need to be supported .
I hope that the for@@ estation of areas could be moved still quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure that we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding
in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure space is thus 40 hectares , which can not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euro , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter took place in the village of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus they res@@ ale the farmers 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women do not go . &quot;
even for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; here the best food products are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ es ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ country support of the Wei@@ de@@ ten@@ unen .
the aim is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
a requirement is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ drawn convey@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the surface area must not be disastrous ( H@@ ang@@ a@@ version over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the Fis@@ her@@ ical Ad@@ ult project 2018 , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers fence .
the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cost @-@ calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic ins@@ ax in a hit@@ ry dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of President on the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller is not turning the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ in@@ filtr@@ ators would have acted to it if he had done it .
but he attacked their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to , when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta described , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here for a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem which you refer to later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly accurate , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your exhausted , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who long for you to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not become involved in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict regarding the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that it took a high political action .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by demonstrating in an un@@ used classical imaging representation the feminine embodiment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in their poem , the feminine figure is no longer abstr@@ actions - she has received a voice .
and she herself gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and exactly like Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people of the right wing want to change it for a long time .
the great cry for the rush of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty Is not a one , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative that bring the American flame into the re@@ inst@@ ated world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something encountered .
the importance of the statue is entirely at all a question of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were from the exhausted , miserable , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible journeys on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to recognize .
her tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way but hate the hatred , who is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
World Championships 2017 : Neil Black Br@@ ack@@ able members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two car@@ rots were included in the United Kingdom &apos;s team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power @-@ director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent on the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; developed &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue until we find it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that something has to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athlete thinks it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ on@@ chart - who were to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m trail , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her surrender was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were stran@@ tically or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the genuine feeling the E@@ ili@@ m got quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver Med@@ al winning a winning player , which is competing at the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 notes are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total score at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year has put five British and two European records last year .
it will take to the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m running , is another Scottish , which one was able to observe the victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman was in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the Mann@@ it@@ ters surrender states that they are &quot; enormously &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and in the Fin@@ als .
&quot; to be special about team captain , is that it was a great honour from other members of the team , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and have chosen to make it very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am obviously very proud of all the str@@ els that are part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
and here they are the established athletes , athletes who want to get off po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy , as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion again .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it &apos;s gonna be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics about Facebook : throw yourself not a public office , if you cannot tolerate the inser@@ ts of the voters
the Father of our country knew something of poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers cla@@ ve him because of all , from home policy to his political principles .
he was ashamed of the criticism , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and word@@ less , we are led by the sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads me to Maryland to Governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s staff have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Defence Union def@@ endant him this week earlier this week .
the ne@@ ab governor made the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online @-@ comment had been full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is surprisingly popular .
he has the highest @-@ highest approval of the fifty govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ un@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of individuals who come to the Board of Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans speaker in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too easy to use the image of dry or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ance people who swing the wh@@ ip online .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
Law@@ gi@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was very polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary volume of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate that idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then they are dis@@ respected by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the govern@@ ors of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ pron@@ unciation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it simple to trim a message by simply blocks a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff has been sent to collect newspapers with critical notes and burn or to burn demonstrators and to bring silence .
but that is exactly what is happening digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who critici@@ zed that he imp@@ acted Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users , which were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as they represented a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
in time Washington &apos;s time had a similar impact on the Internet at an affordable port .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envelope to his leadership .
and even then , Washington was anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseudo @-@ me such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that Washington &apos;s decisions made .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the United Kingdom , came his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort because the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian is hosting the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which resulted in next year in Arch@@ er@@ field Links up to the end of Arch@@ er@@ field , before joining Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new au@@ Femin@@ ism and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reached its glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he placed this place .
he is a di@@ ligent suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for that course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British E@@ ales will be happy to defend a championship for the first time , even though he has won a European Challenge tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly interested , &quot; said the player found in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not defended the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , as it was in the year after I had won her out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
going back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour comes back to the action on the home page .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy how the set has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoke
less people died in the past two decades due to pas@@ si@@ vity of lung cancer .
these results come from the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer waste is attributed to pas@@ si@@ smoke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Studien@@ leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there have been more than 400 lung cancer medicines because of pas@@ si@@ vity per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ work turns out to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; reasonably close to time , &quot; said the Director of the Bau@@ de Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house@@ keeping , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the sub@@ soil much multip@@ ly , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which ham@@ pered the construction work again , represents a major problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and cur@@ few are already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ da@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p are employed for weeks with working on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina &apos;s De@@ ge@@ i cooks the dinner , they do not use a coo@@ ker .
they are used even rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the peac@@ eb@@ ind@@ ian Province of Papua , the house@@ keeper is usually called a sweet potato - locally than &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the coal was sk@@ im@@ ous with di@@ ligent , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay hall , she has no furniture - where she also carries her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ ch .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were assigned to her no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to catch around at 5 p.m. in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , who was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were raised in the occupation of occupation .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch domination , turned to the government of Jak@@ arta organised to control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitoring of it .
in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ fenced , and of cor@@ rug@@ ated ro@@ oft@@ ops which are transm@@ uted by cr@@ ust in different yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ en was a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of the population live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is situated only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a rural province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port has sold gold and copper in 2015 alone .
in addition , Papua with wood resources in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are however a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure the Indones@@ ian military have kept a sti@@ cking presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military personnel and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ al demands for greater autonomy threaten this Golden G@@ ans and will be mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ly treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists killed more than 500,000 Papua and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tor@@ tured and de@@ tained .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal chiefs in the 1970 @-@ 1980 years have been established in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee on the genocide .
in the region , the Indones@@ ian police in the region last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report by the Or@@ di@@ zz@@ esis Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atrocities and torture - rape and electro@@ pl@@ ings are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal rainf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as each week occurred , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ Explorer for Human Rights Watch .
bol@@ ts are strengthened , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources could get a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ inen @-@ sk@@ ed chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut .
local people fight for keeping up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local fantasy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital of P@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Papua - the m@@ amma @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in Pop@@ ular and as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign to tackle the inequalities and violations in Papua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann received 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation , that he will fulfil our hopes , that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low @-@ point only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ving in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the ro@@ cked children told them they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off in her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who drank , and sm@@ ote the group with their rif@@ le collaborators , said victims and witnesses .
then became one of the soldiers into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to hit that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building was set on the nearby government Commission and escal@@ ated things next day .
about 1,000 young Papua , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military commander in order to demand justice .
they bore a cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ sc@@ rup@@ ulous - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstrators began to tow stones at the police and post @-@ post office .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses pay more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of T@@ IME , which did not enter local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the elevated risk and called for rest and urged the amount to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the porch of his colourful be@@ m@@ old wooden house .
Kay@@ am still does not know who was fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the here gathered soldiers .
&quot; it was packed , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ eing .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears as many Indones@@ ians only one name , the T@@ IME in gri@@ mmer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station , &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others have been injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings first came in the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks held J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ ath the historical griev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he establishes an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for the ref@@ utation of historical violations of human rights .
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most violations occur a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat than he spoke and said on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME , and said he did not have any plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
ed@@ anto , which was indicted by the UN for crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights violations have been laid down in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I was interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten from the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; having buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; says he .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the village residents and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a mind @-@ less man into hospital , a person died and 17 others have been injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was her@@ ical , when he conf@@ is@@ cated in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
recorded villagers prot@@ ested in front of the sit@@ ing office of the company .
the police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who re@@ acted on them re@@ acted by warning shots .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured one has been supplied here quickly , so the T@@ IME .
&quot; I have hidden myself in my house two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a ru@@ h@@ ote for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensual development rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green Highlands of Papua .
many of the &quot; Free Movement Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ ic army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing the spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people have been arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pretext of securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Papua ( Pan@@ i@@ ai ) is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten site . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and vegetables and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who are able to edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a co@@ hosted only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ia ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic inequalities between the domestic Papua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers have arrived .
the few jobs that are available in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to keep their own enterprises competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation considers the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media are tense .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the correspon@@ den@@ ces of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia of un@@ troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March the six paci@@ fist states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian State Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r referred to the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , May@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say they will probably not be right for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Gu@@ ards , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory army , who is engaged in arm@@ our education and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , have to look at her voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation of families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai kno@@ ck@@ les , a final symbolic act of the holding has been buried in an area closely opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never come up with justice , but at least they do not let the persons forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a perfect head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
a fire place on Friday at one of the highest camp@@ thouses of the world in Dubai , his play@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in only two years through the high @-@ rise building , which is by random the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ Tower ) .
the building ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ated , the injury were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we were standing at the fire@@ wall and the scre@@ am of the people up .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a inhabitants who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of the fire fight against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was dar@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said it is working on providing accommodations for those concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can also revi@@ ve questions concerning the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 was found that the largest part of the damages from the dis@@ guise , the outside wear for decoration or isolation , came .
in Britain , the police , she said that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and dis@@ guise in the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of an industry in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis tournament ( IT@@ F ) is met with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single , only on two odds to play , Hau@@ ch@@ thin was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the indeed very long , but even therefore highly valued five @-@ sentence classics remain the tradition of tradition .
6@@ 3.6 percent of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was only missing shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nation@@ als have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the making .
not only for the vote has already been the proposal before the proposal came to ex@@ or@@ ship the finale to a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists will in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue in the first round the host right in the first round .
to reduce the cost of the promot@@ er , the requirements are facilitated by training courses etc . and players will need less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring out items into the plane , finding a survey
a survey conducted under flight conditions yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consciously made items related to the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration over s@@ mug@@ gle , including at least 6 percent , which bo@@ iled the aircraft , while they were accidentally used kni@@ ves or other items with Klin@@ gen .
less than 1 per cent claimed to have discovered they had discovered that they have traveled er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - organized by a Jet @-@ Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was performed - also firmly established that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respondents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned from T@@ SA was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items found on T@@ SA &apos;s agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent pre@@ tended to have worn un@@ know@@ ingly items with blade by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respondents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respondents did confirm that they had inten@@ tionally sold drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many accidentally s@@ mug@@ glers were brought by the airport security and how many could have done it inten@@ tionally .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who have the most likely s@@ mug@@ gler - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - through security wear who were most commonly flying .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA policies are a little complicated and confusing .
the people are often unsure which liquids they may take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount used by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items of conf@@ is@@ cated liquids .
for a while , the people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mug@@ gling .
liquids is allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
o @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
at the same time , he has so far failed to re@@ tract a part of the customer for a non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant numbers of revenue increases and still huge sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k notices the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : one of the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k was often applied with the more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery starts .
now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 has already been withdrawn again .
critics always pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservation .
when cancellation pays for Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment is completely back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , sp@@ y Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production side .
in the past year Tes@@ la has supplied over 8@@ 4.000 vehicles .
2018 : all models are to be combined - 500.000 must be one million in 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
those who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be expected in the second half @-@ year 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never even in practice @-@ tested production streets without any greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum discharge .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to larger delays , then the connection of the reservations for Tes@@ la might be the problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers from getting away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief Pru@@ itt attracted to the reduction of the rules of the Obama administration to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , his former decision to delay the implementation of the Rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing aircraft .
Pru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in response to response faster than previous administration .
he did not put the law@@ suit filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
this is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ ing o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ itt announced that he will delay the compliance with a year to study the plan in order to study the Plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pru@@ dent , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time reliable opponents of strict environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt repeatedly has repeatedly passed the regulations to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden turn of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ denti@@ ary Roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Constitutional Court , decided that the EPA has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas enterprises to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pru@@ itt found that his turn@@ around with O@@ zone standards just hit the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; under previous governments , the EPA has often observed the deadlines for the execution and then waited to be indicted by activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and in an agreement communicated the appointment for the execution , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who earned the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion adopted by EPA , that at some point , his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will eventually take advantage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress will push for a more comprehensive revised ordin@@ ance of the O@@ zon@@ ator .
a bill approved in the last month of 2015 should be wai@@ ved the implementation of the rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet put into the vote in the Senate .
the New York General @-@ General prosec@@ utor Eric C@@ utting , who pursued the coalition of the States who had compl@@ ained EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is a major asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tail@@ oring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ es , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone occurs when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil sp@@ as , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are responding to sunlight .
the ent@@ able smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health professionals and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered over Pru@@ itts to a positive course change .
&quot; it is dist@@ res@@ sing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , to protect themselves from environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ bes celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ bes on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit of charity can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of the Tum@@ lin@@ ers .
Walter Martin@@ i stressed : &quot; it is a unique village of village . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ ory was first mentioned in Baden @-@ Distribution Book , Count Hermann von Sul@@ z and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; by Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and at his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , the tumor mountain apart from the erst@@ while parish church is also a glorious court which belonged to the church or the patron law and is not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that is now still visible today in the outskirts of Tum@@ bes , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the village , the Sover@@ eign sett@@ ler of the village .
old cards from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the patron saint arose from the early medieval Fe@@ ar @-@ law .
a Lord who built a church , and occupied with a pastor , continued to have owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church church .
connected with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a bishop a new parish .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two cr@@ ust at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created Glo@@ cke was then first 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in 1942 for the first time in World War II .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .
17@@ 96 stor@@ med French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the church died in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ church broke off .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m let you stand .
in the New Year 18@@ 34 a storm turned the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half rus@@ hed .
in order to prevent a disaster , the tower was stopped .
only the tower used today remained as a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are maintaining the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .
as organis@@ ers invite friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .

association wants to prove permission of wind bikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim For@@ bid himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal basis for the construction and therefore has turned towards the land Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim For@@ ced himself &quot; has requested Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ t ( CD@@ U ) to return his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border with the Schwal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration of the wind @-@ zone leads to the exclusion of wind power for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen was determined by a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a few days before by a change in the area of the area of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which was not approved by the District Court of Düsseldorf , due to a def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirements , the issued appro@@ vals is still illegal , and therefore also repe@@ al , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council did once again decided to return the wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permission of the District government is still out of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit is excluded as a permit for the construction of wind turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been made since past week by the circle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to test the matter again .
but it is likely not likely that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the ongoing trial of the administration dish , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express in content with the arg@@ umentation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette for the construction of four per 200 metres high @-@ wheels .
last year , the company , in which the city was medi@@ ated in mid @-@ Middle , with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of large terrain closed .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power demand has to be covered from around 11 400 households - this represents around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all quadru@@ ple households .
the NEW Re is willing to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , fourth City had given its green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor to cr@@ abs : woman dies at a terrible accident
one hor@@ r@@ ary traffic accident has taken place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn cable ) .
a woman was wounded in doing so .
two other people were slightly wounded .
the provincial road has been closed over hours .
following police information , a 17 @-@ year old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch was driving with her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; Home shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ t@@ er and people from the region are supposed to discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities intend to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to l@@ ure the residents to the city &apos;s shopping stroll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the customers to sensi@@ tise the customers of their own city off the usual supermarket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the market market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ at night shopping . &quot;
the promotion targets do not only play the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King .
the Municipal Auth@@ orities and commercial Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
so that the commercial association and the city go into an additional stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest along with selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to make them active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
moreover , customer potential are to be re @-@ fin@@ alized again or re @-@ opened .
this includes students and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city centre when shopping .
in the end all would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - up to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
it sailed with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y to overcome , which was partly wider , had said King in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared the first third home country shopping for the first time , five Thur@@ in@@ gia cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ ble@@ ak@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the value of local trade and promote its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the lead of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen could influence its direct environment .

tr@@ ump sat after penetr@@ ated trans@@ cribed by telephone calls and pressure due to payment of the border walls
trans@@ cription by phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Res@@ p@@ ans from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27th January , Tr@@ ump ordered in a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President ruled it because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This may not be said to the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ amp , Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first deposit with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ stones , that a trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridiculous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama Administration to let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call when he said Mr. Turn@@ key , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists hold rac@@ ist mo@@ ist act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was running through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk them to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ing strip - took a long move in its cig@@ ar and looked after by the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brood @-@ up the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the still@@ ness , when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a after@@ glow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown about the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all were in the audience very real sigh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to em@@ ulate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever indicted for the murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the after@@ glow .
&quot; it is a contamination on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a life for civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for action as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician provides a beg@@ gar on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI agents that were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding inter@@ me@@ bs in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process were susp@@ icious .
but no one has ever been prosec@@ uted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , say citizens , say the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 it made possible a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Black People in Georgia for the first time to submit their voice in the pre @-@ Elec@@ tions .
about at the same time as the choice turned according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ or of the city was , that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she bore , was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollar to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they were then approached from the prison and guided by the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a mo@@ b mo@@ b embr@@ aces the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , which has been prepared and arranged Mor@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consists of a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , rec@@ tified and rec@@ er@@ ated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks made it even more form@@ id@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you agree , then this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual desc@@ endant of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe in America no longer exists .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we will then be confronted with the gl@@ iness in us all , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have been through . &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - went into a room and had , as a Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the leader &apos; member &apos; for many years , but he said the role I never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester shou@@ ting and it pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said n -@@ -- er , swal@@ lowed up by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona recovered the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least every black actor ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ icking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &quot; n &quot; -- &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie and discomfort of discomfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed persons .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona , the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is cry , shots and then silence .
a woman who clo@@ th@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Billi@@ e Holidays griev@@ ed lob@@ bies &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice will break in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen viewers , and tears from the eyes .
the audience is split almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the road .
they all experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as op@@ pressive moisture , when Broo@@ ks leads them on pilgrimage to the funer@@ als of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air is given up .
when the last banknotes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wanted to remember it .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene liked the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch sil@@ l away and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w trans@@ acted Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who has played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aced two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in her arms , and the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flee one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience come together with the actors for dinner .
at a table chat@@ ting a white pair of Atlanta and stimulated over the after@@ glow with a black pair , which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you yourself and who do it , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me , lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks &apos; s courtyard at his table , he eats and reminds on the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; writing is in a sense of inspir@@ ational because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own story , whoever does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he had to leave 2013 a cruci@@ fying concert about himself in 2013 , there were five years later big Ju@@ bel , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call . &quot; &quot; &quot;
celebrations : Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in some ways , &quot; she had said briefly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but has enjoyed an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive summary .
Max lot works as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their voluntary year .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ urt in the furniture store , once a week I hel@@ pers here in Gre@@ ys in Gre@@ ys .
and I have already worked on the school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , thus a late working volunteer .
how does it come about ?
quantity : I have made SL@@ C .
and then a civil engineering company , we say , successfully demol@@ ished .
for me , I know that it is the wrong and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I wondered what do you do .
in a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have put great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life during the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably make training at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work@@ station and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not unusual , during the volunteer service several different areas of activity to have ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it will probably always be where you make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from anti@@ sheim to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon @-@ care guide .
for me it was exactly what has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it was going on .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to al@@ locate st@@ atics .
one always has other people &apos;s head , each of which have a different story behind themselves .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught out of the family - you always have to go individually .
very interesting .
and do you have no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a much .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son is shortened to further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their inter@@ sections by 72 percent , since another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job super@@ structure , the Director @-@ General , John Fall@@ on overwhel@@ m@@ ingly announced to the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 places .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction in May in a third cost reduction program ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the quick step towards digital learning .
the company , that last month expressed his stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House at the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ icide
a su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ter has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , one soldier of Nato killed and several other injured , say civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured , an explanation of the Nato .
un@@ confirmed local reports led to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence perpetr@@ ated by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ted two people killed near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening is to happen , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive charges &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all ver@@ ts are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the plane of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which about 20 % in the capital .
in late July , a su@@ icide @-@ car@@ n@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have carried out this attack .
on 31 May there was an enormous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the mortal milit@@ ant attack by the country , since the US @-@ led troops war@@ med the Taliban by power in 2001 .
the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump were considering the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government to have caused their policy and particularly in the cry of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA has made decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule to law@@ suits .
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has given a decision to wai@@ ve a regulation by the Obama administration , wai@@ ved what the states are obligated to d@@ ded the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done one day after 15 countries def@@ endants the Agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zon@@ ate 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and reminded that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Pru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to set o@@ zone emissions in which parts of the country must adhere to pollut@@ ant emissions in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed on Tuesday on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental pollution , which has imposed former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the reg@@ ress of Democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air that contains o@@ zone incorpor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lung function and increase the respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concer@@ t@@ action wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two items , the council of flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ z@@ eln decides to establish a communal space in the future world population .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing property was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
it will still take before until the church community has been par@@ ched @-@ up until now , but there is no plan of planning for this from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion in respect of a communal space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living area of around 55 square meters and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Council &apos;s Council have ho@@ vers such a common room just not to be seen as a meeting place for residents of the sen@@ i@@ ori@@ de living area , but open into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word made from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iling by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the restoration area .
the establishment of a communal space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve of 30 percent .
the decision of the decision provides to signal the investor that is in this respect no bil@@ let between the legs , the not@@ ing that both saddle and ambient lighting - as well as the wh@@ ow @-@ height decreases and the construction of economic power - it would be possible .
need@@ less , so do not just do Wil@@ fried sole , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously happens the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings where one can &apos;t move forward right now , but for sure you are working out of the window with the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ ter speaks absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a co@@ vert sub@@ version at any particular high @-@ level or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give up allowance , but get a real , in doubt , in the case of doubt , the counter speech .
stage request , lo@@ vel@@ ed the decision @-@ on accordingly , finds three advocates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counterparts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller collap@@ sed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we hold the decision so we make a huge step there , a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is mounted on the road
in crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by a car .
as the police ch@@ ei@@ gh , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving around 12 o &apos;clock by bike on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer way towards Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road in height of the road On Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
one in the same direction of the passenger &apos;s leader he gives him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder on the road drove , he did not appear on the road traffic .
he came together with a car , who controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old help .
the man was cut down to the street .
he suffered severe injury and was taken to a hospital with a retreat .
FC Bayern Munich must do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund to David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ede the game against Dortmund .
personnel care travel from FC Bayern to the first mandatory play of the new season to Dortmund .
seven pros are missing to the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ sie@@ ger .
personnel concerned at the German football record @-@ in Bayern Munich will be getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30@@ p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ Winner Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ever greater .
the Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BV@@ B at David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italians on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ chn@@ ya Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ ys Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defeats in the past six trial , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his crew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was not least good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult &quot; intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights are the fans in their spell .
the Parti@@ e is sold to 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , shared the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the res@@ in of Stern to Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the association of Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the informing of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , named it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connecting nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up the route along the planned route and inform about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is now planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ achie@@ vable installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired Che@@ ms St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ gre@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
therefore , in the selection of manufacturing , a good mobile network reception plays a role .
Acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
later , the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ base , the spect@@ ator tells a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger lumin@@ aire than another , though it is considerably further away .
and it will be convey@@ ed in which constellation can be a chosen star , and when it is best to see .
the association has been running since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory of northern Germany .
the headquarters in the heart of the National Park Har@@ z is named according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromeda @-@ galaxy can clearly see with the naked eye .
in the UNI @-@ city , since 2003 there has been an initiative of the promotion of Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen as something similar to the planned star value - the planetary path .
starting in front of the Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &apos; extra @-@ terrestrial site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the single planet - including the d@@ warf @-@ packed Plu@@ to at the End@@ point - are accurately positioned at the distance and standards of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , whereas the exact 75 meters from the sun pass 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the entire distance of the planet planet is about four kilometers .
while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians also need a good hour until the cam@@ els with Plu@@ to .
pedest@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fibro@@ us would still take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should be placed in a coll@@ isions course to stage the most thrilling fierce fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ sh@@ attered World Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion that went down to Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko to welcome the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ spring Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable decision over the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday to Show@@ time are both fighters of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia stretched his right hand and said , &quot; How do you go to champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
as the couple for photos related , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to get down on light weight .
and he has to move to light weight , &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ xing needs this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asking if it should be at Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who has also been interested in the fight against the winner of the Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on 23 September .
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and thrust them out later , in the network , which offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admired Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he would think the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side look very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to get the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show percussion , then boxes .
both said , they could sense the momentum that arose for their own fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tire @-@ dra@@ wer
with an accident on the A7 auto@@ bahn 4 people on Thursday afternoon four people were severely injured .
according to the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock just before the connector market wide probably after a tire @-@ burst control over his vehicle .
the passenger trail to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sm@@ ashed and then remained on the roof of the ro@@ am .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured due to the rescue service , the A7 was blocked in the direction of north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ strip could be subject to the accident point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangles work better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses at Au@@ e points brings .
with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , though not the two oppos@@ ites had been with 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to put even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ ck@@ ette is also further optimised .
and a gate after a fre@@ ist@@ o@@ ß want to feed the Fort@@ unas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no longer besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experiences in preparation with the tri@@ ck@@ ette than with the qu@@ artet .
&quot; yet I do not know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ ne &apos;s funk , but Hoffmann is certain to his cause , &quot; because we just have in the tri@@ ck@@ ette on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann player who can build fine , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condition is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ise and we can &apos;t afford as many mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot speak after an un@@ decided from a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of an extraordinary season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this , his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; at the start of the season , I first reviewed six to eight players &apos; days , &quot; said Fried@@ helmet Fun@@ kel , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ matur@@ ely due to a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann to believe that players from Au@@ e could possibly even be a little fres@@ her , since they wouldn &apos;t have a serious and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhein@@ land go as an easy favorite on Sunday in meeting in the finally ( almost ) the finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we use them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says funk , whose balance is absolutely positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to hit the beginning , &quot; explained Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , funk will not experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( Parti@@ cipation Act ) started conducting the tests last year .
in the asylum process the evaluation of the age should make more precise after the Swedish migration authorities ( mig@@ r@@ atory producers ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the proper age of some refugees that were inf@@ erior .
until today , mig@@ r@@ appro@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been to test@@ able cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evalu@@ ates that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years old or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &apos; may be under 18 years old &apos; .
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent during the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see much difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has lied over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the subjects should be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical aging assessment , in x @-@ ray @-@ sho@@ ots of white @-@ teeth and MR@@ I recordings of knee prototypes , which are then analyzed in some areas also has been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were used sooner or later as usual due to pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe .
if we can &apos;t say it sure we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of testing : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult un@@ correct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ tic , Bau@@ leader in the department of tram@@ ways and Traffic in the government of the Council of Freiburg .
in April , the work started at all three sandy Bri@@ dges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October , and it is certain that the schedule is observed .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , which is em@@ bell@@ ished with cherry b@@ art@@ ar and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
as the other two bridges also , it has now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly restored .
the two other bridges leads through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from Red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were established in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
that is an edge fix , which is also used as a run away .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge should be inserted on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge cap .
that should then be the pedestrian road .
the special thing is that it is well @-@ finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge .
special flair has demanded the trac@@ table of lines through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass table that many firms are connected to each other .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of work by hand@@ outs concerning the project .
furthermore , at first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building church and the collection @-@ back in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village , the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three Brü@@ ck@@ oos amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ g in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower in protest with German potato salad
it is not so frequent that parties are pulling in a cord , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ g ) , comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the Krem@@ lin volcano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows on this day peacefully , because the Af@@ g in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Rathaus Ron@@ dell in addition to the poster &quot; big electoral campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land formed the leading directors for the Bundest@@ ags election on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already before the event at the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ ters but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now finds itself on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ for@@ ge event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum One World and one of the leaders , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; original potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ for@@ ged without problems , &quot; says the woman who has brought him back .
the police made many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the railway station , just a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ g come up on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the A@@ fr@@ o Vol@@ can@@ es reported that he tries to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had been asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a failure , because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ y , there were not enough parking places available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 8 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Af@@ g @-@ chair Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 audiences , which are waiting for the leading edge di@@ at@@ ine for the Bundest@@ ags , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of Beatri@@ x by Stor@@ ch said their speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ g event , the guests on the court have long breath , but even there it is short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can dis@@ m - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets the trumpet
a reunion with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ched Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is there in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concer@@ ted tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the mon@@ ast@@ erial church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bal@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classic German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and should start Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European peak orches@@ tras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ t is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two like in a new guise , Daniel Ste@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Y@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ al N@@ ils W@@ anda , mix classical , jazz and free games at an intrigu@@ ing work of art .
this core of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with tremendous success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ils wrote it especially for the two musicians and more and more : the h@@ acher Klo@@ p@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with its particular acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kr@@ isten Stewart openly talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if I want to teach in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh this was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ wood@@ wood@@ star was that at her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who ultimately worked hard .
despite all this insur@@ ing the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &apos;s magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with anyone I was working .
or do you believe about , I could have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kr@@ isten got to say that it was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and believed serious about du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or ham@@ pered .
I just liked it , not seriously being taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially they suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time , when they sat down like a bu@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really has got me very seriously .
when I eleven had told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public , they don &apos;t like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to mention in a certain way and that anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps some call me un@@ ank@@ le , but I don &apos;t like it to be justified before the whole public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Rever@@ b that he would change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of pon@@ der ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a HU@@ GE announcement in West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not convince the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes clearly states that he owns carbon mines in five states and inherited a coal @-@ store from his father .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party which would rather prevent us from working in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ments and the control of the least illegal bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , fixed message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be absorbed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct to the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were picked up with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress backed the maintenance of the prohi@@ bitions , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence on public @-@ sponsored links in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e .
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress was so pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced some quite hot times and everything is possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia was accepting the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been achieved but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninete@@ en Russian athletes become at the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London to compete in the rigor@@ ous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must fulfill some of the criteria for a re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement .
Dro@@ gent@@ ests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council .
ob@@ itu@@ d@@ ment for Mali rep@@ uted soldiers
at a funeral party in Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two have been designed by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
for un@@ resolved crash , Secretary of Defence of Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it described the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their field &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to have been the highest sacrifice in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old stab@@ le@@ man from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ers were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a killing of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ t@@ er Cathedral St. Peter brought .
at mid@@ day , only the relatives were farewell to the Church .
then the funeral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , and of politics .
these were also H@@ ess@@ ful Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Deputy Chief of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
the mour@@ ning lay down rose , the relatives were arm and arm to the singing .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ t@@ er and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the defense ministers of the Le@@ yen called the up@@ beat soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filled &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the air @-@ operation of the assault rif@@ le Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with it and was one of the first six educated tiger drivers of his Regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if the crew failed to turn the crash , there would not have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubt about the UN @-@ Mission in Mali the Prime Minister did not show : the bet is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are separated only by two states &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are bes@@ ted , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want to appoint a tomb near his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to feed his death alongside his wife .
the divided the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish Royal King is buried in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her man , it says further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik will bury is still unclear .
but he did not intend to set up the intent in his French home .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a secret of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
in 2016 , he reti@@ ring and also sets the title of &quot; princess @-@ ray . &quot;
because Hen@@ rik in Denmark didn &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , said L@@ ene b@@ allet , the chief priest of the Danish King &apos;s house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he had not the intent of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ late , Mar@@ gre@@ the was met in London in 1965 .
at the Thames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people had always flew with Prince Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 years of reg@@ ression with the Dan@@ es a heavy stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography expressed by Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after I arrived , everything I did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my D@@ än@@ isch was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ str@@ ing@@ ed instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and those in this country had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope to see .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to be swift new
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
excessive Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green administration multip@@ lies for a rapid re@@ election of the country on Sundays , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the res@@ ignation of a Green MEPs from her Land@@ tag fraction expressed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) plung@@ ed into a serious crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the Land@@ tag , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its scarce Ein @-@ vote majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was vice versa .
the new country date will be regular in January 14 of this year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green country @-@ government must now decide whether or not they can be ruling in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Wei@@ l is however essential that the country before rapidly decides his self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further procedure on Tuesday .
the state of affairs also provides the possibility that the country &apos;s parliament votes for trust and chooses his successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these options must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the Tw@@ enty step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was called a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ ell@@ ent members for the return of their land call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that it has received its land visa that has received them over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group Leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have deliberately decided not to lead a language in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no major differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD emb@@ assies Mr Schulz condemned the over@@ head of the British Gre@@ ens @-@ parliament@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green parliament@@ arians in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Chief of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , which is quickly re @-@ elected the country of parliament .
the res@@ ignation Tw@@ enty costs red @-@ Green in Nieder@@ sachsen the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political writer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her frustration gave her personal interests ahead of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U is involved in Lower Saxony in Lower Saxony and attempts to beat its political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; low @-@ compliance CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ west before , with personality career thinking the result of the German @-@ election 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy .
the CD@@ U was the strongest power , SPD and Green party at that time in front of the SPD , but a thin @-@ thin majority of one voice at the time before the SPD .
Agriculture Ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect itself from toxic eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to carefully view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stress pressure .
the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the Eg@@ gs @-@ Char@@ gen on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if for everything we presently know , a health threat is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes the best possible crisis response - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched and is located in the announcement of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are retri@@ ev@@ able for consumers .
trade is exactly the same as the producers to ensure that the goods sold locally are harmless and are not harmless .
if passed with eggs of the resi@@ dual amount of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not pedestrian .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time are not the companies to blame .
sitting plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
after the par@@ amount of knowledge the production companies meet no immediate blame .
rather , they have to reck@@ on due to mut@@ able illegal practices of services with economic damage .
as always , there is too little controversy in the worst .
is there only a lack of staff or at the key jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth also belongs , though , that food @-@ fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out of 100 per cent .
precisely that is why we are a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already highlighted several times that I expect a seamless education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular trig@@ gering on food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer and consumers have the right to obtain solely safe and reduced foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide use in the food industry , consumer protection and consumers are rightly ashamed .
by the penetr@@ ated means manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it has to be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivery . animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be consistent at all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities that the expert will be solved fast and in@@ si@@ dious .
how the financial rules for football to operate on ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered expenses of the European football matches will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world ch@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by UEF@@ A still , because the leading organisation which over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A launched , mean that PS@@ G should eventually prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without great losses .
Barcelona has 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to pick the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money is easy , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy of the rich mist@@ ress family of Qatar .
clubs may apply for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but need to take control with legitimate income sources , which allow the break @-@ even point in relation to football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had taken tremendous debt in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ki@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P ranked on the debt of the clubs for monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which used the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch , originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to improve the crew and build a global brand - become a tougher matter .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini &apos;s 2015 is fallen by the presidency in the in@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat fee , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year treaty , so that waste @-@ sol@@ vents can be exp@@ elled from 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G was given a penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remained limited .
the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could try to list their supervis@@ ors by offering their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could not exceed the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing the standard market rates should exceed the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was charged by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to J@@ ym@@ ar will be made over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Championship in Qatar .
however , PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar Cup ass@@ adors will be ass@@ adors and that such a maneu@@ ver could be easy to find out for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to adhere to rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
in the last published reports , PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrive a bo@@ on for sponsorship &apos;s De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s for@@ ge by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; co @-@ financing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last resort to PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and this has completely changed the whole landscape of the football for the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger was on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ver supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the standing collaboration is ahead of a possible end : the airline notes the order again .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
under current planning , the airline in the first half @-@ year will launch a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small red @-@ white Sch@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ eln led to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to provide Swiss information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ sider value the order volume in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; north @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter deals with an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is once the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants are there at the new tender , the Swiss will not reveal .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond the Spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer is not available for an opinion .
chocolate tablets distri@@ butes Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss made a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo was Swiss @-@ two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ distance flights , customers of the First Class with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ ine jumps will be pampered , in business class n@@ ag passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also in the short distance Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ 90s com@@ edy , &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ( turned ) and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd left to larger things .
as cultural ar@@ te@@ facts , it is equally o@@ dy and an embodiment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only for its absur@@ dity ( it contained an original story for a promising den@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by turning into the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ middle ages have been vacc@@ inated children who grow to grow - yet they created the im@@ possibility of winning the final part of the jo@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years later &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults is less emotional and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the g@@ ie@@ ves principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand , which is the cradle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point of view a character through an Apple &apos;s Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central histor@@ ies are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Romanesque , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy vi@@ cious P@@ lot , in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the expor@@ ters are the best part of the franchise .
it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ eb@@ b beard of &apos; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random madness , that could include this franchise , like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches that which I will display as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : &quot; the last scene the gang is how they will visit the premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : at the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ West @-@ West Bank I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy produced by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created a found TV series with Rh@@ ys Thomas : a Romanian Drama of the 1980 &apos;s , with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the protagon@@ ist - a hard @-@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ ose@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs of ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are syn@@ ced .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful places for watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on television , such as Americans may do with football . )
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - takes the voice out for a decent game .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often played like a single one .
in six long episodes it is moving , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ ated to a lesser length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could better supply , as Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f again and again visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the integrated communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a brass .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in pushing for the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were numerous objects searched for , like the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 patients were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and was already issued arrest warran@@ t against such arrest warran@@ t .
moreover , the officials expressed greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians were German arrest warran@@ t .
therefore the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the campaign Italian and Bav@@ arian investigations were involved .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the ma@@ fia belongs to organised drug crime , heavy violence , trials , and rob@@ bery and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already since summer 2016 , the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance against the organized drug trafficking in the Southern German region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was an path@@ ogen , and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the great effort on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of investigations , mainly Italian national @-@ nation@@ als with little reference to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , during which several shots were fired in a restaurant in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
otherwise compl@@ ained large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly grave mis@@ steps in asylum @-@ proceedings .
the Bed@@ ou@@ ted for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has made a media report closely related to large gaps in the country of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the recorded data could lead in asylum @-@ procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly grave mis@@ steps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by some 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data was not adequately kept , the data quality in parts has not been good .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer should arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data messages can be significantly slow@@ ing down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says the report on further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on average people , EU citizens must be recorded who would not have had to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , such false accus@@ ation led to a distorted debate on how to deal with aliens , it means that it is stated in the analysis .
meanwhile the federal government began to return to Italy with children under 16 @-@ old children once they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this appears from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ at@@ cher Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it says that BAM@@ F carry out such procedures as to families with children - except infants and infants - to Italy since the 1st of June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper presents a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to substanti@@ ate write the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the recep@@ tive capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic political spokes@@ person in the left wing in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision , &quot; families with children due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful reception conditions and a haz@@ ard to the child of child . &quot;
second @-@ best results achieved
in a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood of the people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood@@ shed was already available for other people .

at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation led the spec@@ ulations of a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they held interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank set up with 6 % to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereby less members reached a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support for an increase .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal income would continue to continue , whereby inflation in fall is expected to rise to almost 3 % .
but it sign@@ alised that during the next few years , Zin@@ o@@ ca@@ vities would be necessary to cha@@ sten the inflation of the Bre@@ xit would have had to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to retreat a part of the Mam@@ mut package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will take time to finance the financial plan to provide cheap funds for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that they will be able to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the Gross Dom@@ estic Product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to impe@@ de consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the interest rates they reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain pen@@ al of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets also forecasts the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that under@@ mining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year will be forec@@ ast@@ ed 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the growth forecasts of the Bank for this year .
it has retained its growth forecasts for 1.8 percent in the year 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages about the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell at 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth in growth had been damp@@ en rising expectations on a level of interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the recent in@@ filtration report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and minor salary , since the intensi@@ fication becomes first even worse before it gets improved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent an income from the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also enhanced by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound weight , which is compensated for a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision will come a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the sound regime .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will be fully reaching the prices and the economy .
before the final verdict of the Bank on the rate of interest rates , the call for a level of interest had risen , since inflation led pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding a rise to 0.5 % .
the inflation has declined in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them in the coming months .
the Bank said that proceeds in relation to their target of 2 % is &quot; totally &quot; to assign a weak pound weight .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again since the len@@ ders want to search for shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ als are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The national health service ) aims to pres@@ cribe more controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September after a fight against the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk of risk by about 86 percent , now is supplied by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed last year a verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice , after which N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should fund it .
the trial announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) performed this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first who will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in the whole of England .
preventive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced the HIV @-@ transmission in infection @-@ endangered .
taking Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that right enough medication in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who come to treatment are pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor &apos;s physician may also be able to participate in their local participating sexual clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs in this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of the Pr@@ EP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is implemented in a large scale and is implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to reduce HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted on needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk , people will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument which is really controlled individually and not with a negotiating with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now needs to be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has taken a risk to HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP @-@ trial is after monthly delays and hesit@@ ant implementation of the government welcomes and over@@ due .
the evidence show how transforming this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help to end the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life living : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square footage was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a scr@@ ap@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a me@@ zz@@ anine to best use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , they commissioned the Architektur@@ e- und Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that make 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for yo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so the architectural challenge in it consisted of creating a me@@ zz@@ anine with which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked out , without having to decorate them .
not only did it go to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this arrangement granted it Er@@ fan , to place two rooms in full , with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine can look down a classic cl@@ utch window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let him last longer .

through the perception of a glam@@ orous room the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .

brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar property
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest property of the Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , worth more than 500 million dollars .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers spent 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated , since the 1973 family bought a deal in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
it founded the West@@ co je@@ ans family and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her departed father , Col@@ in - von Paul as &quot; chief operator and the dominant personality &quot; has described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s fortune and Paul about one third .
a jurisdiction states that it means that Col@@ in possesses property valued by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth in value of € 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has shown itself to Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I kept for the best objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed appearances , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed him to be excluded .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but also throws Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Mon@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to teach the battle .
&quot; my Italian legacy is writing that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
MS De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen stores were operated from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
you used the security to purchase the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , opened in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans@@ ing of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was in High School in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company , and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very very sad@@ dened to me that my brother Paul decided to curse me and to draw our family names through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father wouldn &apos;t have wanted to say that Paul and I would end in our current battle , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved in the near future by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps of new Staff plan to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the head on a more equ@@ itable course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ kins :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with executive staff , he was a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he fixed : poor information that came into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information should be used on him - whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame trou@@ gh by monitoring his media own media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship with television last decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; when candidate was upset due to an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were persu@@ asi@@ ve , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign in it to ensure his personal media consumption has a steady lob@@ ster . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ridiculous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officers know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets have not included any more spark @-@ fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never hear anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his staff made it a few times , ag@@ gra@@ vation of it away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no @-@ one has consistently prevented it that tr@@ ump controversi@@ es deri@@ ves .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that advocates from compet@@ ed parties , always try to move their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material , which may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this history - reported in May about the anticip@@ ation of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons , to provide doub@@ tful information .
this was an example which was described by repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ ak@@ ks , and that he will find out to find out where these come .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone had accused a printed copy of an article by Got@@ ic .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , which accused the Deputy Commander @-@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
though Johnson was rel@@ eg@@ ated from Twitter because of str@@ aps , or that he has no specific evidence or has re@@ vo@@ iced wrong alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold @-@ song@@ writer said that the then staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly strives to do the same three months later .
maybe he is prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive to influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hoped for .
the police ma@@ iled all over Europe this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the requested heavy criminal are not known , there will be indications of the population and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which is following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have been shown that many mysteries had to hide from vacation destinations , called it from Euro@@ pol .
there have been 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website has been www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ an , more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online songs have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them due to indications after publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; million@@ aire series &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands face again with some determined travelers on war , which negotiated one of the parish to demand a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
travelers have their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought with horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they have been thrown out only in May , but were scr@@ ap@@ ed from a dig@@ ging dit@@ ch to prevent their incidents .
the intact group found a gap in the defense units and thrust their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said , &quot; They were moved on Monday night after they were sent further by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones on the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to cope with how to keep long re@@ mitt@@ ances to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my com@@ part@@ ying if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a community who did not want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to pl@@ under@@ ed from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have this time increased and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of a unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our motiv@@ ating collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants as many inhabitants enter an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must verify when we will present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ ance company mbH and the 13th of April 2014 some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by the visitor &apos;s tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the rise of refugees who came to the district of the district , the hotel building of the District Fund was offered as a consolidated room , which was prompt for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the installation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not under dispute .
but above all Freud &apos;s supreme commander in the town of Os@@ se@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers to the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ orph@@ ans with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ ter with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ ch at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
you called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ fer@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof have long since extended time Bau@@ sch@@ utt@@ ony in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , there will be a lot of renov@@ ations .
the so@@ ils were ri@@ pped , blankets to the extent built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is one single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ ier expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
if you do not want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in foli@@ age @-@ bath , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes more .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is to be set up , explained further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversation with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so sw@@ ans .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment needed , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not commit itself exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
outside installations are brought to front line , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the public , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Mon@@ key : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler sets out Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump , special collectors of Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a report to a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the Panel recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the subject of trusted persons .
the newspaper added the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended and intensified his investigation .
the channel CN@@ N reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ ta in connection with a meeting between the tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a longer time mixed to the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were connections between the m@@ umps of the election team and Moscow .
in the investigation of investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also accepted more and more tr@@ umps private and busy environment among the L@@ upe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special educ@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally moved into the centre and looking for the re@@ pro@@ ach if the president hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to check the present evidence of possible hear@@ ings and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called dock .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the process is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on from the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office to re@@ charge persons for the hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N channels were already exhibited preliminary shows that revol@@ ve around the confrontation between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. too have also been tr@@ umps advis@@ ers and in @-@ law son Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort meeting at the interview .
right @-@ experts said on Thursday night in the US @-@ television that the entry may show that Mu@@ eller would not go too shy during his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
at the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new cause of concern for president Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new dis@@ closures , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia @-@ affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , because they have nothing else to speak about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion that he doesn &apos;t know anything about the installation of a Grand Jury .
but this work also usually in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House supports all measures which accelerated the work of special medi@@ ator in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey took three times that not against the president .
we have no reason to accept that something has changed on it , it says in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump com@@ ey had fired .
because of this re@@ pro@@ sy , alleg@@ ations were opposed to Tr@@ ump , he did not want to impe@@ de the judiciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for an adjustment of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
according to the representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special instruc@@ tors and his staff .
these spec@@ ulate spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller released .
unlike an independent special agency of the congress , as for example in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate @-@ affair concerning the later appointed President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has imposed a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the President of the judiciary in theory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties wish to advance such a step further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday , after which the special bre@@ aches could no longer be released .
Antarc@@ tica : giant ice@@ berg drives in the Antarc@@ tica
in the west @-@ Arctic , a giant ice@@ berg has solved itself from the narro@@ west size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
the other than a tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large col@@ oss are now driving up north and will probably take two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice giants who have registered the researchers in the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go out of him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice@@ berg , it is still unclear .
but in total , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs of ice @-@ downs in the region for about 30 years , the US Centers for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) writes in a billing background .
according to many researchers , this can be connected with global warming .
the broken Kol@@ b was a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i so far .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ i swi@@ ms inside the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it therefore grows further into the sea and is constantly breaking down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America , almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
just north of this shr@@ ines was the balance of wa@@ xing and vom@@ iting some years ago .
a complete she@@ dding is dis@@ appearing there , writes AW@@ I researcher , Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I &apos;m talking about it , too , that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the fore Canadi@@ ans have never withdrawn as far as currently .
moreover , the ice @-@ plate is at stress and can be dis@@ rupted in case of a key@@ hole , a piece of p@@ out .
the m@@ elt from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg increases the sea level , as it can float on the water and ice cold as much water as it comes after the m@@ elt itself .
however , the loss of shame leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low dimensions , the British research project writes to observation of the Antarc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I @-@ statements with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest ch@@ ili@@ fe@@ is of the Antarc@@ tica .
at the end of the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks off .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of the direct connection with climate change , the ice@@ sign comes now into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the record &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ ery will now be growing again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers will not go back to climate change , this gigantic ice@@ berg will not fall back on climate change , so in the past few decades , many ice@@ bergs of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula are sm@@ ashed .
this long dial in the Antarc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula declined since the 1950s around 28@@ ,000 square kilometers .
there have contributed to the decline of temperature increased .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has passed over the past 50 years by around three degrees and t@@ amed into the areas where the temperature at the fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants door @-@ if in the personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to filling open positions , the CD@@ U , from the employer association , calls for embar@@ king and become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag opened 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the administration office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 appren@@ tices have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applicants were registered for the seats this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is a lack of personnel to be able to cope with the Ascen@@ ded requirements and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , there are still no vac@@ ancy in circles of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ W@@ G together with the F@@ DP and the pro @-@ shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is meant to work out a concept for human resource recovery and personnel development , according to the wish of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for qualified workers but forward @-@ looking for the application of application , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational campaign , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G .
this sounds like a good approach already .
because the circle has to do with human problems that one did not know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , who will leave disease or age related to the service .
thus , the highest time for action therefore , that no longer remain un@@ occupied .
yet Klaus @-@ Dieter People , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the same application with his party .
he was t@@ apped already in the cre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he publicly asked human resources and was start@@ led by the other parties .
people want to be reviewed all possibilities that enable a res@@ ignation from the municipal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county seat should aim with trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a hood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CD@@ U attempts to better pay the employees and officials , as it envis@@ ages the public services for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , under@@ mining or more money there is only when you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be arranged in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO migrants &quot; li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that it cannot continue to continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs fail to sign a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ority &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth ret@@ ters &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration .
the aid organisation which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express our detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ ut@@ ors Am@@ bro@@ gio carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected , only after we have collected all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had surv@@ eyed the boat of &quot; youth ret@@ tes , &quot; the Iu@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is believed that his crew takes on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants , which can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers and that the s@@ mug@@ gler cannot be used to allow the vessels to be used again .
at least such a coincidence , it was said that only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , the content of Italian media was published .
the occupation is suspected that the authority of the Italian coastal forces , b@@ ail@@ out the life@@ jack@@ ets in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iu@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police Officer on board who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were as unnecessary but acceptable , as they wouldn &apos;t bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue services . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is .
Minn@@ ie said in the meantime that the number of migrants launched after the rescue operations in Italy , had greatly declined in recent weeks , sug@@ gesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month through economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ downs and Tri@@ als
nine women &apos;s bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region in order to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
there were three be@@ fri@@ ended guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted a hot summer @-@ temperatures along the vineyards for the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .

console of law@@ ns - Bundesliga ge@@ ars for e @-@ sport
sitting in the future sport @-@ stars in future before computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating out to fight with wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages .
these have also identified the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ das , which are increasingly being engaged in this area .
the beginning did 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in the middle of July and took two professionals for FIFA World Cup .
&quot; we hope to get all new young audiences in the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; said the Management Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still a lot of associations on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the World Cup FIFA World Cup will organize in London the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal in particular with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian one .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could have been more often present on these markets more often than once a year to send to Asia .
what is all about ?
in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just dealt with football @-@ simulation FIFA on the competition level .
long ago , as in the normal sport , have established , Li@@ gen , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the A@@ sians to 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe to need .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been faced with the issue .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport because it is Com@@ peti@@ tive and contains a lot of biological and physical responses , which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
furthermore , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and watch the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bers also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls be difficult in online play difficult , and in the scene the structures of classic sports was missing .
positive stresses the scientists to the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the way , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study conducted by corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Association Inter@@ aktive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) is pre@@ dict the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , we have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .
sales should be at 130 million in three years .
in spite of the nearly 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
internationally , many countries are already continuing .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is taking part in the US team NR@@ W e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot is done .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport had been introduced as educational , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league from the Netherlands are in the meantime required to set up an E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia to fail and the old days to clarify , is no longer sufficient .
it &apos;s about preserving the tradition of the association but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we are living in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t .
&quot; one can not stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy condemn as su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by lyrics and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation , and five years have been exposed to trial .
Carter was condemned in June by Con@@ rad Roy racing , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy did the hearing at the hearing : &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free up to the appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ ased bl@@ ouse clo@@ th@@ ed , he stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ oriented eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; your actions have transformed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court .
&quot; they ended his life in order to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has not shown any re@@ do . &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a nasty circumstance that they completely regret . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor did read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I would not mour@@ n the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother , or she would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I was together since my birth each day is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts where it makes it a crime to challenge another , su@@ icide , su@@ ic@@ ide@@ .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy did dead from carbon mon@@ oxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters outlined texts revealed that it was encouraged to end his life .
&quot; hanging yourself , Spring of a building , do you yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ju@@ iz Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that they will profit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was condemned in 2007 for murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted of two years ago .
MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain in the Audi Cup , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern @-@ aut of the Con@@ fed cup winner a big season to - extra motivation turns out there .
something was otherwise at his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ Kim@@ ber@@ immediately , although the extra piece of clothing very small was very small .
but there is far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself the dis@@ distributed bin@@ de content to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not have announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ captain .
good , the one could have run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach was not able to imply that .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was in the youth @-@ playing , Deb@@ ates and especially chosen for the holidays of the existing C @-@ El@@ f chosen as a gam@@ er , but he .
su@@ l is best found to those who want to see a lot , which one wants to keep in mood .
those who have chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s legacy can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right at the back , this is his position , the white bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and in fact , Kim@@ me appeared in this stage @-@ formation like the one who can take the helm again in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to draw the un@@ matched tro@@ upe .
he had the view to the whole while many others were concerned with himself .
V@@ idal therewith , his missing fitness to play ( folding hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus , on the Devil come out to the achievements of the Asia trip ( folding also only partially ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus to fall into their first appearance in Bavaria Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this after all the fol@@ ly pretty good .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agile sovereign .
the nam@@ ing occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm is often difficult , moreover , South also tried to succeed in building up a couple of times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave me that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed at the debut a decent performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play shift , change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I got also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ accustomed to this Bayern world nor for the new arri@@ vals , we looked at the game afterwards .
Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ myself spoke after a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Bavaria you just have to win any game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , this must not teach the new one more .

company happy with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : Wirtschaft lo@@ aves Wis@@ dom Tempo
it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic ministries in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year , in which the new economic ministers Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and also bl@@ am@@ bling the old secretary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ ers ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the run@@ time of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s primary list .
this year the Ministry hopes for a planning process to 2021 the building is to stand up to 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west @-@ byp@@ assing Tri@@ er , which stands in the ha@@ unting needs of the Federal Convention .
the goal is to take the track in December 2020 in operation , says Assistant Secretary of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign in order to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to increase the sales of a Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label in order to increase the sales volumes in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the coming German wine exports for ten years .
moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to base their own company , are ur@@ ging the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees an additional incentive for young appren@@ tices , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
envis@@ aged is a bonus of 1000 euros for the measurement of master and 2,500 euros if graduates are independent within ten years of vocational training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road structure are quickly facts to create , at the same time , it l@@ acked the country at the necessary staff , says Jan bell tower , main business leader of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er .
of 56 new engineers , that wants to employ Wis@@ sing in the state of mobility , until now 29 jobs are occupied .
the Chamber of Industry asks to forgive more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U group Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the calculation of calculation , invested in 2017 and 2018 for more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of inland roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
De@@ so@@ bri@@ ety is also the previous broad@@ band installation in the country .
in the year 2016 , regional companies had been re@@ assessed the power supply in a HK @-@ pol@@ l only with the score 3.4 .
it protects the pitch @-@ up Internet connections and break@@ downs .
at the moment , ex @-@ economic ministries in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the S &amp; D Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of dis@@ agreement , the Gre@@ ens ruled the field .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said , the company is of the opinion that &quot; there is smar@@ ter options as travel restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described businesses as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and may cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plant equipment to neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases to be installed , also take too what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful trading companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , to regulate the use of so @-@ called isolation devices that could be adjusted to comply with emissions when a car has been tested , but go back to normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees have been indicted by Volkswagen , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics of Audi was arrested in Germany in the automobile development of Audi .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed the emission standards in Europe , and a request that has been concentrated on the United States .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could load Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer has over dis@@ proportion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message created the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar

mor@@ dil@@ los mu@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against grief
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most published cartoon carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ ies of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 sets the Argent@@ ines and works in a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : to laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed among other things as poin@@ ter to congrat@@ ulated cards - which led him to fru@@ ct@@ ose .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris ended the breakthrough at the end of the &apos; 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
over and over again the artist of cities inspire .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo , cav@@ or@@ ting in drawings with the narrow tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting in the drawing with his own details today , works on a daily basis for almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches find his dro@@ p@@ ous figures still much spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a animation film and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los @-@ tested animal in his drawings - which has a jack &apos;s feet as a counter player .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 , on the cinema wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he sets out more on the TV series , which , like its original description , is produced .
laven@@ der from Provence on climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the laven@@ der is due to the poor reminis@@ cent conditions and because of the diseases of suspected insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions to find great head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ ins , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the laven@@ der in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has a lot less rain in the spring and in autumn much more .
this has an effect on the life of laven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and in very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
laven@@ der oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ ins said : &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in We@@ dn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for the recent chaos in the State Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discussed what feels more secure : they should take their children to office , who were in 2009 the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or they leave them at home .
safety experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal num@@ eric .
there are drug s@@ mug@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ects on the government list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite of violence , and throughout the country the bodies of cor@@ p@@ ses , are always more journalists at the same time : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are based on attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is its editors and her inspir@@ er from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be re@@ porter , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence in the context of drugs .
its absence is felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which indicates his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; depends on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , tee t @-@ shirts , who exhibit his smiling face with spect@@ acles or its typical Panam@@ anian truth .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discussed their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Office was established in 2010 , in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it was introduced by the committee to protect journalists by only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders who are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely put in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist that the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a must be treated , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more con@@ ical .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting in discussion of security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very silly to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know , mis@@ trust us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was shot of two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot to him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ter river . &quot;
the swe@@ ar@@ cher was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of executed , two @-@ story mouse ole@@ to for drug addic@@ tions , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he has broken his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
at first , in February the publication of a interviews with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ on in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this release might have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was that Val@@ dez has not been forced to force Val@@ dez after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his kill@@ ings is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues thinks he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues for the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism , without encounter@@ ing an anti @-@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper has earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and the revenues and publicity took place .
re@@ porter loved it to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &apos; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &apos; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J prize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task you do as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ mies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many things ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a long@@ shor@@ eman , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
it would always go to El Guay@@ an@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and always sit on the same table .
well , they ask , was his love of the routine of his destruction ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how to best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it when you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their c@@ anny and run@@ ways to get drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ elling wrong , b away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days previously it became known that Spy@@ ware is sold exclusively to governments , for the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside they sought two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , the governor itself was not trustworthy .
it &apos;s been a few months since the re@@ porter moved to the mountain landscape , where the drug @-@ gangs are de facto control .
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has engra@@ ved on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known box@@ er Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the State expendi@@ tures , focusing on the hometown of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the Office of the Public Pro@@ secution , a ab@@ duction .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug makers and authorities .
a re@@ porter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the ruling institutional revolution party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ containing cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real beg@@ ged the repor@@ ters to write about previous events in this pub , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man was deprived of military emergency .
only a few months before , the reader had viewed the colum@@ n@@ ist from Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ u@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to storage room for characters and sti@@ ckers who were dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
the re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ ap@@ ed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Office of the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez has been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
in the whole country , journalists have become sound@@ ly devast@@ ated by organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and structures .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez def@@ ying the authorities , journalists pronoun@@ ce and release them , because they said the truth .
it has been asked for ever since it has been divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has violated their obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in joining the government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug persons but also on the command of politicians and security guards which coinci@@ ded with organized crime among a blan@@ ket .
the media group &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was held more than half of the attacks on the police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico , you live , because you would like the mouth of the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as at the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that supposedly was signed by Z@@ etas &apos;s Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer stat@@ u@@ ur and ear@@ phones located next to their separated head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border @-@ state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make such as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly announced the drug addiction to a title page with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland , or even the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and look for dangers .
and sometimes she hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in a flat in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ sharing decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that the drug could frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already completed , editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ enri@@ v@@ als and security forces near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continues to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding @-@ edge you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens r@@ ams nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view of the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid @-@ finger was visible to Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how you can only remember &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day she was murdered by Javier , who asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to differ its enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain labor@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish , and they said , she could have had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animated @-@ down dinosau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which ever was found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered sort of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbelie@@ v@@ ably well preserved condition has researchers , which it as &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was aston@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Geographic , the le@@ ased plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , den .
he met something that seemed lacking of the surrounding rocks at the venue , and decided to see more accurately .
this was discovered by him fossil was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled .
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main writer Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen .
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa &apos;s dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found out that this herbal e@@ ater , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably of meat eating dinosau@@ rs has been threatened .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as a counter @-@ protection , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to ming@@ le better in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by greater dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature made from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta distinctive with the Museum technology Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the ast@@ ounding maintenance of copies offered it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors through his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ king , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter@@ move is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs of sufficient pressure carried out by meat un@@ iting dinosau@@ rs has been hun@@ ted that evolution fav@@ oured the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ atti@@ re - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or pupp@@ ets - are much smaller and hur@@ tful as prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ ger was suspended to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was mar@@ oon .
scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his fourth performer to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ r when he died , pushed into a river and went out into the sea where he sank to the back to the se@@ ab@@ ed .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with cont@@ emp@@ t skin , but also in three dimensions remains preserved and the original form of the animal is attached , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need much fantasy to use to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time , as giant thermal opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , walked the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ ca@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of wei@@ ght@@ less monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been diver@@ ted after the death in the sea and to the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , den .
according to the museum , it is the animated @-@ p@@ umped dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the p@@ umped crop @-@ e@@ aters has been blown by the Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the sub@@ strate of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cl@@ ums@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed boards along the dinosau@@ r cover
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a profit in the lottery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ use it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied resi@@ du@@ es of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy p@@ boards that carry the skull of the beast .
his re@@ chter will be on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales up at its sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass @-@ cart .
there are numerous ver@@ ts , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) the late Thursday afternoon at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people had been injured .
after the first information of the police were at 5 p.m. between the connector Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ circle A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , including probably also trucks .
on the exact number of recent weeks , there are no information provided .
it is light to medium @-@ serious injury , said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher .
there was a big entrance to rescue vehicles at the accident point .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Dri@@ ving Munich a approximately ten kilometers long flight back was formed .
as an AZ @-@ repor@@ ters reported , it came also on the counter @-@ driving way to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ fighters were noted the characteristics of the vehicle , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , the second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
thereby it was a collision between a car accident and a passenger .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again : absolutely ins@@ ults is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are wi@@ dening in his work and just has an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creator and w@@ akes up an uns@@ an@@ yard or pull off the gli@@ de in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn comm@@ its the creator control at the moment .
you simply confirm via mobile phone that you have taken his seat and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; the offer is offered , we extend it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway the ticket utilization without any way of creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do already .
it also has to be purchased via the app , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and finally , one needs a seating reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : you rise in the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; .
at the test customers a button becomes the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train managers get a message on their mobile devices , that the pass@@ ast X has been in the train and has been taken in the Y @-@ booked seat Y .
comes the traction manager at the ticket control to place Y know that there is a passenger with already de@@ x@@ rated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , keep on hand , let alone .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which , in turn , should use the passengers .
&quot; who would like to travel without ticket control through our train accompanied personnel , check out in the DB Navigator software itself .
this allows the passengers to organise their travel time in the train of personal data , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Hau@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often moves , knows that in addition to delays and pas@@ ing the driving controls are one of the biggest mess@@ engers .
because often you have , in any case one of the fellow travelers do not have all documents necessary for the demo@@ li@@ tion of online tickets .
either a credit card or a ID card or else is a document that needs to be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train@@ ee directors and traction , which leads to bad mood in part or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and takes the head at the end the time to care for other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is just available at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other traction numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City sat in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year old child and it still is on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else had posted the information on their Fe@@ ed , closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly stored on her tim@@ eline .
the ap@@ pers from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live in T@@ wee@@ ten .
he po@@ ked a picture of Brow@@ ns a mere body that was stretched out on the street and would stay four hours there .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at herself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she completed her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were pictures of the police band and people who shou@@ ted , and by a man who asser@@ ted to be Brow@@ n@@ ay &apos;s father who carried a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live fe@@ ather , with which a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog .
in another video , she said , taken another poli@@ cem@@ an his rif@@ le and crying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell recall their statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to ourselves and which we can call typical &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ t fro@@ st .
I was angry and crying . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years using Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , brought to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have to know it and see it and be educated at it .
it has to be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she is personally experienced no cl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women .
I feel I would show her a bad service to keep away from it . &quot;
the first station when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charged of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on to demonstrators .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell shape began to be assumed .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri Saint Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her camera , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to just wanted to document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or do you have to find a story that you can utilize ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of white - in a community benef@@ itted from their pain and her resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area who is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt Bo@@ assen .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other natives , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people will be presented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but a community who comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of fer@@ ells life as she mar@@ ry herself and her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain viol@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is played history the role of black gay women in the broader black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter @-@ movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who according to the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 influenced the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as pregnant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , sw@@ ule women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , s@@ ule women must wear the burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel your energy by the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras have long gone away in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area they call her home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
however , they cl@@ inging to a song and it feels bound to this memory since it passed three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south side of the pedestrian prec@@ inct spl@@ its since the first presentation 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold lets the subject hardly be one .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic will be discussed .
while one can say one to the bit &apos; gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; that would be real class &quot; ( Nicole swing ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi tab@@ s ) or simply simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while supporters rely on that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , from which the rest of the stores will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
added : the gallery is designed exactly on the property , on which the farm market hall stands , in which 13 direct market @-@ market their products .
with the start of construction work , it will be the conclusion .
the gallery @-@ creators want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and at the Be@@ da square with a possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost a week in the farm hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always very happy .
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market @-@ market in a market hall in the gallery moved to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is likely not to be low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ or or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you see , however , how many shop@@ pers stop here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent market place , it is all the more important to us at least get the marke@@ th@@ all .
after all , the merchandise offered here is fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is ob@@ ser@@ purely inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are located at a shopping center only from larger companies , because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what still remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farm@@ houses throughout the building time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - also in duration when the bit @-@ gallery will eventually come .
or does it make the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery before exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will simply not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping centre , which stands empty , does not need any one .
in my view , it would have been better to make a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farm market hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no more space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the peasant hall is sm@@ ashed , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous - hanging on the cables of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ings and hair cuts that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ go@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st did a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after being translated as secret diplomatic messages about the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called a becoming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and pioneering discrimination , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been driven by the quick@@ ening analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and from the 30 portraits , as someone with these genom@@ ic data could look like , the many mod@@ alities as they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but was openly discussed since her pu@@ ber@@ ty over the identification as a woman was sentenced to 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ y @-@ law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one single picture - a bas@@ al , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ ter inf@@ ant - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 @-@ Project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ ian arti@@ facts like cigarette ch@@ ain@@ es and che@@ wing g@@ um by extracts the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time they received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in jail and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time , and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were reported to dis@@ similar brie@@ fs , which were inter@@ changeable with several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Support Images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ ty &apos;s judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was asked for seven brutal years in a military attack in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of compli@@ ment@@ arity .
there is also now in the opening of the exhibition some depth and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et ways to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that things happen to happen in a certain reason . &quot;
in a wall shown on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with her superior signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is attached with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been sex , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ ochon@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written a jack of Cs and Gs and As , in pen@@ cil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , such as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological way , all of us are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take , is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own space , is a page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing how they appear with a release sha@@ king in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ar of the United States like King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they question your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote me , &quot; said the artist , who salute from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am still getting ge@@ looking , when I speak about it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was pres@@ cient in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from its own genom@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ls who meet like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pose@@ ful as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ gers were written using pen@@ cil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to be like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also hidden behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford in search of killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t issued due to murder on his alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the capital of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several bul@@ ls died .
one from the police authority of Chicago published non @-@ resident warning system states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim to several violations of his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the spot of the event for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives study the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ed , Vice Chairman of the University of Hamburg , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had to be rus@@ hed and excluded from the entry of the North@@ western University of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is being investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ an .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every imagin@@ able way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asser@@ tion added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
Chief Communications Officer at the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to address the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and war@@ ts were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) .
&quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap has been updated in this respect , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the W@@ ada plan to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ enforcement of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could give rise to Russia occasion .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria specified in the list is that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported findings of the approved investigation by the W@@ ada lawyer @-@ approved investigation in Russian sport .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has gotten a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state schemes and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ine@@ ties unite with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has asked to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the W@@ ada of the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main meeting of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ AD@@ A moved in the right direction , &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sold no eggs for more
this shared the company groups .
it is a pure precaution , it could further be assumed by no health draw@@ ment , it says in the communication .
from now on , only eggs are expected to be delivered to Al@@ di who have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ du@@ b@@ lasting anti @-@ le@@ vers .
Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your business will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure your luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you neglect anonym@@ ity some workers would not waste the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said En@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has brought people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on increase in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to provide surveys , speci@@ fying groups and demographic hot@@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to byp@@ ass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software company analytics tools is used to compete employees .
explan@@ atory said that she gives a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of particular teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill up , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , which has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of exposure to those who have spoken , punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth 2020 , according to the SP@@ z@@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ tible , the company helps to prevent the bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ tible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible company leaves tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth card of your problem areas .
there is also an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employee can report a bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ tible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his employees beha@@ ved poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ations and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has been employed Conver@@ tible for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
sooner if a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
well , since the company conver@@ tible up , can have problems , the previously employed by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ flu@@ ent tra@@ ine@@ es@@ - quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employees engagement in 2002 to take seriously after the accounting standards Arthur Andersen had collap@@ sed by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that companies realized that you did not prevent their fil@@ thy laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors , which both have supported start @-@ ups .
conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz secured $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and carried out his entire funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff are more expecting their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stakes .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth it , and that the work that you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , who used both Conver@@ ting and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies are well running . companies are going well when employees work and are engaged .
when the analytics tools rely on third parties , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on staff engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company can not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can cultivate the dis@@ appointments and will be inc@@ ited .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ lic@@ as International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed on collecting data too much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really belong to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported , so re@@ tt .
and after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , she was able to re@@ organise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high sales rates .
&quot; if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
there is at 11.@@ 00 p.m. , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are talking to the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot segments and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses will return to their final test , before returning next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became the Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training session of the U@@ CL@@ A around 19 : 15 will start to meet the already completed tim@@ pl@@ ings of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the bro@@ ins moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood were able to practice practical exercises .
they should hold down in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal pro@@ vision@@ ing preparations for her pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the player &apos;s busi@@ est routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ id themselves further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we are coming to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is finished , what given the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent parking space and the bor@@ dering som@@ kin Center , a hotel being built already with foot@@ rests , which will be a protective line behind a tor@@ p@@ fo@@ sten , no easy task .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjust it to an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not worried about this because of that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts on the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles containing counter@@ fe@@ edings of third parties and show their results under the original input then , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical engineering methods to detect possible mis@@ messages and to send it to fac@@ t@@ inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact testing from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters were flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan , according to social media networks , if not succ@@ eeds , h@@ asser@@ ed post@@ ings as before the elections held there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate explanation in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; besides knowledge , what stories of fact @-@ audi@@ ted third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the article &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 3 years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a cosmopolitan area of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he said we@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he was un@@ expec@@ tedly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the th@@ umb @-@ pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is its th@@ umb @-@ print !
and letters always smells of smoke , because at that time one lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if it were itself also .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who has been struck with old Pap@@ ers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ judged my welcome @-@ du@@ g a little &quot; ) it all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to examine the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the Mongo@@ lian hybrid heads hang on the walls and the bottles spent over the centuries .
he mig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scap@@ ers , gardening , and sometimes with the artists working in the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what you possessed : &quot; you might think that land conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let everything go his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on the broader base into the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm level of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a revol@@ t , who entered the castle in 13@@ 80 in this book , with the title &apos; King of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes .
&quot; the farm began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos;@@ The Pri@@ est &apos; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it &apos;s painter , hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years long during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , represented in which the s@@ mug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed out from the 18th century by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be called ga@@ un@@ er , getting back debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solve their debt crisis by getting rich old women married , I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise themselves . &quot;
after the end of his efforts at the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experience
he has put a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ per@@ män@@ ners behind it , the grounds of a san@@ atorium on the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unvei@@ ling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday has started its campaign for the introduction of a new Dach@@ stein ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
till Thursday mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will want to hold Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ thor@@ ny chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really think , write it on their previously un@@ folded website .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we believe that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the action , it will go more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ reaching promise , one which gives the city a unique unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is standing up in the competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount will be the city of Bad Honnef their new Dach@@ stein and the Camp@@ a@@ ign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdogan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in the beginning of August consul@@ ts in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) over Pen@@ sion@@ ists and Coun@@ ts in Official Off@@ icers .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the prime minister .
under the presidency of the Heads of Government now the five Vice @-@ Presidents and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs and Foreign Relations .
with that , the civilians were in the Y@@ as &apos; figures .
the government is drawing up the bree@@ der in the military .
Chief of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy have been ab@@ duc@@ ted .
since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdogan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdogan as a wire of the put@@ sch .
against 4@@ 86 people , which should have been involved immediately in the coup attempt at Ankara won in Ankara in this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the put@@ sch , Erdogan was alleged to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really get a grip on ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the head@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general rule there are concerns for a growing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which among other things manifes@@ ts in the repe@@ al of the head bot@@ s for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least the large cleaner in the army and the security guards goes on .
in the middle of July Erdogan passed by decree of more 73@@ 95 G@@ ear@@ ners , including 2@@ 303 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
so it seemed as if Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual men of the country .
three times , they had a appeal on their role as a gu@@ ardian of the secular state order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan was crow@@ ding the power of the military step by step , not least among appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers say Erdogan is targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; a specially @-@ mentioned officer sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such development might not be cold .
in any case , there is no doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplomats said .
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees to lower the legal immigrants in 50,000 a year to lower stric@@ ter rules on granting vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restriction for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by changing the way the United States will be able to change the way citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will come to candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ ship route for race climb
over the past few months the race of the race must be disputed at the beginning of the race - now it is going to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ oon , on which the tourist railway drives , built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure the future of the race peaks in the long term , we will start building work on the route by the traffic Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ship Il@@ men@@ au race tracks , the country is familiar to this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic @-@ State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l am Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the maintenance of the track was about 2.5 million Euros .
of this sum , the land take 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will be final at this time , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railways as the operator have already been agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the roadmap to use the vehicles used and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
at that time the racing shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the racing car @-@ shuttle is one especially popular rail link between stations Il@@ men@@ au and racing at the race .
during the course of a pilot company , during the course of a pilot plant , the track has been used by sufficient many people to order it again in the future .
the track is also heavily b@@ illed in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just as you thought it could not be crazy , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot@@ ics within the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , cem@@ ented Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are funny about it , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silic@@ on skin that feels warm to the touch - with aware of human reactions obtained by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and choose everything , from the eye @-@ colour of the robot on the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is more worrying because many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that would be a step@@ per woman to be progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they can be appealing as for example , in the future .
and then there still the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gave the impression of relap@@ sing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an adventurous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adventurous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; black@@ ness the website of True Arm@@ ion .
so you may like what you like and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fix@@ ated on conversation or they can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot@@ ic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ stated female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions on rape once you go one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : disgu@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , inv@@ enting one most .
on his website the True Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy synthes@@ ized with a Vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; when women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation in something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will naturally not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R noted its increasing popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ates from the boundary zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or abu@@ sive until they give the free market permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ ision that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the women &apos;s rights are threatened by women in which the White House has a president to have pra@@ wn women sexually .
the most intimi@@ est aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the mu@@ ddy body and the spread @-@ out eyes but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they will im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they do not have mediation or background history , nothing that implies on independence or anything , which could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words : they are fake slaves .
or in order to express it in the phrase @-@ wise of 2017 :
Tr@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a t@@ amp@@ on of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , have split their families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest festival in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with horror from Tr@@ ump &apos;s relatives .
we are all supposedly attached to our fil@@ bl@@ isters .
less noticed the power of ho@@ umps , families to bring together .
I chose this , because my c@@ ousin , a centre @-@ directed de@@ chter@@ in who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with re@@ public@@ ans in our family , this week has visited me in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls within another context that this will also bring considerable risks .
the left was reinforced by Tr@@ ump , but the horri@@ fying effect of his presidency has the force to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we relate to the grosser way that some day will no longer turn off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , a long @-@ long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the tr@@ ump of re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as a by@@ term of denial .
I find myself nowadays of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which looked at 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both occur compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of re@@ public@@ ans must only be mentally , in order to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousine in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell at Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ us@@ ells of the New York Park@@ our , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if there is no caffeine .
the horses are huge , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals turn to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and clim@@ atic music conv@@ eys this in a strange way .
so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city shall not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 years to go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before using my credit card .
at the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to tip the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ usable while I was tired of having experienced my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ or@@ us was reloc@@ ated to the hospital by Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us
Pist@@ or@@ us had the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was transferred to hospital after the treatment of s@@ lei@@ gh to his hand@@ wr@@ ists , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ or@@ us was condemned by murder of an appeal for the first tot@@ als after a call of prosec@@ ut@@ ors .

as a farmer , Arnold was able to find a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the four @-@ cler@@ ics from F@@ itt@@ arius and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the leading schools .
three of the kidn@@ apping in the future also extend to the gymn@@ asium , four to the Real@@ school .
Schul@@ kl@@ ist Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine is a young eagle which grew up in the chicken yard , but then release them into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this led the m@@ ist Sh@@ ar a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle at Ch@@ icken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and let it hat@@ s off his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken dish , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken made from him , sm@@ ote , the eagle on a high mountain stretch his wings out and ent@@ win@@ ed .
afterwards the classes showed three and four in the classification of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ linders were wearing to the bet .
the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te .
the young was indeed different from the other kittens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished to wish everyone a quadru@@ pe@@ er that he feels accepted in his new school .
the acceptance was followed by the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again jumps at the time of teaching and the parents &apos; representatives .
the kitchen @-@ time is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she leave her students after two years of lessons very much , because it was a really great time .
after all , they can rely on the qu@@ ay .
at the end , all students put a song of summer@@ time and holiday season .
thereby the children broke out great pleasure .
the new school year is already registered for the new school year .

on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally celebrated people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , while an investigation is currently running .
the State Department reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial bills .

software update for diesel cars : what the people affected now need to know
how accurate does the software update take place ?
should diesel @-@ drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of the emission classes 5 and partially euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car Club Europa are invaluable :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates have been considered only for the vehicles , the che@@ ers software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an excellent transp@@ osition into the coming months , but not yet called a exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be completed in their frame .
how long should the re@@ armament take place altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
it depends on the commitment of the producers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , we voluntarily act on the issue of the car manufacturers on the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the re @-@ conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming might be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do , who don &apos;t drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would rep@@ el , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
now is a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but , in the regions where the b@@ inger is threatening .
in rural areas , there has so far been no losses for older diesel .

we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
since 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
and the work is still great fun as he is taught in the press .
he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time wondered , that so far no application has given the application profile .
the city is currently looking for an architect or engineer at next time .
thus , taking into consideration the regular notice of notice is still enough time for a review .
da Has@@ lach was in charge of the Board of Directors as a sub@@ contracting authority , the applicant has to assign author@@ is@@ sions .
because this function wants to keep the city anyway .
if they cannot fill in them any longer , people would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity of the city and itself is important , &quot; says W@@ acker , who reported by a good working atmosphere , as well as good mood between authority and citizen .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have been accumulated , the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life @-@ value , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the Low @-@ car park are about .
the zig@@ z@@ ties between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium is still the issue .
the latter will strike with around 1.5 million Euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; don &apos;t appreciate .
&quot; all in all are great tasks for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
st@@ on@@ ent is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of great man@@ oeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gardening shop , much flexible can be re@@ acted .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green systems will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands as an ensemble with monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye for what it fits , when re@@ constructions are approved , stresses the cra@@ y@@ est Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ man bears high responsibility .
he is a farmer , &quot; in the end everything works here over my table . &quot;
for the support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( High @-@ construction ) has been present at Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) for fifteen years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor is long left , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like Roland W@@ acker in order to obtain information from the City of Has@@ lach a completed study as a diplom@@ at or bach@@ elor with subject area architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and building planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt , underground and deep construction , construction planning , re@@ under@@ growth , administration of urban renewal , municipal operating courtyard with construction and municipal ten@@ ure , as well as under@@ mining authority , including monument protection .
bike on lines thrown : southern direction locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the Le@@ ob@@ ased Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the leader@@ ships .
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching Gü@@ ler had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male birds and look for the night hours after them .
close to the scene there were witnesses of a ros@@ li@@ fter roll@@ er@@ - and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ stre@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A .
the perpetrators brought themselves in great danger and are also jeop@@ ardis@@ ed with traction traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the municipal and the delay , and the cost of rail transport , there could also be a don@@ or of the railway @-@ customers to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be excluded , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south @-@ ground route could be led without disabilities .
almost ten persons of persons were Friday morning , two of them consider the correspondence .
freight trains were not falling off , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 metres of over@@ lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel motion )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition associated in the US about 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom is causing stomach @-@ war@@ ms and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid mol@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure the detri@@ mental micro@@ bes that are hidden in the food , do not penetrate into the body .
cells , which are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue .
when the equilibrium gets too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result of a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance are con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve immune cell on mice , which bear a particular bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel , if the same system is also associated with people .
the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study remedies had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but which had not been separated .
you suspect that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the di@@ sen@@ me of mice have been DNA sequences and it were found six bacterial species , that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them l@@ acked with the mice .
mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they didn &apos;t developed this type of immune cells , and they were developed by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria turned out into the immune system , the researchers led by L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquids - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerant @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an i@@ dol 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ harm@@ ation were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased around half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in men as with mice , but def@@ ective in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells manage inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ harm@@ ation can result in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to increase this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 40 million pounds of Sig@@ nature started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup start out against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the semi@@ de role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , MAT@@ IC was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only abol@@ ished 45 minutes , which leads to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started in Avi@@ va &apos;s stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his starting @-@ XI for the start of the season .

&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier when they get four of four for me , but they have put great efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

new freezing for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , S &amp; D Group Prime Minister had always been with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no stur@@ geon fire from the party central , merely no counter@@ wind from the federal government - it was the most important wish of the fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed radically .
since then , the members of the Willy Brandt , Willy Brandt , are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Mr Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ wind not even described in the approach .
there were depression .
and one by one after another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looks at the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Green . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprisingly frac@@ tion@@ ation of a Green MEPs over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ operator Michael Kellner has requested the ab@@ stain @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ ops urged to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear conce@@ al@@ ment of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the federal executive guide and election campaigns of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must all be not true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD vote , as Friday morning the new hi@@ obs@@ cur@@ ity reaches the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands by the super@@ step of the green S El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and nobody knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected strong defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades at the time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the elections @-@ elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was what it became though - and it was all significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the hands @-@ up , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te balance the party .
lab@@ orious r@@ app@@ ra@@ ged the comrades in the weeks after that time again .
then , when they had straight new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next strongh@@ old .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burning .
and because he did pretty much anything wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister had already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese de@@ valu@@ ated values came to be added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of course , Wei@@ l tried to set up more and more in recent weeks , in the Bund acc@@ ents .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover to develop his power in Berlin , as well as comrades in the context of Martin Schulz was not conce@@ aled .
they let him grant him because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could arise .
the Wei@@ l in the party &apos;s internal obligation is at the bottom no fault .
and Mr Schulz does not at all .
at times the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
your anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the Fourth parliament@@ arians T@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets puts their own career entran@@ ts on the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the Party left in the German Bundestag faction , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
MS T@@ west has not been elected because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on members continues .
the logical consequence would be that they have res@@ igned their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the German Bundestag faction , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as top @-@ did@@ acy to the Bundest@@ ags election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs are adul@@ ter@@ ated the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann .
he requested the background to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or more we have given further commitments by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding Award for Ort@@ k@@ ern III
anyone who wants to put his into a house in the years may soon get assistance from the country .
he informed the mayor of Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a look back on the subject .
since 1991 there has been present in delicate re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has yet taken two thirds of the funding .
in the restoration zone II from 2005 to 2016 the grant was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to also advance the interior design , and not only opening new areas of construction .
on April 4th you received the information from the Res@@ cue Karlsruhe , Germany , that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III .
the funding will amount of 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euros , of which more than 500 000 Euro were received from the country , the rest of the church .
how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to explore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role whether in the planned territory to do in general interest .
if necessary , the area limits could then also be postponed .
the jet@@ ty on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is about per property .
the refurb@@ ishment region would eventually be defined as a company by stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 , until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , the survey will be conducted once again , within the framework of those involved in the san@@ itation @-@ area to fill out a questionnaire to fill out .
in November or December , the statutes of the statutes shall be made possible , so that the next year will begin with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , subsequently , explained that any Commun@@ e must perform the predicted preliminary examinations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about to evaluate and decide the urban abnorm@@ alities and decide when it will be judged and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the respective property there will also be a refurb@@ ishment in the basic book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , again , will come again and get a picture of the situation , promised them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property owner , &quot; where among other things , it comes to construc@@ tional state and refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ se@@ - and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oper@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to fill only when in building business areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wind@@ dog ration@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function@@ alities - who comes first , gr@@ ats first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there can be no funding schemes for later &quot; reserve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors are using a micro@@ chip to get along with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he may open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between Th@@ umbs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory service team at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed after medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro @-@ chi@@ pped and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra fee of £ 300 per castle .

the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event that suspen@@ ds American production last month , tax@@ payers are left up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice Chairman of Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ters in Connecticut , was exhibited in addition to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I wanted to be aware that you are aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the deputy @-@ commander of aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 PM and remained so long , until the lawn was left between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the hours a second team for the flight back would need .
the original flight unit was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel in the unit remained on the floor during the time .
the records provided by the T@@ IME did not indicate if ultimately a second flight level was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked if the event could inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform , which was on the Senate in the Senate and the efforts for cur@@ v@@ ature of government regulations .
the use of the airplane that is known as marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous uses is hardly a new phenomenon .
presidents are required to use them for the journey .
however , to request their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced a study in February than the presidential jet prior to the background of his first camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that claims about the use of the presidential jet through its predecessors .
&quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states represented by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ crew often conduct training trips in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to expose the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ eliness .
as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted in the White House 58 practice land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event included in the training needs of the air@@ planes for the month , said a be@@ amer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ payers were not taking the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in setting the helicop@@ ters at the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have a budget for the presidential term , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D reimbur@@ sement for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour @-@ hour .
records of the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs of tax@@ payers to set the tax on the basis of the estimates for revenues is most mis@@ leading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the revenues for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former press review of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ru@@ es , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spi@@ š . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state , Connecticut are proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
of course it is reasonable to highlight . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump joined with helicop@@ ters , when he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss is a tricky task
leaders of the 2nd tennis Bundesliga compete in the standings in the standings .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel near the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ point Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite the five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er record , the leaders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of the reality .
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team , which is always in a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ ess S@@ V the Im@@ ports from the Far North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strongly in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view on Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ irs and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will be as always hard for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good and good fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be max@@ im jan@@ ju@@ four .
at the moment , the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not manage to Bundesliga game , comes with the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c spiel@@ ende Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .
the Un@@ defeated Ch@@ il@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was still alive with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the ball in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should be in Kiel , but as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ool , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday for the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z would again move again into the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the j@@ uni@@ ors world in January 2016 , one does not fill anyone out of the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy did Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he put his signature on Wednesday evening his signature , under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his du@@ ast to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress has packed a few &quot; constitutional provisions . &quot;
also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US initiative .
after all , the design seems to pun@@ ish European businesses that will help Russians to pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the domestic O@@ MV are concerned that jointly with other European companies are co @-@ financed by the Russian East H@@ eit@@ ung North Stream 2 .
the dru@@ pe is tremendous .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even needs to resur@@ rec@@ t the sanctions by executive order to life .
twelve weapons will stand in his election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i C@@ art@@ el is moved into the center of heat from Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is still far from being over .
the season three and four have already been confirmed by streaming services , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ pe of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of the world in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 @-@ Company &quot; only with more governmental functions and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is sanc@@ tified by the Mexican connection , and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published tra@@ ilers Pedro Pascal is returning as Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colombian prosecution , to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ ves@@ tre , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season from Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role down@@ ward : the town presents 46 kitchen@@ ware .
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself again .
with firm contact persons for the children and an assignment .
in the urban kinder@@ gartens , the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban nursery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ gers , acting director in the field of youth , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will continue to be cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this job and supplies fresh cooked food .
the city runs in Kre@@ feld area 46 children &apos;s day@@ care centres , in 44 the children receive a warm meal .
there were $ 2,@@ 800 children last year and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of the 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is valid also in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 2 pm . &quot;
46 sub @-@ periods have heating up from 1 September kitchen service : you warm up the meals , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; employees will be firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ y .
the size - there are two @-@ group , as well as seventh equipment - decides over the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kite @-@ learning to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not continually changing men . &quot;
this continuity is important for the kids .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - is managed by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen cleaning service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has turned out in the cost between auto@@ reg@@ al and foreign sti@@ pulation for the city as the most economic , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ periods are to be reset .
&quot; but these hours drop by around 750 people in the gu@@ ardian area , not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .

GM@@ B concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to be dedicated to managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie for the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company had crossed over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ o location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which places next to other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that staff and trade union officials would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities were changed .
in a letter to the subsidiary of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insisted that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be accelerated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win from General @-@ Site manager not clarity about the financial needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ o , our members are deeply sad@@ dened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have been working here and the workforce concentrate strongly on the local community and the large areas of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and of the chronic production process , at the end of Glasgow , we urgently need a thri@@ ving production method at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ p of T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter of GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union officials .
we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B @-@ representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we operate as all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully . should our factory processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La Liga likes to rep@@ ent your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not let in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after spending an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his free@@ wheel clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago prior to the world revolution .
the sensational approach has tou@@ red the trans@@ verse window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world ch@@ ord to break more than double the previous brand , where Paul Sz@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional athlete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board stands that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this view ?
when Manchester City has been interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded that line , whereby the Spanish club has expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that she would not allow it to leave Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of her price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ Report de@@ ple@@ et Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ Report on the abuse of abuse of the Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ sal sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen will take further discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ser , spokes@@ man of the Reform@@ ismus &quot; We are church , &quot; declared as a bishop of the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep regret of their own mis@@ concep@@ tions or their then false evaluation of the operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence at the cathedral sp@@ ying with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double measurement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , nobody knows that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful action &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; such as the author of Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the day @-@ to @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one would like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with friends , such as I was one , finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to use modern standards for earlier decades as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wron@@ g@@ ly , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger was written &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , he values the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the diocese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 rainbow dom@@ ites were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ ast@@ ering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was held from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it is possible that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied .
especially at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other def@@ endants , many victims reck@@ oned on the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even re@@ connect positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was relie@@ ved of his opinion .
Mr. H@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence of violence , is responsible for the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; and there is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a too many students stand out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who was det@@ ectable by the O@@ f@@ teren when a dom@@ inion has been with no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate as his Bio@@ graph this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you look at the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages , and it is clearly being acqu@@ itted from each suspicion of medi@@ a@@ - or co @-@ failure in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
even the violence of violence at the pres@@ en@@ schule took place outside of its area of efficiency .
you can pret@@ end to hear about it too late or have taken first hint not seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ ar &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the sake of life , was experienced by practically all the respondents - as literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm @-@ hearted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledgeable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who cat@@ ered the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and chocol@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also has led to dis@@ armament .
that he did not only cast with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground but also ear@@ phones and too che@@ ek@@ y guys with@@ ered the hair or ears he has given himself years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it .
in his hon@@ orary capacity , however , it must be said that such educ@@ ative methods were widespread in the questionable period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents such as teachers .
do you also know such breeding techniques ?
naturally , I think everyone of us born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with what this is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , are the certainly dre@@ dging operations .
then you wonder if it was not rather with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed across him .
in the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who never understood him are still eager .
the truth however is : the report relie@@ ves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a great deal was reported on the topic of abuse among the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also laid down in the final report as any implic@@ ation or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted itself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a du@@ cking model for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are left out of shame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a chor@@ us , who would have been a colleague of the offen@@ ders .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger play a role in regard to abuse waste ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a surv@@ eyed student formed it so : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , accepting that expected him ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ unting or more clear or rather open , than in relation to their parents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nat@@ s@@ heads , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that you speak to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to a very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in advance of affected students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be shared by every fellow citizens .
he cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded to him , not to prevent him or have brought it to ad .
that is why there is no reason to relate to his good name with these reluc@@ tance , as unfortunately in some cases happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is pushed forward in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
namely there is clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asium of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report was dealt with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us leader .
all the horrible tick @-@ ped@@ ago@@ gic , cases where l@@ ad of sa@@ w@@ ling teachers were regul@@ ated and mal@@ igned and including horri@@ fic l@@ anders , all occurred at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail .
but with whom the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the field of the spine for the primary school .
on the way , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to escape your escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ ar for the spine ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there were already discipline , but just no di@@ zz@@ ling violence .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims expect the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even re@@ connect positive memories with it . &quot;
so at most still the pro@@ ach , have looked left away .
however , despite all efforts the report could only define two periods , in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was held responsible for the happ@@ enings at a school , which he had just not worked and responsible , ( as the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again in 1993 .
George R@@ atz@@ inger just conce@@ aled the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ ar &apos;s spine , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool continues the test sentence practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before the danger of negative press release he recommended drin@@ kable entry .
this of course was at a time when legal clarity was when testing was also banned in Bavaria or long ago .
before that , it occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows .
that was difficult to estimate for him , where people may perhaps be exaggerated or dramatic , and where the per@@ missible border had been exceeded .
but one can also not say that he had always looked at .
this is simply not true .
the check of schools in Germany was officially abol@@ ished in 1980 .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is unfair to use the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the then time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we have a historian , because of the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past and present of today &apos;s moral measure .
the princess had already right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse that has been ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and also not for what has been broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence at non @-@ school children , which already goes far beyond that time usual .
this is all completely aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so plu@@ gs and ear to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a bodily punishment , it has been strictly forbidden , he was strictly kept in mind .
what picture from his Regen@@ sburger time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was given in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther &quot; Pope . &quot;
was the topic of testing in the language also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI I. , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral @-@ spl@@ its played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not believe that he did a strict regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding an associated discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ ts , true cultural har@@ ass@@ ies of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bondage alone , you do not even make a great singer and face every success , just in what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming themselves .
so what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and in addition I discovered Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really quite well and experienced again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , magical , deep unbelie@@ ving and cordial people , from which one could not imagine that he could also do just a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still get in touch with him today , 23 years after his Em@@ pres@@ tations , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him up to this day , that he once was strictly with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always is a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a very narrow father , certainly , that may be - but still a like@@ able respect person , to which they still look up and honor them .
and please , again , very clearly : all that one casts him are up@@ bringing methods which were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad we have overcome this time a long time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because it is prominent and has an even more prominent brother , to do for the medi@@ al scap@@ e@@ goat .
there is the nasty intent that is behind it , just too obvious .
because the report which was just published , relie@@ ved him .
now the inauguration of the state , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ it , and without Germany would probably no one know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally to make peace in peace .
