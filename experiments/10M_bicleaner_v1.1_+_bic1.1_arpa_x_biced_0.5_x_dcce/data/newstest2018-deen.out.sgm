<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that will change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit-chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the suffocated cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when landcards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to be exciting already because the Auto-Navi had a green meadow instead of a walk-road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geo-Portal (Bavaria) of the state government, are anything but current - but therefore very conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and churches have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered canvas which one recognizes as the same.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large coverage map were collected for cities and municipalities for more detailed cards, so-called urine sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian Vermessing administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipped the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders took part of Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even when the French troops finally relocated to the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were the neighbors today, which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Vermessing administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositilage form for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is as much as possible to find all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison table / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was divided 21 years after creation of the map, thus 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, subsendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower-Spring are concentrated in 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at the Hindoo omen, one petty-click map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written Flurks from the so-called "urine recording," which the basic tax has been derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there today are no more farmers - but small gardenser of the plant" "" "Land of Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is situated north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Showplace of the October Revolution, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the" "" "jungle" "" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen is not only about the street address" "" "at the tavern" "" "or from the ascent" "" "On the ventilation" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the auerfield street you should once have been crowned with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lübeck."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of this psychiatrist, who is being brought to King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the shootation of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibits the personnel to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, first place had been fixed, later on 500 places were extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreiskulturanstalt made in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amplium Munich-East has been one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">The people of the former Auer Anstalt are now meeting people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth-home with training establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings dating from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 the children-house "Casa Don Bosco" - in an architecturistic approach to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the main square, called the Purchase alley.</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were torn in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a pit-chapel from the Middle Ages was once again at the Marienhof, where these days the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn route take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the air-image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rights-rights available for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association zur Förderung der colored has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which will take place until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to leave their journeys by the state and have extreme caution, as a number of fragmentary, racial-based incidents can occur in recent times throughout the state and listed here," it says in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law from Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state, the disproportionate of minorities, prompted the group to release travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they are breaches of civil rights, which are going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are pulled together because of their skin colour, they are collapsed or killed, "the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such an incidence we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist battles against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sander, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, having no gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the office of the Secretary General of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 per cent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring it to" "" "cheery money or" "" "relatives" "" "that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015 Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, following the latest figures from the hate criminal reporting programme of the FBI, which took the state in relation to the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberation Union (ACLU) made travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona, after the states concealed immigration laws to mistrust people because of immigration violations, which, in view of ACLU, will contribute to further development.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel openings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The primary project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherical Women's Hospital is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag, Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided an impression on location.</seg>
<seg id="70">During the Twenched family of Schwendemann met representatives from the Fisherbacher CDU commune together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and also many young animals, and in five apartments Feriengaeste houses.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "black-petting milk" is for him of an Alternative wiring way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV-president of Fisherbach, he is called the" "" "elementary project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't manage up on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space care for a lot of work, much must be handled with the motorsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and with topography," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental factory and run this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not conduct a bioeconomy.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "the Commune was clear to Mayor Thomas Schneider:" "" "the Commune recognised the importance of the" "" "primary project" "" "and is happy about the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, the farmers need to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the forestation of areas could be moved still quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure that we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure space is thus 40 hectares, which can not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euro, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter took place in the village of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus they resale the farmers 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Even for Peter Weiss stood firm: "here the best food products are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state-of-the-country support of the Weidetenunen.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">A requirement is the presence of one of the LPR-drawn conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "in addition, the surface area must not be disastrous (Hangaversion over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with forestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherical Adult project 2018, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the cost-calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firm Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic insax in a hitry dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of President on the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller is not turning the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-infiltrators would have acted to it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta described, "I don't want to go down here for a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly accurate, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your exhausted, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who long for you to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not become involved in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict regarding the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that it took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by demonstrating in an unused classical imaging representation the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem, the feminine figure is no longer abstractions - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people of the right wing want to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry for the rush of Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty Is not a one, but rather an early Neoconservative that bring the American flame into the reinstated world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something encountered.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely at all a question of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective, the Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the way but hate the hatred, who is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black Brackable members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembered a time when only two carrots were included in the United Kingdom's team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the power-director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent on the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special" developed "and the athletics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue until we find it," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that something has to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete thinks it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butonchart - who were to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m trail, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen by the team to team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her surrender was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were strantically or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling the Eilim got quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of silver Medal winning a winning player, which is competing at the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 notes are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total score at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance Muir leads on this path and last year has put five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take to the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1.500 m running, is another Scottish, which one was able to observe the victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannitters surrender states that they are "enormously" "to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and in the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"to be special about team captain, is that it was a great honour from other members of the team, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and have chosen to make it very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "I am obviously very proud of all the strels that are part of the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And here they are the established athletes, athletes who want to get off podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion again.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's gonna be just such a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: throw yourself not a public office, if you cannot tolerate the inserts of the voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it didn't take long before the newspapers clave him because of all, from home policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He was ashamed of the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and wordless, we are led by the sheep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This leads me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's staff have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Defence Union defendant him this week earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The neab governor made the lawsuit as frivol, and the online-comment had been full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest-highest approval of the fifty governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">"" "" "" "he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles." ""</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haunless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of individuals who come to the Board of Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans speaker in Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of dry or spammers or hasserance people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawgitin Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, MD., was not hassertive, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I was very polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news," "" "wrote them in the commentary volume of the message" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate that idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are disrespected by some rather than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of people concerned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "as well as the governors of the governors as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "", "others would probably call" "" "interpronunciation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it simple to trim a message by simply blocks a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff has been sent to collect newspapers with critical notes and burn or to burn demonstrators and to bring silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticized that he impacted Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users, which were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County is the first Amendment, according to the U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as they represented a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">In time Washington's time had a similar impact on the Internet at an affordable port.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous envelope to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington was anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudo-me such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters of newspapers that Washington's decisions made.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with the United Kingdom, came his office, according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced them.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumbes on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 o'clock to a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hilarius system a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit of charity can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of the Tumliners.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stressed: "it is a unique village of village."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariusory was first mentioned in Baden-Distribution Book, Count Hermann von Sulz and the Vogtei "by Magister Eberhard by Horb and at his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, the tumor mountain apart from the erstwhile parish church is also a glorious court which belonged to the church or the patron law and is not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf that is now still visible today in the outskirts of Tumbes, the "mountain" of the village, the Sovereign settler of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old cards from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patron saint arose from the early medieval Fear-law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord who built a church, and occupied with a pastor, continued to have owner of this church, and could also inherit this church church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a bishop a new parish.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The biggest of the two crust at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created Glocke was then first 1692, but had to be handed over in 1942 for the first time in World War II.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows of windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was impermeable.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 stormed French troops near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church died in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting-place for the dead from hearers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuschurch broke off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the Kirchturm let you stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year 1834 a storm turned the Kirchturm and the half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent a disaster, the tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower used today remained as a witness of the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are maintaining the "creative retirees" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers invite friends and sponsors of Tumlinens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unhindered expenses of the European football matches will not disturb Neymars world chord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA still, because the leading organisation which oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules which were launched in 2011 by UEFA launched, mean that PSG should eventually prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to pick the Brazilians from his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure the money is easy, so Neymar signs and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy of the rich mistress family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may apply for the acquisition of players a lot of money, but need to take control with legitimate income sources, which allow the break-even point in relation to football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini in his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations, who had taken tremendous debt in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and riskied to ruin, if banks or owners returned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP ranked on the debt of the clubs for monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which used the novel Abramovich, originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then powerfully invested to improve the crew and build a global brand - become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini's 2015 is fallen by the presidency in the ingnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat fee, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year treaty, so that waste-solvents can be expelled from 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG was given a penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remained limited.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to list their supervisors by offering their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could not exceed the PSG if the value of sponsoring the standard market rates should exceed the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA was charged by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG Payments to Jymar will be made over payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Championship in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">However, PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar Cup assadors will be assadors and that such a maneuver could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will still be more attentive to adhere to rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG over Neymars Transfer, announcing the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In the last published reports, PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrive a boon for sponsorship's Deals, merchandising and tricot.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent neymars forge by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" co-financing "with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last resort to PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger whose association is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a state which finances an association.</seg>

<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers another kind of nostalgia: at the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "Glow" with his East-West-West Bank Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy produced by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created a found TV series with Rhys Thomas: a Romanian Drama of the 1980's, with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The protagonist - a hard-ottener Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogs of channing Tatum (also an extensive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English are synced.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask, is involved - that it is often played like a single one.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The great life living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment in a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square footage was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom estate with a scraped layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, they commissioned the Architekture- und Designstudio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that make 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for yoanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so the architectural challenge in it consisted of creating a mezzanine with which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked out, without having to decorate them.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Not only did it go to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement granted it Erfan, to place two rooms in full, with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine can look down a classic clutch window from Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold-furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him last longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the spreadsheet feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding tables are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a wardrobe door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering was done," Erfan explains from the steel strengthened, furious MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is contradictory, so that if you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne additional 16 m ² gain, one extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will be selling the basic space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate broker can enter and can perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can turn out of a good design and increased square footage of some standards even in a little amazement.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave this not.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the head on a more equitable course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawkins:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with executive staff, he was a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he fixed: poor information that came into the hands of the President.</seg>

<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television last decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate was upset due to an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were persuasive," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to hold Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign in it to ensure his personal media consumption has a steady lobster."</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officers know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets have not included any more spark-fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never hear anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a few times, aggravation of it away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no-one has consistently prevented it that trump controversies derives.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house that advocates from competed parties, always try to move their own agenda by presenting Trump Material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this history - reported in May about the anticipation of the consultants, the President of strategic reasons, to provide doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leakks, and that he will find out to find out where these come.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone had accused a printed copy of an article by Gotic .com, the website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, which accused the Deputy Commander-in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a pile to be from Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Though Johnson was relegated from Twitter because of straps, or that he has no specific evidence or has revoiced wrong allegations in the past and revoke it.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly strives to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Maybe he is prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice-plate is at stress and can be disrupted in case of a keyhole, a piece of pout.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt from Schelfeis and iceberg increases the sea level, as it can float on the water and ice cold as much water as it comes after the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of shame leads to that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in low dimensions, the British research project writes to observation of the Antarctica (MIDAS).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is according to AWI-statements with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth largest chilifeis of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the end of the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of the direct connection with climate change, the icesign comes now into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>

<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers will not go back to climate change, this gigantic iceberg will not fall back on climate change, so in the past few decades, many icebergs of the Antarctic peninsula are smashed.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long dial in the Antarctica covers the direction of South America.</seg>

<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach already.</seg>

<seg id="1570">Yet Klaus-Dieter People, Leader of the CDU, goes beyond the same application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was tapped already in the creistag for a lazy surprise when he publicly asked human resources and was startled by the other parties.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Sitting in the future sport-stars in future before computer consoles, instead of sweating out to fight with wind and weather over the stadium?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious branch, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also identified the first Bundesligadas, which are increasingly being engaged in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is safe to need.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobous has long been faced with the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne is e-sport a sport because it is Competitive and contains a lot of biological and physical responses, which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Furthermore, there are cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capability.</seg>

<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.</seg>

<seg id="1752">The BMW Chairman said, the company is of the opinion that "there is smarter options as travel restrictions," and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described businesses as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides, the diesel engines, are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, plant equipment to neutralising the exhaust gases to be installed, also take too what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful trading companies and ignore signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, to regulate the use of so-called isolation devices that could be adjusted to comply with emissions when a car has been tested, but go back to normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several employees have been indicted by Volkswagen, others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics of Audi was arrested in Germany in the automobile development of Audi.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed the emission standards in Europe, and a request that has been concentrated on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could load Volkswagen heavily: the luxury car manufacturer has over disproportionately to the benefit of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet in Wednesdays to review their plans for the recent chaos in the State Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discussed what feels more secure: they should take their children to office, who were in 2009 the target of an attack with grenades, or they leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal numeric.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspects on the government list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite of violence, and throughout the country the bodies of corpses, are always more journalists at the same time: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012. 589 are based on attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is its editors and her inspirer from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be reporter," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence in the context of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence is felt deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which indicates his mid-finger with the word "Justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, tee t-shirts, who exhibit his smiling face with spectacles or its typical Panamanian truth.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discussed their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder-Federal Office was established in 2010, in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it was introduced by the committee to protect journalists by only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders who are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist that the violence of Sinaloa must be treated, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more conical.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting in discussion of security has little value, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to squander my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know, mistrust us all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was shot of two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot to him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelter river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The swearcher was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of executed, two-story mouse oleto for drug addictions, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace," if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he has broken his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first, in February the publication of a interviews with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling carton in the war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release might have annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue once they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was that Valdez has not been forced to force Valdez after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killings is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues thinks he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined together with five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism, without encountering an anti-dowry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper has earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and the revenues and publicity took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious' Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize 'for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in view of so many things... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a longshoreman, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">It would always go to El Guayanabo, the bar opposite the office, go and always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well, they ask, was his love of the routine of his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how to best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it when you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny and runways to get drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smelling wrong, b away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days previously it became known that Spyware is sold exclusively to governments, for the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside they sought two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, the governor itself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It's been a few months since the reporter moved to the mountain landscape, where the drug-gangs are de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has engraved on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the State expenditures, focusing on the hometown of the governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the Office of the Public Prosecution, a abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug makers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the ruling institutional revolution party (Pri) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri governors were accused of high-containing cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal begged the reporters to write about previous events in this pub, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was deprived of military emergency.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez defying the authorities, journalists pronounce and release them, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has been asked for ever since it has been divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in joining the government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug persons but also on the command of politicians and security guards which coincided with organized crime among a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little with the eyes blind, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main writer Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa's dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbal eater, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably of meat eating dinosaurs has been threatened.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as a counter-protection, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mingle better in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature made from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and it is Borealopelta distinctive with the Museum technology Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astounding maintenance of copies offered it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors through his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaking, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the countermove is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure carried out by meat uniting dinosaurs has been hunted that evolution favoured the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the counter-attire - think of deer, zebras, or puppets - are much smaller and hurtful as prey, which signaled that this Nodosauger was suspended to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous have to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was maroon.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including his fourth performer to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died, pushed into a river and went out into the sea where he sank to the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with contempt skin, but also in three dimensions remains preserved and the original form of the animal is attached," said Brown.</seg>

<seg id="1976">On the exact number of recent weeks, there are no information provided.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is light to medium-serious injury, said a polzeal precher.</seg>
<seg id="1978">There was a big entrance to rescue vehicles at the accident point.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again: absolutely insults is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are widening in his work and just has an ingenious thought.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn commits the creator control at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm via mobile phone that you have taken his seat and devaluated the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test run runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"the offer is offered, we extend it out.</seg>

<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the app, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally, one needs a seating reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works so: you rise in the train, calls his ticket to "My Tickets".</seg>
<seg id="2004">At the test customers a button becomes the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train managers get a message on their mobile devices, that the passast X has been in the train and has been taken in the Y-booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the traction manager at the ticket control to place Y know that there is a passenger with already dexrated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So one can continue to sleep, keep on hand, let alone.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which, in turn, should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who would like to travel without ticket control through our train accompanied personnel, check out in the DB Navigator software itself.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Who often moves, knows that in addition to delays and pasing the driving controls are one of the biggest messengers.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case one of the fellow travelers do not have all documents necessary for the demolition of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either a credit card or a ID card or else is a document that needs to be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between trainee directors and traction, which leads to bad mood in part or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and takes the head at the end the time to care for other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is just available at the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2027">He poked a picture of Browns a mere body that was stretched out on the street and would stay four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell at herself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She completed her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweet over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were pictures of the police band and people who shouted, and by a man who asserted to be Brownay's father who carried a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feather, with which a policeman was standing in front of a group of protesters with a rebellious dog.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years using Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, brought to Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which they had countless times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived at Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charged of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on to demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2091">Cold lets the subject hardly be one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one can say one to the bit 'gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "that would be real class" (Nicole swing), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi tabs) or simply simply: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While supporters rely on that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, from which the rest of the stores will benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precinct.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - hanging on the cables of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupings and hair cuts that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Legoworth, where the former intelligence analyst did a 35-year prison sentence, after being translated as secret diplomatic messages about the site WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called a becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering discrimination, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been driven by the quickening analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, the many modalities as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but was openly discussed since her puberty over the identification as a woman was sentenced to 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy-law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one single picture - a basal, black-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platter infant - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012-Project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forenian artifacts like cigarette chaines and chewing gum by extracts the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in jail and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were reported to dissimilar briefs, which were interchangeable with several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Support Images," which would foresee a future in which the president would convert Chelty's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Manning release was asked for seven brutal years in a military attack in Kansas, was a welcome kind of complimentarity.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now in the opening of the exhibition some depth and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweet ways to inflame the rigid divisions that he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that things happen to happen in a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a wall shown on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with her superior signature, including (the "i" in their family name is attached with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written a jack of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 characters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), such as amazingly similar, at least in a biological way, all of us are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take, is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an own space, is a page from the above Comic-Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how they appear with a release shaking in the hand from the disciplinar of the United States like King-Hong Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2206">And even if you neglect anonymity some workers would not waste the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Enrett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has brought people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is on increase in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to provide surveys, specifying groups and demographic hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and FitBit for tracking their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software company analytics tools is used to compete employees.</seg>

<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap-surveys and surveys of particular teams, it offers a heat-card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill up, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, so that you will not be the next Uber, which has been involved in scandals, since then a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of exposure to those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth 2020, according to the SPztechnical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convertible, the company helps to prevent the bad behavior and recognize, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convertible has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convertible company leaves tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth card of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">There is also an anonymous SMS hotline, with the employee can report a bad behavior.</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his employees behaved poorly or behaves unethical, it can be costly consequences by consumer boycott, workers-fluctuations and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been employed Convertible for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Sooner if a clerk wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company convertible up, can have problems, the previously employed by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfluent trainees- quickly identified and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convertible offer your software as a service, and load the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors, which both have supported start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convertible received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitz secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and carried out his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's staff are more expecting their jobs than before.</seg>

<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that's worth it, and that the work that you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, who used both Converting and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve renders when their portfolio companies are well running. companies are going well when employees work and are engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools rely on third parties, commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on staff engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company can not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can cultivate the disappointments and will be incited.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in Business Management company Kotlicas International, who has seen companies who have relied on collecting data too much.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem about Glint is reported, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company will always get new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high sales rates.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he was unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be crazy, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robotics within the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, cemented Professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are funny about it, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpubs have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm to the touch - with aware of human reactions obtained by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs" "" "and choose everything, from the eye-colour of the robot on the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but there is more worrying because many robots have the" "" "personages" "", "that would be a stepper woman to be progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they can be appealing as for example, in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there still the "" "" Frigid Farrah, "which gave the impression of relapsing and" Wild Wendy "" "" with an adventurous "" "" adventurous "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," blackness the website of True Armion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you may like what you like and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixated on conversation or they can" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robotic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the understated female characteristics, the allusions on rape once you go one step on Frigid (is here: disgusting) Farrah, inventing one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website the True Roxxxy synthesized with a Vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"when women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing sophistication in something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR noted its increasing popularity, they still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates from the boundary zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or abusive until they give the free market permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlision that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the women's rights are threatened by women in which the White House has a president to have prawn women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most intimiest aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the muddy body and the spread-out eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they will imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personages" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have mediation or background history, nothing that implies on independence or anything, which could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or in order to express it in the phrase-wise of 2017:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a tampon of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the U.S. electorate, have split their families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest festival in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with horror from Trump's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly attached to our filblisters.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed the power of houmps, families to bring together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this, because my cousin, a centre-directed dechterin who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with republicans in our family, this week has visited me in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls within another context that this will also bring considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was reinforced by Trump, but the horrifying effect of his presidency has the force to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and" "" "normalization" "", "we relate to the grosser way that some day will no longer turn off." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a long-long-term scenario, normalized in the trump of republicans of the right wing, "which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as a byterm of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the Autodach, which looked at 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both occur compared to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If trump goes, the next candidate of republicans must only be mentally, in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousine in the city was, we brought our children to Karussell at Central Park, the largest of the Karusells of the New York Parkour, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if there is no caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the Fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals turn to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many stereotypes of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city shall not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the theme-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40 years to go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before using my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to tip the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerting pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excusable while I was tired of having experienced my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorus was relocated to the hospital by Oscar Pistorius</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorus had the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was transferred to hospital after the treatment of sleigh to his handwrists, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorus was condemned by murder of an appeal for the first totals after a call of prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He was killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by dragging them several times by a door of the toilet cabin inside his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius asserted that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to submit this time to the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say it is too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The EU law enforcement authority said that the Supreme Court of Justice will raise objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius forms danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory bowel motion)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition associated in the US about 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom is causing stomach-warms and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid molyptophan of proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure the detrimental microbes that are hidden in the food, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the equilibrium gets too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result of a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance are conducive immune cell on mice, which bear a particular bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich in tryptophan-rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system is also associated with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study remedies had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but which had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">You suspect that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The disenme of mice have been DNA sequences and it were found six bacterial species, that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them lacked with the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterilous environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they didn't developed this type of immune cells, and they were developed by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria turned out into the immune system, the researchers led by L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquids - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as an idol 3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptopharmation were halved, the number of cells decreased around half.</seg>

<seg id="2849">A union would like to be dedicated to managers of the Biskuit-manufacturer McVitie for the long-term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland said the company had crossed over the future of investments at the Tollo location.</seg>

<seg id="2855">"" "GMB-senior organizer Drew Duffy, said:" "" "the fact that we can win from General-Site manager not clarity about the financial needs and investment plans for the future of Tollo, our members are deeply saddened." ""</seg>

<seg id="2864">The site of La Liga likes to repent your interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not let in its persecution of Neymar after spending an offer of £189 million to trigger his freewheel clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago prior to the world revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has toured the transverse window in the summer because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world chord to break more than double the previous brand, where Paul Szba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced its way to outside, although a source near the Catalans Board stands that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2870">When Manchester City has been interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried, because they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report depleet Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse of abuse of the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the missal scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen will take further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisser, spokesman of the Reformismus "We are church," declared as a bishop of the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their deep regret of their own misconceptions or their then false evaluation of the operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "then criticized that in the reporting of violence at the cathedral spying with" "" "two" "" "double measurement" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, nobody knows that it would have to be "shameful and shameful action" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation," such as the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics committees.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the day-to-day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal" "", "wrote Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one would like to go to the church and this is a found fressen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "furthermore, it pointed out that in their youth" "" "blows a very normal pedagogical means" "", "" "" "to be done with friends, such as I was one, finished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use modern standards for earlier decades as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger was written "My brother of the Pope" (in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him, he values the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 rainbow domites were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s" "" "with high plastering" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, which was held from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it is possible that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims reckoned on the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even reconnect positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of violence of violence, is responsible for the Regensburger Domspatzen" and there is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a too many students stand out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who was detectable by the Ofteren when a dominion has been with no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his Biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you look at the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages, and it is clearly being acquitted from each suspicion of media- or co-failure in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the violence of violence at the presenschule took place outside of its area of efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can pretend to hear about it too late or have taken first hint not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspar's" "" "for the sake of life, was experienced by practically all the respondents - as literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as" "" "warm-hearted" "", "" "" "knowledgeable" "", "as an extremely good-natured teacher who catered the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and chocolates and" "" "always surrounded by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also has led to disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground but also earphones and too cheeky guys withered the hair or ears he has given himself years ago, deeply regrets and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">In his honorary capacity, however, it must be said that such educative methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding techniques?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Naturally, I think everyone of us born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what this is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, are the certainly dredging operations.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you wonder if it was not rather with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed across him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth however is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a great deal was reported on the topic of abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger is also laid down in the final report as any implication or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted itself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a ducking model for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are left out of shame." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus, who would have been a colleague of the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger play a role in regard to abuse waste?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a surveyed student formed it so: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had had (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I consider it... also for really absurd, accepting that expected him..." "" "haunting or more clear or rather open, than in relation to their parents," "" "natsheads," "" "instructors, etc." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to a very clear result:" "" "in advance of affected students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be shared by every fellow citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be discarded to him, not to prevent him or have brought it to ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">That is why there is no reason to relate to his good name with these reluctance, as unfortunately in some cases happened.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violence" "" "to read the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is pushed forward in the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely there is clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report was dealt with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus leader.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible tick-pedagogic, cases where lad of sawling teachers were regulated and maligned and including horrific landers, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom the cathedral-kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the field of the spine for the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the way, like most witnesses emphasise, the subject "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape your escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspar for the spine?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there were already discipline, but just no dizzling violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims expect the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even reconnect positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the proach, have looked left away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts the report could only define two periods, in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was held responsible for the happenings at a school, which he had just not worked and responsible, (as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">George Ratzinger just concealed the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspar's spine, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out that" "" "that in the preschool continues the test sentence practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even before the danger of negative press release he recommended drinkable entry.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This of course was at a time when legal clarity was when testing was also banned in Bavaria or long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">That was difficult to estimate for him, where people may perhaps be exaggerated or dramatic, and where the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can also not say that he had always looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The check of schools in Germany was officially abolished in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to use the current pedagogical standards at the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we have a historian, because of the "pitfalls of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past and present of today's moral measure.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess had already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse that has been abominable at all times and also not for what has been broken in the preschool of adversity and violence at non-school children, which already goes far beyond that time usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all completely awful and I am happy that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so plugs and ear to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a bodily punishment, it has been strictly forbidden, he was strictly kept in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture from his Regensburger time Georg Ratzinger was given in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother" Pope. "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic of testing in the language also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI I., tells of his perspective, because the cathedral-splits played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not believe that he did a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without demanding an associated discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world trants, true cultural harassies of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bondage alone, you do not even make a great singer and face every success, just in what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2987">So what kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and in addition I discovered Georg Ratzinger really quite well and experienced again as wonderful, humorous, magical, deep unbelieving and cordial people, from which one could not imagine that he could also do just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still get in touch with him today, 23 years after his Emprestations, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him up to this day, that he once was strictly with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good, paternal teacher - a very narrow father, certainly, that may be - but still a likeable respect person, to which they still look up and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again, very clearly: all that one casts him are upbringing methods which were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because it is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to do for the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the nasty intent that is behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report which was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the inauguration of the state, a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merit, and without Germany would probably no one know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to make peace in peace.</seg>
