Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this has become clear to the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I always put in drawers and stuck up from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality little . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather rock @-@ nu@@ b . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine . &quot;
most likely , the ac@@ tress spends her time at home , in front of a TV with lo@@ cker@@ em duty and Mexican food , says it in the magazine .
in fact , they bring the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; we do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Lord &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons has to be seen .
the film works with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ s@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remember their holiday , they said in quick Gal@@ lop to the food tr@@ acked .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the riding career ended again already again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all ages - 101 tournament winners - close to horses .
he allowed himself to run with his family via the plant of the AL@@ RV , to a horse , he does not swe@@ eping himself for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports practitioner handed over the husband from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports pyram@@ ide .
on awards , it lacks the sympathetic sports@@ man not .
Bundes@@ vers@@ had@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already tor@@ tured it .
long is the 18th title of the Sports pyram@@ ide .
in Aachen he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social involvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he gave the prize of 25.000 Euro as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ time agreed sports@@ men was taken on Saturday at the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent includes the athle@@ tic Gau@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard G@@ eh@@ mer , the Ru@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ eh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ ball of all Erhard .
many of these sports@@ men have arrived on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part the illustr@@ e Company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the lava price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was at distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ umps economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
un@@ one , however , the two US foreign applicants are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a more basic , rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to stay small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to under@@ estimate the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
himself by contrast it would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump .
he will massi@@ vely fall back regulations and he makes up for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower wheel@@ sets strong - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton then says : the state has certain duties to meet , he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton have almost wor@@ shipped .
democratic App@@ lic@@ in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the national @-@ critical tea @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , we could post @-@ party discussions yet .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and up@@ drive down coal mining in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil production is also supposed to be possible in far @-@ protected areas , the Paris climate change agreement he wants to terminate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton in contrast wants to expand renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both countries do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
the aim is to be paid better then also , is called Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a p@@ itt@@ ance .
they want to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump in this question wants to do is not entirely clear : once he says : the minimum wage must pass , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold on him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least want to demand the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who are alone to flee almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a great kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at a maximum of one year old .
one has laid her small son in her arms .
he gu@@ esses with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother sti@@ ff@@ led to the table @-@ top .
until it notes that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a bearer of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are air @-@ minded .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation available for all@@ ying women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro family and the Munich &apos;s aid aid .
unfortunately , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man at the door .
&quot; it is not excessive to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ per @-@ bearer after Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; many ste@@ al ste@@ al secretly because they do not see a different way out . &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ orary mor@@ den , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon . &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , nar@@ c@@ ise .
here , too many women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inf@@ erior and is mis@@ ab@@ used .
that leads to about 90 percent of women living in the Munich &apos;s north in Munich , appreci@@ ates it .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar to that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
since she is often not kis@@ sed to help , it needs more accommodation just for them , asking for danger .
the seven district governments are responsible for the lodging of refugees in Bavaria .
on the question of whether they wi@@ dens from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so little in lodging of governments not .
in Schw@@ aben , too , women are not housed alone , &quot; said Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press review of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some common shel@@ ters or own homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is calling for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study that was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women can be separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking the privacy or being taken together by men and women , it can - on @-@ going - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the laundry facilities should be separated and easily accessible to women in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women of this reserve sense , it is possible to get the cr@@ ush out of the people who put it to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been around and spoken for us that we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set a second house .
assistance centres : demands for new work amp@@ ires
the assistance of the assistance experts have called to author@@ ise their trade union to approve new labor law in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government was &quot; pers@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems that led to the treaty was refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC governing board has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and demand official negotiations for all of their concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today asked a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a constant programme of escal@@ ating labour fight , which starts early September .
the dispute led to Ass@@ istance in this year to strike the first total waste in the history of N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istance doctor Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana came back after the election to the conclusion of the agreed terms of contract , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place even before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and should be adopted .
following the vote , the Minister of Justice Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be subject to collapse .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external lateral &quot; ?
it was a gesture which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proc@@ laim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin invited his Turkish counter @-@ player in the Con@@ gol@@ stadt Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I cannot deny myself to the inv@@ ade that Ankara is seeking to reconcile this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles seemed slo@@ ped and he barely made heat out , even for his back to the conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdogan should have beha@@ ved so badly as if it had never done anything bad .
for me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin showing radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling , that the President of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in its introduc@@ tions : the shut@@ down of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow was rejected by the reaction of the time .
Putin spoke and accused Ankara , Russia fell into the back .
the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re @-@ establish c@@ ousin is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the nationally controlled media led a fierce , unlimited attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed like the Turks to carry the blame .
in the most serious accus@@ ations were the alleg@@ ations of senior officers that could have benefited from their own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he did not deny this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally this meeting took place only because Putin from President Erdogan he received the ap@@ ology he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
to Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear on hand .
Erdogan is primarily needed by all friends he can get , after he got the last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attack on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number rose by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recorded again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are counting on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week forecast the state television cheaper , fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imported goods are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ j@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West because of its reaction to the tried power of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will come to the continuing Gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to draw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian President in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that he tried after the tried coup to support the elected government bodies .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow is a matter of course , which itself has a deeper fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one of the way it was described by an analy@@ st , portra@@ ying the &quot; Alliance of external side@@ ways . &quot; two countries who viol@@ ate themselves off the West and are being treated poorly .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently faced the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradic@@ tory sides .
it might be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial conversations , both President on the press conference said they had not even stri@@ ped the subject .
the President of Turkey had inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this decision .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found on Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of its potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as the NATO member Turkey ab@@ sten@@ ed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads will at least talk together .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for clients outside Scotland
according to the Board of R@@ BS , the R@@ BS brand has to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand joined the global ambitions of the Bank .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it was almost collap@@ sed and saved for eight years ago .
in this period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they supported the international sport with millions pounds for sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private clients that are becoming more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and collaborators in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be directed at our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand , as well as the brand where our employees are employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS has already declared that it will not continue its six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the ranges of different brands in its sports sponsorship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can lan@@ ci@@ er these marks again , so I think that the time has come .

he continued on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ er , on his local race track with his second profit of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth of Jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat @-@ race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ go@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dre@@ im@@ ali@@ ge winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy that this happened in New@@ market , because I have landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a real Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the itch as he takes the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired twenty @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ sie@@ ger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers .
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , only few in front of him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he would not only have a weekend and great tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already received nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , what is good for a British race but in addition it is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from flying finishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British low@@ r@@ ens for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and won a drug ban .
three years ago he had initially turned into trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to his best .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he will continue to continue with competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ 25 years of age .
Russian Putin ex@@ cre@@ ed Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expec@@ tedly his Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the narro@@ west of confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for the special commission@@ er for environmental and transport facilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged without giving reason &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the &quot; Ivan@@ ov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , Tallinn , he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later worked as Chief Executive and Chief Executive Committee of the Res@@ et personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as head of State , legislative and controls for implementing your instructions .
Putin sent the Russian television broadcast@@ er on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteries .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was long time in one of the narro@@ w@@ ful Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he was in the Soviet service , the K@@ GB .
as a staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the staff went back to his own wish .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
I know that no one at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potentially president , would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - b@@ umped on to great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov than one out of five people he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third presidential coup against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin has become prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son l@@ ent after he proposed producers

ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television studios that produce the series , declare his notice in a common position .
Gib@@ son who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , apologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his la@@ yo@@ ffs .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queens@@ ney Cros@@ sing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four consecutive &quot; covers &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs up to 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons concrete as well as 46 scar@@ ves .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics , Keit@@ h Brown found a visit today and was one of the first to went out of the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ney Cros@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tou@@ chy activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks will take place in Ros@@ y@@ th today in Ros@@ y@@ th . what means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of the tr@@ end@@ setting high and deep underground .
after installing the last road section and its connection with the northern shore deck , we had to closed the existing gap in the north or land side .
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very difficult activity at the same time .
massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 meters long is , approximately 6000 tons weight and at a slope of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
p@@ ale because the toler@@ ances that the team works , is tiny - on every page they bore only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown away from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds that blows the boat apart from their reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and on a boom without life@@ jacket was found .
they all arrived on board the shore Bo@@ ots and were brought back to the life@@ jacket

who builds for cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should in future be much stronger in terms of duty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is lost in nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next R@@ ats@@ session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Group of Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments must be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the affordable apartments can also be in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the city hall is , however , viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how are we going to build with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but can build as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban development programme which will cost millions of costs and has to be financed is intended to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so viol@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants not to be har@@ sh@@ ly for investors .
regardless of whose viol@@ as , viol@@ as , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the apartment market .
the scope of action is implemented , which will provide for additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will be skilled professionals .
yet the program is not entirely obvious : this is about 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built in any case .
but how do you compare the loss of additional about 1300 @-@ priced apartments , which will continue in the coming years ?
it will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020 .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city now .
moreover , it would have to be thought of getting the apartments back in the price links again .
this is possible in the western town .
one fell sw@@ oop to solve the problem .
because in the Western city we are running out for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , the residential construction companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increasing , one gets away from the target of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scr@@ ump@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in only a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens anticipate that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that there cannot be found a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child to play out no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with screens on screens , has been be@@ amed over the last decade of many .
in Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and last on smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I personally refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a draw series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
like many phenomena of popular culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand , sank in early July .
market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that the server over@@ took .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players with their smartphone go outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was younger , then joined the watch@@ man and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in steps , which re@@ jects the average &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an App for Apple Watch , which tr@@ acked 3@@ 5.000 users , shared the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch the game , the number of followed people who ap@@ ing each day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only provides the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to get involved &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to get active from the sofa &apos; and &apos; every day to be active . they came to be do@@ ve ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people make even new friend@@ ships at the hunt .
as always there are murder@@ ous toys , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even when smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and assist many people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ serie
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the floor .
on the entire line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American gymn@@ ast pic@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ election title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world prior to all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medals and &quot; Final Five &quot; teams of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze team to Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ers on the float while the women &apos;s multi @-@ campa@@ igning during the Olympics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American , who wins a multi @-@ struggle title , and in total the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fy their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world championship - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that included a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton said that she is the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was a final test of Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace you after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ class struggle of women at the Olympic Summer 2015 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es collected the first medal at Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the joined @-@ in teams , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi , who served in retirement .
although Bil@@ es insisted , during her long We@@ gs on the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
some of their sedi@@ ments - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass , would be matched to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school escape into the gymn@@ asium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became power .
it has not lost since the summer of 2013 , a multi @-@ struggle competition has been lost , which will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily introduced by two spins , thrust the picture .
bri@@ ga@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holding the world title - lau@@ ded .
she brought again on the hill again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently than they expected their final , - pure form@@ ality - and tears currents on Bil@@ es gle@@ aming red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they described once in their collection book , became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams in which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her stack , she threw the public eye out too , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared doub@@ tful .
what it concerns , so the rapidly expanding t@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the start of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass murder@@ ous accidents in the car accidents
according to the police reporting that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who had been killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass murder@@ ous assault , while they were talking in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ trap , as the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who owned himself owned by the adult victims .
the poli@@ ze@@ is@@ re@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sli@@ pping took the investig@@ ators to become a closer look on whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in the h@@ isp@@ anic inhabit@@ ant within four months in nine attacks and two further viol@@ ates .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month with .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used multiple vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence which they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report over the shooting , which took an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and that it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and insured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ mente from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys , and of course his mother .
but as the least of his age enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know anything .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I won &apos;t .
I don &apos;t make it .
I have not admitted myself .
what is wrong at all -- of course one has left it on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and she has been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund is able to help with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ ling up to its third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycling with support .
he likes to play and sing with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something out . &quot;
&quot; we bring a string to &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign @-@ language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or pulling in pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the lives of with the c@@ ic@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds itself to the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I have been wondering about the forecast for a long time because I don &apos;t expect it to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the gyp@@ sy virus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives occasion to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Governor to call on Friday the emergency . it will be reck@@ oned all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shore and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the national weather service .
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards , with whom official contact with local authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and may be on the way to the affected municipalities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ agli@@ der govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community had requested Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ ring system is used over long parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed us to fall in this area additional 3 to 5 inches in rain .
in the south of Alabama , a fleet was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ lies near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all likely be able to reach record @-@ level after the weekend of record .
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could bor@@ row many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a stro@@ lling @-@ forward run in Ascension is a danger in Ascension , as these streams flow only slowly in Lake Mau@@ re@@ as .
the River PT@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi cap in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue team still sli@@ pped people from the floo@@ ding water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and its boots found themselves among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water is at Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , very strong by night .
he said that he would have warned him another step of step , who had been living in the vicinity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flo@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Han@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabilities and he is the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ th@@ eline had saved all three in a great military truck and brought them to the next fire@@ watch in Glo@@ ster where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities should take account of ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been greatly en@@ acted by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street records the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and graduated in five schools .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary EM@@ L reported that a passenger in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 predicted houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now both in@@ und@@ ated .
the ruler of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed by the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergen@@ cies were established to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be back into their homes again , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were closed due to the flood @-@ water and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants of the passenger who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar case .
in Mississippi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys continued that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements a handful of houses have been reported on Thursday as over@@ flooded , but on Friday I have not been reported .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; sli@@ pped of balls , &quot; survi@@ ves sli@@ pping in Philadelphia
the police share with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy shot in Philadelphia , this week has already shot the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grandparents gave that brown lap@@ ses several she@@ dding , including in the Lev@@ in , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital in consciousness .
&quot; he has been through a lot , his small body was sh@@ ac@@ red by bul@@ let , &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ts to the station .
I cannot simply believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo up multiple operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter , that it is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported on the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police find themselves whether one of the most injured men of the perpetrators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several guns .
pat@@ ron@@ age sle@@ eves for storm @-@ pipes , which were rep@@ uted to different storm rep@@ el , over@@ se@@ wn the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a struggle for a permanent struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , they found sle@@ eves .
thus , it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said Police @-@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , police in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and cars met in the area .
there was no celebration at any time and the police are checking out reports according to reports .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ad on the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
they are reco@@ vering over and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie need
that is what I present to me under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic office and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been in case of every summer olymp@@ ic program and the U.S. has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ men , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin @-@ color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ dine is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , rounds , makes every pride .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was among the female tur@@ ner@@ ed an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics and hon@@ ed America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ed g@@ ym@@ atic routines .
on Thursday Simone was praised the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won in an individual multi @-@ struggle event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so the classes throughout the country do not look out .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to manage it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ers in the crew . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer .
but the reality looks so that gymn@@ asts is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts will be primarily combined in private gymn@@ asium , which will be maintained for training , furnis@@ hing , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is for families a te@@ ens and long term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , instructor of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the tower .
we need to get inspired the con@@ gregations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , making an affordable and easy access to gym .
I was founded my Turn@@ around 20 years ago .
in my events we have offered free and affordable matches in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ ers who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sports .
drying develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the spirit .
this combination offers long @-@ term benefits for health as well as school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this crew , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; gives you so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance experts want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistant who voted in a vote did not reject him .
in July , Hun@@ t plans revealed the contract to establish the contract and said that N@@ HS was ordered in a &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay in the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance should receive a new contract , the changes to night and weekend work , in order to improve the care of such movements .
D.@@ Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ ters for Ass@@ istenz@@ mates said the last night in a communication with : &quot; ass@@ istants have serious concerns , in particular that it is sanc@@ ti@@ fy the current occupancy crisis and it is administered to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks , which remain still , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A for resolving disputes by discussions gave rise to the government on the sake of reluc@@ tance and sometimes on ear @-@ raising silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the happened of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made the last month ago that his door would always stand open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise awareness and address the worries of the assistance centres . &quot;
should he not do this , they have made it clear to the assistance centres that they are ready to carry out further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates since nur@@ ses and medical practitioners were included to meet doctors at the expe@@ dient chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better version of Europe for the 5@@ 4.000 ass@@ istants to be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance to end a strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour fight measures reach nothing of the only little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months we have discussed the con@@ fu@@ elling of assistance and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries in respect of concerns with regard to tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were returning from a vocational training , training holidays and gender @-@ specific gender pay in medicine , how seriously it is the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug to lower the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the setting @-@ using drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , whereby the risk of a stroke is reduced or another heart attack .
the regulatory authorities N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended for a maximum of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended for a maximum of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries , the ins@@ criptions are formed .
if the Bel@@ ag breaks , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots , that c@@ eps the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack , will subject to a higher risk to another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca , and under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que is reduced , reduces this risk by making the formation of cl@@ ots more likely .
the implementation design of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health @-@ assisted Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively helps in reducing further heart attack and stroke cases with people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from them .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - in particular the risk of blood - is restricted to a period of up to three years . suspension design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ an lets b@@ lossom in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ist has led to that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities will know@@ ingly be ignored like a crus@@ hing government report today .
the former cabinet member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles re@@ inde@@ pen the police , electoral monitoring and Town H@@ alls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ ers and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , who now is a face @-@ corrupt , said that intimi@@ dation by voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set out waste hing@@ es outside of electoral cabin to protect the intimi@@ dating voters .
he recommends that voters should take a hint of themselves to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er must name his name and address .
the report proposes not to limit the finger to a person when she agrees to give her election , to prevent that someone chooses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to have more access to municipal agencies and decisions made by non @-@ official com@@ partments or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election fraud , but is also intended to protect the municipal government in front of the broad@@ ening inter@@ rup@@ tions and financial culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Leg@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a special Elec@@ tions decided that the am@@ ti@@ zing mayor of Lut@@ ein was to be relie@@ ved in cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ple@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ gregation and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ophobia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses a person from others .
Sir Eric said it would be evidence of fraud across the country .
he vo@@ iced in particular to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election - where older members of the Muslim community would have taken pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the pipes of out to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof has been appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to elect according to the will of the elder , particularly communities with Pakist@@ ani or ban@@ an background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions should have ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correctly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition of editing political activists and op@@ tionally to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , is also calling for tougher registration reviews , in order to avoid that the electoral directory is used for immigration and social welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters in front of the election according to your identification document .
do not remove even ink on the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent someone chooses twice .
systematic audi@@ ts about the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are in@@ eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic mail election .
ban that political activists complete complete envelope and envel@@ opes of stamp @-@ elections .
the police give authority to put away barriers to campaign stations .
a legislative change that made an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Represent@@ atives in 1983 ) .
photography er@@ bot in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in constitu@@ encies ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure the employees are able to assert that voters go alone into the electoral cabin .
Sir Eric goes on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amazing &apos; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets did not show any accus@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice gave Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a l@@ it@@ ry of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been found guilty on a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Control &quot; check@@ ers &quot; of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court martial in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of parliaments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the worrying and co@@ vert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ singer and other famous semi @-@ sport athletes in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are available this week on the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of the edge and band , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ president of the Du@@ chy of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to give gold batt@@ ling athlete with his own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not , if one must believe the social media believe .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that flow on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympics , which have more than just a certain similarity with wood @-@ famous de@@ ities .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in she@@ ars Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
besides K@@ ates double @-@ tail on the bike track , many people on the Internet were pointed out , like a certain arch@@ ery of the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in she@@ ar@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he appeared to the wolf of Wall Street Star or secretly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave to that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see a big similarity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; told Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a goo@@ se@@ looking guy , so I guess the probably as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the sincere similarity between British Prime Minister Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes is said to be a double @-@ gi@@ ver for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ onian .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user thinks that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who shows similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ ond hair like the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ch@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans was att@@ ested , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual shape and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the similarities .
theory into the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their cont@@ entment that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. football @-@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular comparisons described Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone turned off when he can put his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald who has been brought to the comment@@ ator on the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the conclusion , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , when many were reported to him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ ti@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
a different Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ comp@@ ress the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ d@@ led .
short time later Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been aired about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a unfortunate formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC applied at the end of more than 90 times in the people who have been responding to the artwork on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colony Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also apologi@@ zed quickly and gave a communication out .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them .
last night we exc@@ used quickly at our spectators on the broadcast and our followers in social media yesterday .
to clarify one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of swimming in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were inadequate and a unhappy formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald apologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that she was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ olog@@ ise for the comment that I have made after the wom@@ an@@ te@@ ah@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I took care of the performance of the s@@ add@@ in and not related to it as a person . &quot;
evi@@ dently no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark indign@@ ant about women who under@@ wear in the middle of business under@@ wear
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see where a woman drew her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try out sub @-@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she pat@@ ter@@ ned how she saw it , moved them out and put it back into the shelf .
you scroll down and tried four pairs of sub @-@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman was h@@ itting the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had conquered the under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she returned and left the shop without having to buy something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right in the middle of the shop , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the base , moved their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tasted them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each star@@ ing when she moved back the under@@ pants , which obviously did not please her , as she put it into the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other sub@@ tro@@ users , before she finally decided that her nothing was hang@@ ed up and went out again .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants they had to watch . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and which were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got involved , the employees have tried to pull the clothes from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman she had and went out again and were not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone , consciously . &quot;
all products in question have been sold out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed rob@@ bers on distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn on the sp@@ it for your predat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach yourself from behind , then you should turn out to be a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move from the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him then with his knees in the gro@@ in , and turn it while the att@@ acker is squee@@ zed in front of pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the running into the face and move back@@ wards as they set the weapon to him .
in att@@ ackers , that approach the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the stream , grab the gun and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
shift at the same time the weight to the gun and strike the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before they move back@@ wards and set the gun towards it .
sounds difficult ?
check out the video to see exactly how it goes to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ bery it is most sur@@ est to pass your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the narro@@ west of Europe
a British trav@@ eller will undergo his immune system and spice x a serious test - by putting some of the narro@@ w@@ est and ec@@ lec@@ tic spots of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k she@@ wed his course to a Euro shooter , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dish@@ wah@@ er and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
in front of the desc@@ ended of each object he used a lumin@@ ous to show up and show us what it will be settled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was caught under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought , the dish@@ wash@@ basin of a mig@@ r@@ attle lets , which was used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals concerning the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria , as well as his own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind , which he ch@@ ased , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been well known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ roads to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing man@@ oeu@@ vre of res@@ tro@@ oms , the task set its immune system definitely below a sample
in the film , he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what affects my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial @-@ line showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .

Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have called in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I am not going to lick here because it is ec@@ static here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company stat@@ s Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us which contains both dairy and vitamin C and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ os senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that &apos;s intrigu@@ ing to look at and at the same time the benefits of probi@@ otics .
we introduced crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming by that ended up that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in the gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary , we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian when he would have tasted some of the things I have reli@@ ant on , such as the ek@@ y Russian res@@ tro@@ om shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to install them and others with which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents rep@@ lied military @-@ bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of the stomach and the gut , and 58 percent said that they might at least use products which include l@@ actic acid @-@ bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left its social house after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 , because it wre@@ ak their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ lik@@ cock were cast after a long list of griev@@ ances from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
once they were removed from their estate they found sho@@ cking employees of the housing of the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls reported gaz@@ ed holes , wood di@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was cut to the walls .
the family were killed and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be viewed as such a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also known .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and said the police that the terror that had joined the family , tram@@ pling with bas@@ kets , intimi@@ dated by residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug abuse and floods .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old garbage was found
there were ri@@ pped in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past that were ri@@ mp@@ ed wooden ri@@ mp@@ s .
neighbours said they saw them in the street and regularly had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing @-@ o@@ gi@@ fted them and their partners this week viol@@ ently from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to move freely .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They asked for no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we have the police here are incredible .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there , because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house that the police was called regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the community , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys are thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that there is the r@@ enter , any responsibility for their behavior and that of her family , since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step of taking Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
it was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and its actions for their neighbors had to be taken aw@@ ful .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the Assembly , who were courageous to us and have provided us with the information provided .
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and that the message is convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck told that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , inserted in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground
workers of the house@@ administration will now have to cre@@ el the garbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 the police led a raid in the house and found via 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ ri@@ dden and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was given a penalty after it being found guilty of the own@@ ing a drug of class B in trade @-@ sight .
she asser@@ ted that money was saved for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 with a car accident .
having been without Ob@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many carp@@ enters of the house were heavy with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will use tenants which do not stick to the house@@ order
Angela C@@ row told by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is a clear warning to the other tenants which do not stick to the house order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they may be able to act without self @-@ reliance as well as those who were har@@ med by such behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal put at panic after a ti@@ eff@@ ci@@ ve military jet
sun lovers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal found the shock of their life
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of air forces laid an incredible storm @-@ flight
the air@@ strikes proved that it was on a training tour , but pers@@ isted that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment , in the lack of tourists start panic into panic after a ti@@ ered jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft almost in close proximity to the sun shut@@ ters on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers rose when they were understand@@ ably an@@ gled to make worry about the noise of the der@@ v@@ entri@@ c works , without seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who took videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was one moment when it looked like it would overthrow . &quot;
Nun@@ o arrogan@@ tly added : &quot; I was especially surfing and it felt like going down the plane to me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of darkness and flew extremely deep .
the Portuguese air@@ stre@@ ak powers today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and thereby had to fly as deep that this was the only way to realize it .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet was driven somewhat deeper than usual due to poor conditions of view , but pers@@ isted the air forces that security was at no time endangered at any time .
area fires have destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese forti@@ ori , where also four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - strong fog and fire @-@ smoke - as deep as his view was limited .
the aircraft was on a training flight , in which the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with concerns against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step of the first introduction of the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans are competing for the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the post@@ lu@@ de increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ ex has to sacrifice in the correlation with the sub @-@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe League Champion under others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , which unter@@ takes the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
furthermore , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre @-@ Andre Shepherd is missing .
the German lap@@ ses in the training a band@@ aged in the knee , with what the first question in Bar@@ ca is at least clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen we@@ t@@ len@@ ders in Barcelona have been at number one for two years now .
Coach Luis En@@ rique renoun@@ ced a clear decision so far and sent Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen in the majority of the remaining applicants .
before the first mandatory play of the new game time , there is doubt about the fitness of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at the age of 3 : 2 in the pro@@ long@@ stop against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. are not really convincing .
Seville in turn gives the 2 : 3 defeat for pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and strives to di@@ gest the second triumph in the &apos; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &apos; .
Barcelona has finally won eleven successes at the record high@@ ers in this competition .
Ma Long in a very own league for ping p@@ ong tables
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Tis@@ th@@ ong Olympic stadium .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ way finale to his Land@@ mark and &quot; title defen@@ ders &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5 : 4 ) .
that won the World Ran@@ kings @-@ First the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title among each other .
so that was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese title would catch the single title of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the top of the podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the record alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they had no codes at themselves .
they had withdrawn on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their defen@@ ders in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until now I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; had said Z@@ hang .
after the game @-@ posed gold and silver medals with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
after that , he set the pace at the record , leaving Z@@ hang only as a total of 13 points .
through the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected match .
however , nevertheless there were sufficiently breathtaking ag@@ ility to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the Bronze Class against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the White @-@ rus had itself in his quarter @-@ final against the German duo Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , and was then in medical treatment , had to settle for &quot; ultimately &quot; with lead .
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have become similarly high table @-@ based Olympic @-@ Vi@@ k .
Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Viol@@ ent Problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative state states to hold their majority .
the presidential election Council Donald Tr@@ ump gave the weaknesses of his campaign in favour of the current Republi@@ can plateau in Utah .
a rare moment , in which usually co@@ cky and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire says something like concerns expressed , such as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 rivals within the own republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ik@@ alen , who asked for support in key federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame for false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took back his famous media folders .
republi@@ can high @-@ pl@@ ums
Utah is a safe bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , according to Tr@@ ump and his conc@@ ub@@ ines of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , likewise .
other institutes also look in the front , but not by far the distance , which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
this also applies to Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview by CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question of how he would be able to stop the march Clin@@ ics again : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
and if lag@@ ging behind , this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not end for him at the end of the reasons for political correctness , be that in order , Tr@@ ump said .
then return to a very good way of life .
according to press report , the party &apos;s report should have threatened to strike funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present better re@@ frac@@ tion@@ able values .
instead of it , the candidates of re@@ public@@ ans would change even stronger among the arms .
Olympia : pi@@ ke fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission in the event .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics are threatened with the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud test of a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach back home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with promptly a discipl@@ in@@ ist commission to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ist function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I .
this was reported by the teamwork of Kenya by the dop@@ ing control .
the World association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to impose its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions in the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a rating &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has been part of the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the test and signed , &quot; declared Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was in the custody of the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for training checks of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan paraly@@ sis Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio @-@ Games .
he is supposed to be informed about money payments of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports he should be arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya is at IO@@ C after a number of dop@@ ing action already since long time under special observation .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio @-@ Games was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into sight .
the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had much pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight was compliant with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , the ARD were repeatedly imposed that in Kenya D@@ oping means , there are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of the sporting activity .
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und recently challenged a similar study in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian athle@@ tics unit .
thereby , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ wide and systematic assignment .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were subsequently excluded from the summer &apos;s games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ Year present the Salzburg Festival explores the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a Musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Orch@@ ester@@ dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we actually have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Lady .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y in her dar@@ mer@@ ry with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it resembles me much , my Italian character that I have known as the Romans , laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honor to work with her .
it is an extremely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting a rigi@@ dity is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his gl@@ ances , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity this musical experience to share with him .
we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we did the refugees , at that time the pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want to .
these are the same themes and they are just as meaningful today as they were at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

in February 2015 SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school girls from the east of London rose in a plane direction Turkey and then moved to a bus to the Syrian border .

Turkey : Kurdish community counting on mass evasion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on a packed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the tru@@ sting of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects to flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice with ten thousand people who escaped from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term it could even be &quot; some hundreds &quot; thousand , &quot; the association @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the harsh approach of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan on the coup attempt in Germany , the Kurdish community expects a mass evasion by Germany .
&quot; in short , I reck@@ on with ten thousand , medium @-@ term persons from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; said the commander @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already passed over a long strongh@@ olds ago with prisons , about 500,000 Kurds appear in Turkey on the run .
after the failed put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to start out in Europe if they are further sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the Association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
by this Erdogan wants to increase the pressure @-@ pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wiped out or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , which is also CD@@ U member .
the president demanded that the federal government was &quot; sharp &quot; as Österreich against Erdogan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan &apos;s critics .
in recent months I have no longer feel safe in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the flight of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition parties .
the Brand@@ mark@@ ers as man@@ tle @-@ supporters destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on a pack@@ er , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper reported under appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of Labour , the Turks was already afraid of the coup as the largest group of political persecution recognised asylum seekers in Germany .
as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people were entitled to 11.@@ 386 people and therefore barely 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey it is not a matter of war , poverty , or fu@@ tility .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , therefore by state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where to go , where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
universal Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia are not allowed to choose land .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the federal election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has decided already at the beginning of the year .
because so far it is not about : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ speaking battle - this is concerned .
the locals who are to be convinced of the fighters are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so are not allowed to vote the country day .
to do this , practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , air balloon , fl@@ yers and end voices count , only exhausted .
by the 4th of September 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go over yet even an election campaign , close to the people .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be about his job .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clear in surveys behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how much new@@ bie ap@@ ing cuts and what remains at the end of a replacement .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 ruling chief , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its large fac@@ ades .
he travels through the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as it did already his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ger &apos;s predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , he got sea @-@ fir@@ ering feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the guilt of the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rise of right popul@@ ists , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which will probably cost him the beautiful office now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place electoral campaign .
she was invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major r@@ allies ; Merkel Bundest@@ ur@@ ised district is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not work , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; compl@@ aining Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also no shame to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U renoun@@ ced the usual constitu@@ encies of the market and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
in such a way , co @-@ co@@ operates , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordinate role &quot; .
also , the union has noticed that , on the land , it s@@ wind@@ ed the basis that it needs to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again .
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ ses of the country barely available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U vote against his collaborators , however , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be exploited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called up for an especially dedicated election campaign .
in surveys , the S &amp; D Group stood at least 22 percent per partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under before the Af@@ g ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD still had a clear number of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should create the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need a modern virtue and reloc@@ ate their constitu@@ ency in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the President of the President Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green franchise has started looking for native speakers to native speakers to the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading edge @-@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ ga lakes and finds it even nice .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ restau@@ ration : Gast@@ ro@@ wers are suffering from blocking
at the speed , with which the B is re@@ arranged , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible of construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and end until at 8 pm , there is always praise .
&quot; they have done everything quite a cris@@ y , &quot; told El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no amplifier .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south half @-@ time scheduled to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the object is also rede@@ emed for the construction work , for example , when it comes to setting up persever@@ ance trips .
since the construction site on Monday to the south and also the block of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was repe@@ aled and therewith the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now be guarded by O@@ f@@ ter@@ m@@ ingen from the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; he responsible for the transport @-@ technical management of the refurb@@ ishment leader Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sc@@ amm@@ ers searched and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ posting .
what led to some truck in dwell@@ ings .
since also the speed b@@ umps are not observed , the community also sought out the Mess@@ aging vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself about the situation for himself .
there are two to three per minute lit@@ red .
the quick@@ est was with 77 hour kilometres in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to turnover in turnover , lets each one ask , look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , for other companies , for whom there are hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no slight fall , &quot; but also that of course &quot; the balance of course is lacking . &quot;
the strongest cl@@ ed are the shops along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the gast@@ ro@@ ses have made it very hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every Euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added the sales revenue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road@@ blocks have thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to release him .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt called on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference , the guest @-@ site benefited otherwise from the advantages of location on the B . now , they must also bear the disadvantages , which result in restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something had been acquired with funding .
in all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family run has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now less often subject to complicated traffic @-@ management , he can understand .
if you can not go down , it is also somewhere else .
that its tribal cli@@ ent@@ el after the end of the restoration work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 @-@ construction on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its Gast@@ stätte in its long history .
six months of construction , this is already brutal .
constantly in the name of the terrorist attack on laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now publishes a big security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ing status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ er say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the launch of his new security code . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you over@@ demand anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also to participate with participation as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Interior Minister , it was well located to him and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retreat consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced , en@@ ins@@ ed , that a new security authority for the sc@@ rap of de@@ coded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives on air @-@ light and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
part starts de Mai@@ zi@@ ère a second attempt for suggestions that have not yet to be held with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and turn the jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adm@@ its the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of that , he does not consider it reasonable , and does not demand anything that in case of a co@@ ali@@ er partner is there any chances .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
these are partly in itself : he plans fast procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ tained by people before deportation .
refugees who are de@@ ported to the country must check @-@ in their smartphones and disclose social media account for a safety check .
at D@@ ul@@ ing for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - for example - such a crime to commit or reject their papers in order to conce@@ al their identity .
some of them is political and legal sensitive .
it also has un@@ folded and leaves questions frank@@ ly .
and in some points - with the unequal treatment of patient - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to pronoun@@ ce that the attacks were killed by Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg &apos;s refugees .
there were also many people concerned about high refugee numbers around safety .
and things that deeply occupied people settled in election times even in election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the re@@ assurance is great .
and yes , there are voting rights .
the Union and the SPD is therefore increasingly taking place on the issue of inner safety .
in the past few days it went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ dener dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons , where the intelligent@@ sia is also calling for a bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also desc@@ ends here to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes .
he consider nothing of a return from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you are new to un@@ subscribe , be not reasonable .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for the co@@ ali@@ an area , you have to show itself only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could ensure a dispute .
but also the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filed with the subject of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party Manager Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first of careful conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still comes Volkswagen glimp@@ sed through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures increase worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs smoothly .
in the recall campaign , there is a notion .
Volkswagen starts to run the ship@@ pers in the second half @-@ year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car@@ makers can continue to show up a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and weigh@@ ed for the overall sale of how that recorded in the D@@ ax company .
sold around the world , the VW Brand in July , with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the same year of the previous year .
alone in Western Europe , after China is the second most important market , the sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the home market Germany s@@ spoiled the shipment to almost one @-@ sixth .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it was given a department store in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also bur@@ dened for ex@@ iting from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the gas @-@ aff@@ aires escal@@ ated first , there is also farther a minus to Bu@@ che .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly concerned house of the Nieder@@ sachsen is still further swe@@ aty by the diesel @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to Bu@@ che .
group e@@ pl@@ eb@@ led Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales split from January to July .
1,3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , around 5,@@ 9@@ 54 million .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software and hospitable .
alone in Germany , VW is calling around 2.5 million truck for conversion into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects .
after the improvement of the vehicles there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer after the re@@ armament is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cause of the legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had announced that Volkswagen grant its German customers a guarantee of continuous diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday of VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
out of the Verkehrs@@ Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the conditions of my investigation commission and the KBA &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power , after the re@@ armament did not occur , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by expanding the term &quot; warranty , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come for example a half year after the conversion , for example , with a motor damage to a workshop - and that might lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid having any other damage that does not have anything to do with the bug@@ ging sc@@ andal which comes into uncertainty with regard to possible guarantees , as it was named .
because of this , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee &quot; .
Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see demands from rich spar@@ rows in future prisons - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , which park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or c@@ ash@@ boards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German association German banks refers to an individual case and does not see a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not have to fear for its savings of austerity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent criminal .
this fee calls for the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ out from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or bank accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul .
for a while he has been 40 million Euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not reproduce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for any million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost does now continue after the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
the cash just lying in the saf@@ es of the ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank .
most of the clients have had an understanding and are rarely seen in other spheres of investment .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gene @-@ ence of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the far @-@ monetary policy course of the ECB is causing substantial costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to carry it alone if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business @-@ economic is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger operates made headlines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking Association , said : &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide records for deposits , so the competition in Germany is far too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chin @-@ up , which is equipped with a little lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if they have free money hat@@ s .
the Gen@@ o@@ cop@@ ic bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see .
in the region you live well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gene @-@ cooperative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comp@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ person seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Federal Association of German folk banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had said at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to neg@@ atives neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is tough , and it threaten the migration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please this in width .
destination plates : who actually purchases sound plates ?
lonely men love middle @-@ age love plates .
before you go to the Com@@ mentary Com@@ mentary to the commentary in order to over@@ saw him under the alias of non @-@ old men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v the complex re@@ development of vin@@ yl was not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to greet the news of physical objects , but to the Mid@@ life No@@ stal@@ gie .
those who have recently purchased a record are of all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older records retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho , a modest pit , before I stay ste@@ amed , my hands hold and something determin@@ ant as : &quot; so , let &apos;s have a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is slow due to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where the independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman the camera to turn off the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle aged men , a woman , presumably the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and going through the stores to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , question I ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets .
these gram@@ ophone , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I am not responded to him at home ) dress up the walls of his apartment .
the reason why he has such a si@@ zable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and buy items that he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , who was released when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and liked to spend their own time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my case .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , thinks that many customers meet , which he meets at the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe people who heard about the com@@ eback , and will be able to see their old records again .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been dra@@ ined in this way around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who were once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of followers of the records of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers attended the contact with the non @-@ cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some turn@@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound@@ ing envel@@ opes , of objects , the lucky Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it may be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s so good with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally engaging .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ us@@ hes an employee of a label .
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record last month , they have not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % own a turn@@ table they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I blows at the stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio head sil@@ plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more production , less music cl@@ as@@ ant .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who are only slowly puri@@ fied .
stop that has dedicated the noise almost a whole floor has a b@@ lower audience , as I go clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle aged .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester Synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ packers Pop instead of experimental jazz - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but some mental trau@@ mas are hard to be as@@ certain@@ ed if one stands beside someone in 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for several minutes and considers the vari@@ et@@ own of the drives .
it is more of a man@@ nequ@@ in than a large one .
it does not deserve much , therefore , collecting plates is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... it is driven with a man @-@ loved sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of records .
while I seem to mut@@ ing the je@@ ans &apos;s hot@@ spots , I watch a group of young teen@@ ager , who group for a moment on the pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter think , to buy a cros@@ ley plate .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put it on .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items can mean more money for the industry and give some customers in the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one who gives the most for luxury items such as plates .
even if my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are at least in record business in Soho , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , records and in online stores exist .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through plates , while they ste@@ er the rigi@@ ble view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator that prot@@ ru@@ des over the shoulders of nothing of middle aged men .

during a trial of trial this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional business in which people within the camp goods , sell cigarettes until En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture , argued that these places would be s@@ lic@@ ed down , because they would pose a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and san@@ ity risk val@@ bard .
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that were offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ mon@@ or@@ ical business , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café of the camp which is shared with charity and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &quot; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those children of a catastrophe would be the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxili@@ aries help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated on Friday that the number of living conditions has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep asc@@ ending of new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer .
despite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his dis@@ closing show in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ pro Tony Martin does not want to get his chance to get started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep the World Cup wide , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have a statement for his mis@@ used twel@@ f@@ th place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it was honestly difficult to comment the time passing from yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must be able to analyze in peace what reasons for the deb@@ acle would have led .
Martin actually wanted to fight the title at the time of the Time Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Group rises with start @-@ up for live video exc@@ uses
watch other folks while playing video games , is a Ries@@ ling - of which I will also benefit from Microsoft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology group buys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money flows for the acquisition , Microsoft does not share on Thursday .
Be@@ am went on with his offer first in January and has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but even intervene .
for example , they can abandon players missions and provide enemies as well as deplo@@ ying equipment .
the Spiel@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook should help .
the advertising industries are already listening .
the staff of the start @-@ ups based on its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft headquarters in California Red@@ mond , like Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
this means that the customer should not change any way through the assumption .
Be@@ am is built according to Microsoft in the video section around the Xbox console .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany R@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed test : in different federal states , inter alia in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on in@@ toler@@ able points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or block bridges with temporary red , there is often no necessary infrastructures in order to ensure that a stationary gl@@ itter is to ensure the speed limit .
but a continuous mobile design can be too dangerous or complicated .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its cordless holds five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
by laser technology , all vehicles can also be captured over multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed b@@ umps and access @-@ bot@@ tom@@ less after time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ driven state you can move the pend@@ ant according to the manufacturer with each car using a trailer cl@@ utch .
to that it is not simply che@@ wed , it is lowered in the instrument @-@ run , so that the wheels in the le@@ ased and by the way also van@@ ish also shr@@ ink@@ le out@@ wear .
moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to the information provided by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hes lightning with the new technique : recently France has res@@ ett@@ led 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening for a ru@@ th@@ ed stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ gree stage in Rio .
Fiji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , p@@ aves , line @-@ run and ro@@ her power to win Gold - her first Olympics of any color .
defeat was won by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ cs , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day might fall to them in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fiji on this form could have been a 15 @-@ man team in form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ coach Ben Ryan , the former Chief of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago , they lost every game of the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this work@@ book will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks G@@ b@@ S have fun of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au going over in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wai has yet another attack on the right @-@ hand corner that he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly announced the ball .
a he@@ vor@@ ing T@@ ackle von Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped .
in the seventh minute le@@ te J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner is a touch@@ down , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning since the in@@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kled of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s so , as if Fiji was born about it to play the 7 while UK is still un@@ see@@ ded .
this is the way it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ese gap ... for quite four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua ran Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for a long time in favor of South Os@@ se@@ ar@@ aner , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame sat the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the wh@@ istle , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB k@@ ic@@ ts crus@@ hing out in the law@@ ns .
earlier in the day , Fiji Japan had conquered Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pressed South Africa in a half @-@ final match from the race - British conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton passed the line with an impressive kick @-@ work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ minute team , captured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for a stroke of rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ ts gold than in these games and that wants what is hot .
from the first stroke until the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve that go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even if it were only the confes@@ sions that were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Ech@@ o of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as she was at the second Olympics in two without the tax lady , the first women in the history of British sport which laid upon such a scale .
their dominance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ loaded use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which is not the kind of the Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he says to ge@@ ze .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to wil@@ der hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach who was not aware of about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed at all cancer than was diagnosed with him .
as he said he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and this they did .
if you do not , it spreads throughout .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment early 2014 , out of season , could begin to keep the break down a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran out around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the in@@ ability of victory , their first thought of Williams , who had a nerve @-@ taking morning to talk a little more than otherwise , tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was considered captain in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that might be something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it &apos;s just repeated , how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also the Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive Thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to carry or wish a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even at the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark reached , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called for the &quot; stay in the process , &quot; stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t look out to make a difference .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ adventur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now they just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this feels so much better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 years of experience for clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , goes to retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose as a model for big water producers .
this meant that it was some time ago in the original about Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
only a little later the water@@ forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken put up the two @-@ hand association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ a group was exemplary as exemplary . &quot;
behind all that is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , the 31 year in the two @-@ hand staff , 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ stein @-@ group with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of lati@@ tude , has around 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 locations and past@@ ors with approximately 5@@ 500 residents .
member municipalities are the communities of Kirch@@ berg , wides@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for more towns and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
the current chairman , the Breit@@ brun@@ d Citi@@ zen of Ger@@ tru@@ d Dance ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was set up as water atten@@ dant and was appointed as director of the second @-@ hand association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and extended from water construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , bud@@ get@@ ery creation , calcul@@ ating fees and contributions to emergency periods at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the bat@@ ches of water lines .
there have been no interruption and I have always recorded innovations because water is inf@@ ant and drinking water the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised Go@@ als for tru@@ sty , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has beha@@ ved himself with a lot of heart for his water@@ purpose and he was able to establish the water @-@ purpose appropriately , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ stein @-@ group to the nit@@ rite level in front of the water@@ forum of the Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ well praised Wasser@@ wart As@@ f@@ ons Greek , who worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper , and he was a tru@@ thful kno@@ b .
together , we were an unbeatable team .
as highlights from his point of view he noted the fountain and the restructuring of the two @-@ system association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tube @-@ breaking at the high container at the lou@@ der lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages were supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at the same time have only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with bottles .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was passed to Daniel Stür@@ mer from lou@@ der that enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly goes to the au@@ ti@@ stic of her son Ti@@ ago - and addresses other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;

when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now gets private in New York , where it will give the best therapists .
&quot; in order to give an example : if I ask him something about what two years ago , when I sang at the mailbox , he re@@ members himself nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cr@@ acks and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ metre @-@ height .
financial stresses that are threatened by the industry from the fossil @-@ bro@@ mine funding are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there remain in the liberation from the Renewable Energy Program in the components of Germany in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fre@@ eg@@ ram ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years we were able to finally reach the tough negotiation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers , the gases from the Ho@@ cho@@ king to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , to checkout .
the steel industry achieved an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year , according to the German industry association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there are now a basic cleaning with the European Commission following talks with competitive Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on ap@@ ti@@ y production .
this will largely be attributed to the status quo of the previous regulation .
special significance have the successful effort from Gabriel for the Steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is the future &quot; that is a first step . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment goals , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has since the 2008 financial crisis has been under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation has exac@@ erb@@ ated considerably more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast steel in the face of the weaker domestic demand for steel on the world market .
European manufacturers are throwing Chinese steel counter @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand the import of import duties on import @-@ steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China enligh@@ tens up .
unclear is how sustainable the price re@@ conditioning is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p was careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ant again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted not to exclude lock@@ ings of individual works .
in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were employed .
in July , the German steel manufacturers are careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tonnes to a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the economic association of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the set left behind the second month was left behind .
since the beginning of the year , production lies around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates an increase of order for the coming months , thanks to an improved increase .
community , spirit , health : singing is the sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for their entire life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the mag@@ ister@@ ium , she defeated the f@@ ach music , and today sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir choir .
&quot; singing makes me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
she is doing something good to do with her health and mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ ter from the German old senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most Sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , the sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because they often solve social and family structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , exercising a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as the doll as well in everyday life .
even if it is about obtaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the German labour community of sen@@ iors organizations .
in older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing aids in older people stir@@ s many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth .
by lyrics and especially tunes , it den@@ ses itself against ill people in a long way .
when singing , the head is also required to perform a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
simultaneously focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are not only able to focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : when I go for something for a long time , I will better and grow beyond me - this experience will strengthen .
good reasons to start with singing , there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t get it alone - with 50 sin@@ king people who he@@ ars a tone next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer you have sen@@ iors several ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors , one can simply join .
many cities also offer insights about the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders .
many senior citizens can also be found via the internet .
anyone who has no access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours around help with the internet .
those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul is doing good and has something fre@@ eing - that is true for every age .
cats react sensitive as a han@@ go@@ ver on cri@@ es of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover which effect the cri@@ b of cat @-@ baby on adult animals .
to their surprise the boys also left the males not cold - but they remained in contrast to the females always alike .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ aining of cat &apos;s kittens at the beginning of the children .
they respond to ten percent more quickly to lu@@ te of kittens who find themselves in great need to find out how scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ rage of less and strongly aroused juven@@ iles for the males either not percep@@ tible or not important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens is distinguished with the urgency of their aid .
a total of nine adult men were observed and eight females from the animal management of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of babies which were taken out of the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample of sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who do not yet have their own offspring re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out to be more quickly to speaker if this calls of the very excited kittens .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sex @-@ ripe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded with &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noise several times in the past .
some studies demonstrated that women were re@@ acted to sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o Marina Sch@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ig@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Archbishop Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; Business &quot; &quot; is announced .
even during the suspension of an emergency , after the overthrow , after the overthrow , the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers cannot be affected .
this does not apply to those who are susp@@ icious , belong to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
and there is no content in front of the football club .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r issued an arrest warran@@ t .
accordingly , in the meantime , the South Sudan is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South kis@@ ses should be adher@@ ence to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
although the condition is valid for 90 days , it is still valid until October , in fact that the majority of the Turks was in fact as good as no impact on the life of the Turks .
the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy &quot; on public places across the country , Erdogan is declared on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - as the whole country - split in followers and enemies &apos; gans .
especially fans of the working class trip are traditionally not to the friends of the President .
what the p@@ light of the Turks but given dramatic experiences in the history , is the strict rejection of military coup .
there even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats up to Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
at Po@@ kal@@ cht@@ ger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially arriving at Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ wins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NAT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and assured his team the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the disappointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the inau@@ g@@ ural K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; appeared also early in the European league .
in the South by Li@@ g it reached only rank six .
the season was not good .
the podium was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we have done and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master visits , the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who ended with 26 seasonal figures as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher heads the base of the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans are hoping for the return of the 31 year old .
at the time of the AC Florence on the treaty , the Gom@@ ez had only exp@@ ired after the coup @-@ &quot; Gom@@ ez &quot; after the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he has to say it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club of Fi@@ xed Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the lin@@ ens must be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around a third of his to 7.5 million Euro vin@@ let@@ ta so that Or@@ man clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary at Florence we cannot pay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite your dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals @-@ chances with Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Justin Gat@@ lin was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa shouldn &apos;t start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh at it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still facing the headlines from the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian b@@ ulation in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , which had caught up after a dop@@ ing Sper@@ re her star law shortly before the games , was bl@@ amed with her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ un@@ ed and bu@@ ked .
it offered a sk@@ id scenery : with a put sm@@ iles , she was still proud into the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
when it stood , that they will not get gold , the public broke out into a bu@@ zz@@ led storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio on the Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked already two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ ad runs from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the greatest chall@@ engers of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m gh@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic @-@ rider and si@@ eben@@ ch world in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after taking the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ ad was tested by 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 on the bot@@ tled stim@@ ul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ id@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic swe@@ pt the wis@@ h@@ ful intake and was locked up six months .
the four broad@@ est throws in this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ride ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Olympi@@ ad and two @-@ time World Champions over 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months locked .
a means of Pen@@ ile Aug@@ mentation may have been responsible , ta@@ xed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is more than 200 and 400 m to the so far quick@@ est man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : apparently hardly any athlete were detri@@ mental to many medals .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been noticed testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
one also recognized bronze medals at the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received due to a judgement of the International Defence Minister CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he lies on rank two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world trav@@ eller and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old world championship in these indications were found on the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement using the Sper@@ re of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austria &apos;s injured - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand in contact with the woman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ em@@ ate early . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have f@@ aded and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
your home journey plans them for the beginning of September .
whether by further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
the State Department also stand in close contact with the local authorities , so snor@@ kel .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a walk @-@ in two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ ar was killed and about 20 people had been injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Italians .
Fre@@ edi@@ an early then two explo@@ sives went high , and according to the authorities there was a further human being killed .
also by Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bombar@@ d@@ ment has been reported in the morning .
in the de@@ ton@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong became a taxi driver after police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country there was another bomb that was killed by an urban setting .
the explosive force has gone to the air according to the authorities in a flower shop before the territory of the territory .
eventually de@@ port@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the southeast coast several injured .
one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , was it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing campaign carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Military @-@ general Dan@@ ai criteria Fre@@ ame@@ av@@ ee free from journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves as possible moti@@ fs - most likely , however , it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern during the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , explained the attacks not in relation to the Islam@@ ist movement &quot; movement or the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been placed .
the authorities would have received secret references to the south of the country in recent days - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places .
it is not clear what group behind the attacks .
the police reported their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand there are still minor bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the dec@@ aying bomb attacks , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities necessarily result .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as pre@@ ah Vi@@ ry and surroundings .
after conflicts between security guards and Muslim populations , there is no need of necessary journeys to these provinces .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) sailed to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday brought a few days after a cont@@ entious referendum held by military jun@@ ta .
this space gives the military large influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs would have been an attempt to infl@@ ate chaos , while the country moves toward stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest holds themselves to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has also failed to cope with the military , who has been able to grasp the rebellion in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok they had been killed on a popular Hindu @-@ shot 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the visionary of the Federal State for Constitutional law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several govern@@ ors also the constitu@@ tion@@ er in the covenant also provided the group under review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic movement &apos; An@@ xi@@ on &apos; to pursu@@ its against the free social democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the immig@@ rant of Islamic faith or from the Middle East has been de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are now monitoring the movement as well .
the &quot; iter@@ acy movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by means of tran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitu@@ ent in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NR@@ W , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; already .
Ma@@ ined said his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities when deciding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally speaking , extremis@@ ts to speak with you@@ thful language often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ists , as well as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a real advertising for your own thing .
propaganda is meant to respond to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; to Af@@ g @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ d@@ ined said he had no knowledge .
in the constitutional order , possible contacts of this species are only relevant to a certain point .
it depends if the respective party - in this case the Af@@ g - through certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist , changing its goals and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
decisive factor is whether such people have remote influence over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase of right @-@ right criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers , and refugee shel@@ ters said Ma@@ ined , he would not speak in this context of new right terrorism .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right@@ ful structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that other legal group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other far @-@ right motives .
but a German @-@ wide or europe@@ wide control of legal frozen is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned himself expressed that many trans@@ gres@@ sions went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ ver@@ susp@@ ects have previously been known as criminal , politically motivated pen@@ al or adher@@ ents to the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed not to prosec@@ ute the crimes previously with legal experts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but who then radic@@ alised by far right wing extremism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : ROB@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes at the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympics or world records the headlines from the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it at the summer &apos;s games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly obes@@ e swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently invited to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a set@@ back of 48 seconds ended its position and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starts .
it was , however , rather its not just sporty character , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special right to law from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries worldwide .
as in Ethiopia , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : ROB@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first sh@@ bos@@ ses made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &apos; The Sun &apos; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him funny .
his time , he only struck at a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ isti@@ l , who did not play a role .
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also pulled .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete for over 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone .
fren@@ e@@ tically was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old got to swim at Olympia just eight months before the competition , and he had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ p@@ ous bal@@ ist not so tight
the Republi@@ can Presidential Office Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election event in Florida .
should it be nothing with the choice of the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative model .
he then drive into the holiday .
lose Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , would it be the relatively in@@ difference : &quot; in the end it will be either to fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a phone interview with the American television broadcast@@ ers CN@@ BC .
if it does not end for him at the end of the reasons for political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he signed the President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance are formed .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership is to dis@@ appoint business numbers
the consumer @-@ based company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market @-@ based company Gf@@ K had been able to guess that the chair of Board of Directors Matthias Hart@@ mann was even more secure , the longer the gains made by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg &apos;s market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appoint business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company &apos;s leadership is the world number five of the industry from a personalized new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P @-@ Executive Board wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K super@@ visory board Ar@@ no Mah@@ m@@ ert has already been made up of the board on the effect of September 12 .
on 1st September , the management board assumed the previous Executive Committee under Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , shared the company with its employees .
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; executive board , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the reason for the retri@@ bution , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ person on Friday .
who will in future be the market research company , is currently still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ münde , it was on Friday , with the shareholders , last but the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring had been re@@ directed in the years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring should not be seen even after 5 years , &quot; says it .
given the last bad Gf@@ K business , every shareholder will eventually become un@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case with BMW , it would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company had not stopped its losses in the preceding quarters , even in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 per cent below the level of the comparable period of the year .
the first half of the year shr@@ inking sales at 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros by 3.4 per cent .
earnings in the second quarter were neg@@ atively bur@@ dened in the face of its difficult economic situation , especially in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the Group &apos;s business experience is necessary in the Consumer Experience division of 139 million euros , and the result was a loss of 14@@ 8,@@ 2 million euros .
Gf@@ K still generated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .

from October 1 , 2016 the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch bald , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must be deeper into the w@@ allet .
the ag@@ it@@ enti@@ er increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board , Herbert Schmidt called on the Panel , a re @-@ calculation of fees for the waste of the market was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 - also over@@ - and sub@@ covers dating from the preceding year period .
the engra@@ ved containers founded in 1960 with all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities with a very low waste en@@ closure , that lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus , due to the small distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious effect .
moreover , the san@@ itation in all three lines is slightly weak@@ ening .
furthermore , the back @-@ time period of all three systems is not least due to its age and repair applications in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plant for cat@@ alogues , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage caused by damage .
in the p@@ umping World War , the company had to over@@ hau@@ led nearly 20 years old funding systems for reason and in the bat@@ ching plant , Lop@@ p has had to take place after nearly 20 years of operation of the first shut@@ ters and an additional ventilation system in order to be able to meet the water legal specifications in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; at these extraordinary expenses , the advanced supervis@@ ors and maintenance costs came to be considered in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone cottages made clear that at low waste water in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt has kept the market community of large entertainment costs at the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above plants will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses on the long run , as you can not extend the supply of the se@@ wage federation of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these plants , because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria ins@@ ed for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that the inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.@@ 2 % were fully booked .
the annual A@@ verage of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of July ( compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.3 % .
in July 2016 , a price increased by the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.1 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) ;
prices fell on clothes and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furnishings , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,@@ 1 % ) .
the prices remained as in pre @-@ month at alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication , and education , unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ ti@@ bel against breeds .
with its filtering tool , it allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can transform herself into pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure which could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ iss@@ ful , unique and unique tools that generate more than 30 million improved afflic@@ tions per day .
all the f@@ uses will come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they have been accused of making the application of Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week proposed some users a filter , which gave them sm@@ s , false teeth and raised whales , there were some critics of a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians - &apos; Yellow @-@ head &apos; .
they asked whether this repeti@@ tive controversy had to be drawn on a larger problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat ap@@ ei@@ gh that it would have disabled the feature disabled .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was thought as an homage to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as a caricature of Asian .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ tful c@@ lich@@ és .
other refra@@ ined from the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student whose twe@@ et over the photographs have been widely spread that the filter &quot; hur@@ tful and least said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ hegemon@@ y of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not a spot@@ ted , but that the Yellow @-@ face was drawn into the throwing extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ inage .
the American culture appears to be involved in an endless range of diver@@ gence and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by race than their older opponents - could expect more sensitivity to sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is abu@@ sive for a user , &quot; so it is much harder to remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided that he works as a product man@@ ag@@ ger and engineer for the medium to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and called for others to do the same .
in a set for medium and in a phone interview , she said that she does believe that r@@ amp@@ ant controversy reflect a shortage of diversity among the practices of sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and finishing in her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin @-@ colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ich @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin @-@ colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers to the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there was Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a consultation , the company has recently focused a recruitment agency that focuses on re@@ presented ethnic groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zh@@ u stated in turn her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military @-@ tra@@ verse ISIS &apos; intelligence information , represents Committee of Congress
military depend@@ ant of the United States Central Command has changed information to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it was allowed to reach the actual state affairs committee in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence Committee , Secret Intelligence Committee and the Wehr@@ Committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how pre@@ tensions changed their assessments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military installations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News &quot; information that are typically fu@@ eled by high @-@ level Cent@@ com comb@@ at@@ ters typically signed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently reported positively as analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; stated a newspaper article .
&quot; what is going to happen at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if poor analyses are presented by our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top @-@ top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed evidence @-@ how in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi army forces .
although there is no direct evidence sug@@ gesting that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ st saw pressure from their supervis@@ ors , an optimal image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , there were a lot of Central Command Press Rele@@ ases , comments and statements about the congress clearly more positive than it reflects the facts . &quot; the report was established .
for example , a Cent@@ com accus@@ ations were publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion .
from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the correspon@@ dent reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans warned the Task Force to Life , after it has been re@@ played that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings while investigations continued .
further investigation in the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ de with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com has created an over@@ ly limited process for drawing up @-@ time assessments to IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the highest ranking democr@@ at in Kom@@ mit@@ es , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ dic@@ ated the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were over@@ ly enough space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats gave no indication of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in previous August , the New York Times of investigations reported by the inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , who were received after complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
In@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress , while the investigation of the inspec@@ tor is still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes contradic@@ gi@@ ate opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data have , and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
inquiries reported on the question of a successful aerial campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement by now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other regions of crisis .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remind of them more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , written contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , only a little occupation forces in Iraq , and little time insisted on thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to specify government notes that would have taken any significant impact on the statement of the terrorist group since these provisional refin@@ eries were taken into operation since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ an command@@ ing command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislative , due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced at the Central Command at Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey on women , a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the American people won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent an awesome performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea , &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to those people who keep their gates .
however , they know that the American people are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in their first place , who remain un@@ defeated in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first lap .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two in their group will attain six teams each in the first and second place .
the first @-@ placed player will take a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead .
whatever the game goes on Saturday , the American people have spar@@ ked their success story after their success story , four years after they landed in the past of London games at the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work in London , which we now have .
we have the rest of the rest can be carried out completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the near @-@ area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
it carried a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ cr@@ ated the ball to the gate to obtain an 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , &quot; but how well will depend on Saturday the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen of trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are up @-@ to @-@ date and in@@ es@@ capable at a more rapid season between competition and quest .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning pillar , which is handed from the bracel@@ et to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athletes .
you cannot switch the TV to listen to a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ k@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is a Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who was for the first time in the Olympic Games , and a woman &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples could have been thoroughly under these known names that were sent to Prime Time , represented by sponsors and wellbeing , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even pur@@ ist .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic Fl@@ ame does not illuminated any event immediately .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not commonly recognized : air@@ brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ plate and may have reign it long .
but if I would say modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it &apos;s made its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so spar@@ ed that many that I had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ ac@@ sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and by 2012 has had an athlete who made it to the final .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share their wives .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ they Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ flow rate , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ istic potential - the kar@@ it@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mble of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the gymn@@ asts and diving , the two sports that make it essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
you will be assessed according to the official Olympics , according to the execution , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ four athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio against each other .
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight on .
med@@ all@@ ers must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down in the playground .
you do not only chase the finish line or the cur@@ b , but also in the TV transmission , another ca@@ ste target : the world or the Olympi@@ ad cor@@ ds .
the targeted aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
this offers the trampoline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the o@@ af @-@ jum@@ per is above .
a advancing movement is not the target .
he or she pr@@ t off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then upwards , then effortlessly back upwards .
also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target , no v@@ ault in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it can only be Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and end @-@ hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , at the Streaming around 13,@@ 00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will e@@ mit the En@@ dr@@ unden as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the mer@@ it and the man@@ oeu@@ vre of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to face air rin@@ se , new fan@@ community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters , the political changes in Ethiopia , came to violent resistance from government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters during the cl@@ ashes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia right now to break together ?
over the past ten years it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid fo@@ e of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months the protests against the government were shaken by the country and in ever more areas .
last week thousands of people s@@ war@@ med down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot on zig un@@ armed demonstrators and killed .
in the run @-@ run videos about the protests most likely from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people hit young people with sho@@ cks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Auth@@ orities for Human Rights is now calling for an out@@ going investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy is expanding at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ant in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was everything else than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , however dissi@@ dents have been sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ ers Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the bottom @-@ use up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
following a highly critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies have been the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tension increases along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for this tor@@ ch , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the national liberation front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which in recent years have become more or less forced to benefit the turbul@@ ence and armed themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of being pursued under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first appears to harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years have been very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheap smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government breaks up access to Facebook and Twitter , what keeps them at regular intervals , especially for protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies which conce@@ al where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians announced that they were so con@@ stric@@ ted to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of prosp@@ eri@@ zed the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mostly in Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was particularly con@@ stric@@ ted to use early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ tian &apos;s Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen by relatively un@@ attended grounds to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
different from Mr. Mel@@ es who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ gia comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was living in an upheav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , that seemingly fu@@ elled from the government and were then stolen from the government .
during the following swe@@ eps have been killed many prot@@ esters , even if there were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively fast over .
development experts from Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal griev@@ ances of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray will be practiced in social media .
analysts say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies have had an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ tures on the neighbouring Somalia , even though she recently rus@@ hed to have closed this base .
while the West will clearly support democracy , it does not want its allies in a already volati@@ le territory collap@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin but@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim to have founded IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by sending his repeatedly repeti@@ tive asser@@ tion that President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State &apos;s terrorist state .
this clari@@ fying statement gave new questions about the communication skills of the Democratic Party of the Republi@@ can Party , whether he would be able to communicate clearly and openly with the American public .
it also puts his collaborators who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in order to declare his / her peculiar position , statements , which he might not have meant .
after having made the hint of an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intended to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a morning @-@ morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ witt MEP Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to weaken the statement by taking it reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential guard does not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of the review pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of cas@@ ino@@ cul@@ ation to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already given sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians should em@@ pack Mrs. Clin@@ ics E@@ mails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans , how they arrive , and then , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction coinci@@ des . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts , who observed the language of both candidates .
but I think it &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of resol@@ ute the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received an even ätz@@ er sound , as his re@@ frac@@ tion@@ ality has gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday showed a lead with a big edge over the North Carolina North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to exc@@ ise himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative comments , he accused his critics frequently to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humour .
but while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought forward his loyal co @-@ troops into the in@@ convenient situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most compelling inter@@ c@@ essors , have been committed to defending the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back sli@@ der , totally wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream public@@ ans try to argue that the government led by Obama , in Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister , ISIS allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump sat down his attacks on the media and cast them out to go around with each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ri@@ mp@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television professionals who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats tou@@ ted above Mr. Tr@@ umps excuse than just a further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential election .
once again ur@@ ging the price from the market , café arrives in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ ed café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years for a good coffee .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front has been pushed away .
the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , made the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals mour@@ n it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ cious city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ine wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is except and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is , it is also a re @-@ finding .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November at Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employees of the old café , the owner and the manager of the new café .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new out@@ office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches along with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural iss@@ ors .
the café serves no more beer , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he has noticed a steady flow of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also afflic@@ ted by rates of Williamsburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was such a customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point it would take the way onto .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee left , she said .
&quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that occurred to me , &quot; she said .
now she has coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inv@@ ari@@ ably the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes the Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said he has not taken a Gro@@ ll on that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie reminds on a special soap for ver@@ b with cold @-@ ti@@ pped coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he is planning to put them out soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has additional advantages .
a local saf@@ te@@ y would like to fill the cold @-@ cool@@ ed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café has expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b reaches out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was my customer , and said he was destroyed in the ground than the café closed .
as the new café opened , Wh@@ ir@@ is said that the operator of the town and the best of a new coffee felt like a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell the war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ample meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as the gour@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
his menu on this day was a modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ aster pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food histori@@ ker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while at its book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ails in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .
goat , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive grove , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixing ate .
as the re@@ porter G@@ br@@ aten , this found the couple for discussion of food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was crude bread , liver cheese and sav@@ est@@ bread .
they were prepared for an ingredient and something cheap , which extends the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ anu@@ ts eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid down in the stomach like this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before Great Depression there was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ way @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ iled for male crops and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who were sent to a hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the ways with which the country had turned out to be no longer the lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating was a central theme for the Americans , &quot; settled co@@ e , why he and his wife would like to write about it .
just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ fulness : mysterious food like lo@@ aves and cold cuts have been re @-@ confidence , the asser@@ ting as &quot; wonderful nature , food @-@ remains re@@ assurance , &quot; noted bricks , because cooks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a mu@@ ddy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap drying .
meat , which was the center of American food for years , became a rare and fourth luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , he prepared bri@@ ck@@ man a court of that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zie@@ gel@@ man leads further from : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the home@@ recipes .
as never before or since then , the bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , the eating habits of the country is good .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become bud@@ get@@ ary women &apos; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical goo@@ d@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty , the reports about the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ eat @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa agrit@@ ourism with his kitchen , he spec@@ ulate like the millions of millions of world to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost @-@ gol@@ d@@ oom @-@ room and carried a tu@@ x@@ e@@ king .
he was delightful realistic .
President Roosevelt may have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book the recru@@ it of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt showed that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most hot@@ test prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected once the country came back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave better understood when writing the book and eating habits of Zie@@ gel@@ mans mother in law - for example , how they couldn &apos;t throw foods away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zie@@ gel@@ man rec@@ rec@@ alled : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there were the wind @-@ tooth decay .
after the plate were ab@@ be@@ yed at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they departed and Co@@ e a dessert that had prepared them at home : the pl@@ ums , the president Roosevelt , had lunch at lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une hip hip , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that it was an exercise trick , humble recipes a fancy name to miss .
there were no s@@ worn cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone ble@@ w a bit reluc@@ t@@ antly one spoon into the che@@ wing , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e fet@@ ched three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do budget , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the line to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar consecr@@ ated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save others the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died on a previous attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group that has saved life according to the image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own life on the line to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help make their first aid in the war .
these are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil officer , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant , from the rub@@ ble of a house , went to the world .
it made the Syrian to the radi@@ ant symbolic character in the atro@@ city of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as heroes he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said loud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself liked to attack the victim , he had talked in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have k@@ icked four stor@@ ef@@ b above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bom@@ bas@@ kets of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland often only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the ship &apos;s ship .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland was only given 150 years in Greenland .
leis@@ ur@@ ely flo@@ ats from Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour , he is at an average of 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal will speed up 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed half as fast as a seal .
that shaped by long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ than@@ lein , from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record .
projected the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist already long ago that Greenland will be st@@ ony .
only missing the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the surface most often only in winter .
researchers know according to the lifestyle of the Greenland science .
her contem@@ por@@ tiv@@ o moderation is what they saw before S@@ val@@ bard six animals with one transm@@ itter .
however , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remn@@ ants of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt for sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses , which tor@@ ch from higher layers of water .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland men , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch of the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k has just 81 cen@@ tim@@ etres long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centi@@ meters @-@ measurement .
to identify the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lin@@ ker of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of shar@@ ks , which are later no longer re@@ done in the proteins .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in Lin@@ sen@@ sed .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as atomic @-@ weapon and large quantities of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .
with 220 centi@@ meters length , the third @-@ smallest animal contained the lin@@ sen@@ kers for a small surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons @-@ weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 with its investigation in 2012 .
in their lime @-@ shar@@ ks , all the major Greenland they had normal carbon @-@ 14 sets which result in the atmosphere through cosmic rays .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock presented for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland at an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k might be with 50@@ 2 centi@@ meters or even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Grön@@ is shar@@ k @-@ females only then offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers were able to assign their length to an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined over 15@@ 6 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be world @-@ ch@@ ord for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in e@@ isi@@ ana waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland , in whose bac@@ on at the neck at the neck for a 120 year old har@@ sh@@ al tip , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on as@@ par@@ lor .
so they mature later - and age slow .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal gives warmth .
the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much bigger than in a grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; says the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ than@@ lein .
a very big animal should be investing more in a long life on the other hand .
construction ground at double pack
with topics around the building , the similarities in the recent meeting has focused on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of relief the Panel accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated living room may start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having clarified the property , par@@ cel@@ ing and subsequent requests and the applications for measurement could be made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( division Bin@@ der@@ straße - section of 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way .
the con@@ domini@@ um is convinced that the b@@ arians in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and rude sen@@ iors equally appeal to appeal equally .
as it was named , construction willing to report immediately in the Town Hall , discussing the allocation of the plots likely to be advised in his September session .
in order to also en@@ roll requests for the relocation of other commercial companies , associated with job creation , decided to re @-@ establish the Municipal Council , which only in the spring of this year would change to a newly created surface plan in sub @-@ areas .
thus in the area of Lower @-@ time , the already designated industrial area is extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from the Bre@@ xit
the main attraction of the city on the Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg wants to attract the best opportunities , from London picked jobs and companies .
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt has benefited most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner , head of Kompetenz@@ fel@@ ds financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether we are allowed to run businesses from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far we have approval in Britain for the so @-@ called EU passport .
these are just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ bying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; pays for five years with 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , says the responsibility of monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance coverage of the IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg , there is a large fon@@ ds@@ man , cutting but also like Dublin at the infrastructure worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt am significantly easier to reach Frankfurt , thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the city with a slightly available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
on the Seine , the rents for first property commercial properties were 50 percent higher than in the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy , the city occupies 10th place seven , Luxembourg in 1st place , Dublin , Square 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain in Europe despite the vote of the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
to do this , the forces of power : in London work according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba to the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent campaign with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. rec@@ ti@@ fier ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs , which have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a damage deposit in the amount of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which covered in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge set a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other atyp@@ ical acts .
when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US ministries in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to leave the cost , which were ar@@ isen during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck has tried to compens@@ ate with Gilead that dominate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took each other def@@ endant and property to laboratory work , which surround Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) dominates after the moving of the still remaining group of fighters that have buried within the city currently the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are heading upwards @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told Re@@ uters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ics earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which revealed a revenues of the Democratic Party of the Democrats and her husband , a revenues of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes was mainly directed at the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated a income of USD 3 million from the company &apos;s Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the State Department .
Clin@@ ics candidate for the Vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his recent ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to uph@@ old standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ ics campaign hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false interpre@@ ters and with@@ drawing with regards to his current promises to publish his tax explic@@ ations .
it is custom@@ ary to post the Presidential candidates to publish their tax explic@@ ations although they are not obligated to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his ref@@ usal of a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; you are on the train &quot; , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the release of the presidential presidency of the Democratic Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can Presidential Office of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already uncovered , that his dis@@ likes issues relating to assets , its donations to charitable organizations , its commercial ties and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already j@@ umped on the topic and published a video on the internet on Friday , in the high @-@ level re@@ public@@ ans of Tr@@ ump immediately asking for its tax declaration .
on Thursday she talked about the subject of a speech in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential institution has done in recent decades and to publish its tax schemes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump during the 1990s did not pay or only very little taxes during the 1990s and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a series of tax hav@@ n and tax advice , the information that this could still be the case .
federal control has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets which would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal likewise .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire Hath@@ or industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump joined a meeting to exchange their tax assets .
Buff@@ ee said he has been subjected to the IR@@ S as well as the IR@@ S and I was &quot; afraid &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities .

conservation in Tanzania use an orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from wander@@ ing in by people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them , which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ce .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation which had already been the idea for years along with the US conservation project trained by volunteers in villages in Northern Tanz@@ as , a non @-@ violent @-@ step method for protection of their houses and harvest without destroying animals .
previously , many sc@@ iss@@ ors have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the telephone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed that ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within this con@@ gregations , with much more confident that they can harm the eleph@@ ants of their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; expressed themselves the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps show the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into one horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ ger@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

however , the request for the new construction of an sales office on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , in the immediate vicinity of the R@@ hen@@ k@@ on building , the city council refused however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new business@@ men but at this location in the exposed situation at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk is not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrate Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ di@@ alling was removed after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has not listed any Israeli pre@@ di@@ aling , since it would have requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ au@@ st@@ dokum@@ entation Sho@@ ah , &quot; he sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via a private call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it , dissolved in the director still more rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the di@@ alling code is er@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the appropri@@ ated by Lan@@ z@@ mann was sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ trading man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were de@@ composed and seas@@ oned by this event .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shame .
this will not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the place to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister of ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident trigger a fairly large response in the internet in which people sc@@ andal@@ ous sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it could have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sh@@ out to you , &quot; said it in another article , in which it was advised that the hotel , which is located on the no@@ id Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly referred all alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fores@@ ee@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , report Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick @-@ list list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .

students put together the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put a tum@@ our and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstrators .
the difficulties began , as police officers , tried to artic@@ ulate the students , which led to the police of rubber and l@@ ur@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , somewhat less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented in order to save money .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT business
according to the lifting of sanctions , led to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading of trade between Moscow and Teheran , in the year @-@ annual comparison of 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest on Russian companies in the country grew strongly , shared the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade of trade between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2015 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports of Iran entered Iran by the US $ 9@@ 1.5 per cent and bore $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year Russian foreign representatives gave approximately 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries which concerns the economy of the economy in Russia .
you could say the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of Mer@@ cy
the Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the seaf@@ aring unit E@@ ger@@ tal Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were traveling in a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been tac@@ kled .
to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ s@@ wir@@ ing of all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the first two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ ten@@ round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage targets was tested and eventually decided for the Ep@@ is@@ sen@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the mercy of Mer@@ cy , which was offered a special pilgrimage .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ lux took their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ ms pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b , we drove by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife stands , and so the pilgrimage route from the Münster was reached .
the individual day@@ trips were ham@@ pered in the morning and in the evening by a short showing with various prayers , songs and lyrics .
but on the way , the Min@@ is went to Mar@@ ches , chap@@ els or churches always R@@ ast to sing together a song from rising pilgrims .
for the nights the parish priests stood at the local parish .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller requested a sav@@ our@@ y and delicious dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ te@@ bach .
tags at this time , the stage came to St. Peter , which was the stren@@ uous way@@ point , had to be climbed around 500 metres of elevation at first , and then climbed again around 500 metres of elevation .
the earned reward was a common gri@@ lling on the beach .
after the morning @-@ impulse of the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing mon@@ ast@@ erial church of St. Peter went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ step to Freiburg .
clearly , and happy the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ j Münster and passed through the gate of Mer@@ cy .
with a small impulse God was than@@ ked God .
in the evening mass in the Münster , the great mines of co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were greeted by the Pil@@ gri@@ ms Min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the service we were able to visit the Sac@@ r@@ isty and the High @-@ altar .
the next day there was time for the Bre@@ is@@ mer Metro@@ polis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community @-@ experience were co@@ ined .
gr@@ otto Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as a Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Men &apos;s team in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the pi@@ vot@@ al role that his Land@@ mark Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned the legend as he made home to get a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England has claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics .
she reiter@@ ated the trick , after it was in March at the World Championships in London despite the set@@ backs Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ ts .
Ho@@ ys retirement asked a gap to close K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained , when they saw potential in the car@@ rots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ s - and Sk@@ inner continued in the qualifying round a Olympic ch@@ ord , but in the still@@ s the New Zealand was victorious on the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
back after his lap , however , Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategic change made a big part of the transformation , in which it drove in a higher gear to slow@@ ing it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on when these climbed to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we have conquered a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the world champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave Hin@@ des that he deliberately left the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Rival .
with such a phenomenal victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the pavili@@ on like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so poorly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation which has been won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer for our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle stream .
with the shape Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he has repeated the victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently common date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
this would be the right of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ Event is always at best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be pushed to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ists on the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest power in the four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world ch@@ ord , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22 / 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins , certainly in focus .
he fought out before the qualification yesterday , when he warned him to measure his height .
in the behalf of the Women &apos;s Competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ ens Laura bur@@ i@@ t , Joanna Row@@ ald S@@ hand , Joanna Row@@ ald S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ ly of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world @-@ arms race in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving his strong rail team to dominate the average period of the Olympic Games and to fetch a ch@@ ar in medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have gone down .
it also played drama &apos;s drama in the background , leaving the res@@ ignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and har@@ b@@ ing@@ es , and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees itself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ b@@ S , who has reached the perfect moment its height again .
future of the melting of Portland because of lifting energy consumption
the future of aluminium sm@@ el@@ ves from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers of workers - are at stake , since plant operators announce the energy supplier and thus lift all delivery services , such as the delivered energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
one for 20 years the payout has been held in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are in the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - may be endangered in closing .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting shop around 10 percent of total electricity Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melting shop , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ ean power station .
the melting away from Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and is ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ ali dollar and last due to the electricity price of the plant .
AG@@ L , which serves the large aluminium mel@@ tdown with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin America , shared with it that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold small shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to be run , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Treaties are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup business@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the black@@ mailing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong exhaust markets for wholesale markets .
AG@@ L said that the value of the contracts is already written in its yearly quarter at the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting shop or to guarantee the power supply to the melting shop &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is yet another explanation as to why it has res@@ igned from the treaty .
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic conditions of the branch off the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually consume around 600 mega@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as an generating set , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ on@@ reality TV star , k@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ty of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ing of the American Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the revelation of the Co@@ vers was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ lyn ) as well as in the presence of the one @-@ hand popular show @-@ un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends with a classical twist : you have all planned a surprise art@@ y .
that represents the we@@ isch@@ ed act of almost every birthday sep@@ tic than a children &apos;s drive ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you can@@ did that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in her other girl somehow to participate in this publicity .
with regard to the Sep@@ em@@ ber@@ th of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ wi@@ hi@@ ans has certainly started .
K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes them as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the edition of the magazine is a league for himself .
the sep@@ ad &apos;s output is the most res@@ ale edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a volume , which is more similar to a fashion label , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling stock 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unvei@@ ling of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is so hand@@ y@@ ant , that in the last two years the magazine has been se@@ ated in front of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebrities , the mod@@ ulas &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; which are celebrities &quot; at the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celebrities are not related to famous individuals or Reality Stars or young people today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all on Jen@@ ner ) .
you are truly talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared at the last cover with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , hunter &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with their Reality TV @-@ story , J@@ enn@@ ers position in the world of fashion was always something tense .
in June discussing the other Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ re@@ pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ iled up once again , when the message with the appear j@@ enn@@ ers appeared at the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the dis@@ grace the point seems to happen at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your land@@ coding of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .

similarities centres per year 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid pres@@ criptions of the country are exp@@ elled annually by the charitable centers , while the industry is taking on the impact of additional medium @-@ cuts on the previous transactions .
in Queensland there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immig@@ rant , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ im@@ ations and similar assistance - with their commitment to free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly loaded , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centre will lose another 30 percent of its funding .
the director of the charitable centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Municipal Centres , had already been rejected by thousands of people every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the end of the vote of the German government .
&quot; Queens@@ lands community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with unmistak@@ able and impressive debts , families who have been dis@@ missed by isol@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just been dis@@ missed - all of these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they may not receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of suffering from Queensland are forced to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
we demand the prosec@@ utor and federal courts and sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these means of SMEs , so that people can get the help they need in judicial problems .
last year the state government met its commitment , funding for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the Municipal Center and its clients , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump electoral campaign charged when employees were supposed to have weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was charged because of alleged in@@ action , having been told that their campaign manager for North Carolina in February have addressed a gun weapon for North Carolina , while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment that was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave to have waited for monthly , that the matter would be regulated internally , before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after compl@@ ained in the local and regional combat unit , B@@ ordin@@ i established that had already had at least four more people the same experience with Phillip - he was in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to do damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation only comes after two days after the Republi@@ can candidate in North Carolina said that the &quot; second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ weapons owners and arms of arms should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judges should appoint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps campaign was clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not stop violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ordin@@ is complaint demands a claims of the campaign for violation of due diligence and from Philip because of bodily injury and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mental damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lost
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses are characterised by the SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributed representative of the opinion pol@@ ls of the opinion research institutions IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition in the north could be ruled out in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
but in both federal states the SPD would have the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to pursue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD amoun@@ ted to 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party thus accounts for pol@@ l only shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 per cent again .
the third place is controversial on the left and the Af@@ g .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , and Af@@ for@@ tes would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country of parliament .
the Gre@@ ens hesit@@ ated despite slight losses incurred by 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) once again in the heav@@ y@@ areas of the country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country date .
in the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives the SPD of the survey showed only 23 percent in the survey ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they are still standing behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ g would represent 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not be missed in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet at Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the successor is dominating the world today - his producer lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty loud .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , which would range for approximately two speakers of high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came out exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the stores - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as &quot; office in the West@@ ein@@ ash@@ en@@ ian format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser , although agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , ie about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of one smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not Nokia .
the mobile @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and trans@@ acted .
the market today control suppliers that were all a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere can be online today , which is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold , about 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple have been sold alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
the global sales with the devices is approximately 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running running of the pay@@ less app providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone has now been created for a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came from early 2007 , at that time , the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet @-@ communic@@ ator , easy to use on touch screen .
the winner of Apple began , still today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had the watch .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention is a matter of course .
in the cut , each Germans now look for 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn all the smartphone also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Management Board at the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent enri@@ chment is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local communities and all over London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ on , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we operated a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new appren@@ tices , some 40,000 jobs to create new jobs and create an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ a@@ ens is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to over @-@ winds , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question to it .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in attractive growth and to leave a legacy to leave the airport as well as in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two busi@@ est cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run tour , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s London games were a great success for Britain and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this olymp@@ ic spirit and create He@@ a@@ throw away as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy from skill and employment , which England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on display @-@ blocking
for companies that make money with online advertising come from one of the software manufacturers to byp@@ ass ads , a &quot; kat@@ z@@ - and mouse @-@ play &quot; alike .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block indication of ads on his desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where it communic@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network once again .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his Des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding with regard to its advertising display , to make it indication of the detection on which part of the page advertising is difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle between the present@@ able open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been underway since the invention of scor@@ ching loos@@ ening in progress , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left social media in the struggle is a strong indi@@ z as worrying indication of advertisers for the industry .
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ fe@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people , advertisers ; almost four times so much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion per day active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ies makes 84 percent of their advertising faces .
the company has installed it on display @-@ block on desktop PCs , because mobile ad blocking can have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs is a sufficiently large percentage of revenue that Facebook makes the investment of such a stri@@ ker as wage worth .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that it was to update his &quot; ad @-@ prize pool &quot; to better control people on them .
on Thursday , Facebook stated that Ad@@ block new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ man from Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indicator blocks are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on Desig@@ ners &apos; tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with gu@@ essed su@@ icide @-@ su@@ icide on the Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway on Thursday in the early hours of the morning with a projected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; into the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a sweat at the age of 49 years , that was transmitted by several vehicles , including a truck , was going to kill herself .
she died on site .
several drivers were already heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who requests that and any witness of the incident .
it was opened up an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; log@@ ically &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter the Le Trib@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not to be held accountable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any of the two cases - when a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the neg@@ atively killing killing was acqu@@ itted after spending a man and killed who was on the A1 of August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the road , and took judgment .
the court set out that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- which had responded to an emergency - to an justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ ese@@ en situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in Morges , should report on the police at the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could be applied to similar conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow re@@ ation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggested that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ war@@ like atmosphere could have had slowly moving slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably rejected more dry lands as de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be protected from more ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS modeling sim@@ mer exp@@ on@@ ates the slow ren@@ unciation of Venus its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds creating something like an umbrella is working to par@@ ach@@ ute the surface from a majority of the sun war@@ ms .
the results are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought by Plan@@ etary Research .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ to much heat and ultra @-@ violet light exposed .
their oceans spar@@ ked and their water vap@@ or was burnt down from ultra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen turned out only a di@@ cke @-@ atmosphere at carbon dioxide from a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy replaces the People of the Aval@@ ans
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado and Vice President of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , who took part in the decision @-@ making process of the team in the decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ics confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as Chief Apostle and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
I have long been thinking about how I could improve this team in the summer to give it more depth , to give it more depth , to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly coordinated with the organisation .
he also needs to have a co @-@ determination right in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic was recru@@ ited from Roy , May 23 , 2013 , and than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick talked about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the Best Trainer of the League .
he carried out the association on 112 points and at first place in Central Vision , but Colorado has been beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference for five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ werk resume talks on strike , strike off
the labour struggles concerning the compensation for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all the parties in the parties sit for a new round of discussion at the table , said negoti@@ ators said .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ites and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution of current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened by approximately 9 percent in the North Sea in the North Sea by approximately 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the enterprise give the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced plans for its part of people and plans to abandon their oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since it is its business activities as a result of his mega @-@ reunion with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , economic situation affecting the British decision in June , the European Union had reinforced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest customs activities , which had been taking place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy which works for many and not only for few &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to attract new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pil@@ es of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ ding tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the ful@@ lest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star &apos;s star .
the new data helps the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars are rotating in star@@ ry at different rates , and in what context the rotation periods are at the planet &apos;s development process .
&quot; we hope that we experience through the comparisons of our results with other constell@@ ations , read more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s inf@@ rar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ wearing of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
you are turning at the fastest .
too leading rot@@ ational rates po@@ ke these po@@ ignant stars and large quantities of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star switch , its rotation begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an recognizable ast@@ ray -- like sun@@ spot -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more intense stars revol@@ ve slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with greater stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
because the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rot@@ ations in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still much more to us what we would like to learn more about how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how , W@@ ann and why stars slow their rot@@ ational rates and speak their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a more controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ star comes off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional set @-@ off release , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be held on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of its New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to this , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game @-@ participants of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez voted for the most valuable player of the league , 2009 he won with the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract depen@@ ded on it since 2007 - 27 million US dollars .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be in full salary as advisor and youth coach - in full salary .
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
however , into the resting @-@ hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls should not be taken up by the 41 @-@ year @-@ old .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have taken effect between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was blocked because of a processing in the so @-@ called bio@@ film sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 2@@ 11 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main susp@@ icious market for years to have obtained an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for the year 2014 even a favor , because I have been performing 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days did not go no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still receive the great stage , Rodri@@ guez had to often sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress Kate Hudson has been said to have sympathy reference to fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a true athlete had almost won a medal .
before the seventh competition day the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming pool in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ nov@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ nov@@ a , and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ z@@ hin@@ sky have been positively tested and excluded , immediately before the commen@@ cement of the anyway critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages go to the accident .
in the past Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven that it is used as a mas@@ on medium for dop@@ ing sub@@ missions .
the International Sport@@ s@@ court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds it missed the bronze medals .
on Friday Chen had to participate in the footh@@ ills of 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Chen has filed the opening up of the B @-@ sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association adop@@ ts the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Chen &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the CA@@ S is responsible for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
likewise , at the night of Rio the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ nov@@ a goes through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
you may be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics .
according to the report , it is intended to act on the forbidden substance of the blood @-@ dop@@ ant EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ nov@@ a has been used for the time , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample would also have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately made criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
thus , for example , it may not be possible to participate in the chron@@ ically @-@ wearing nation from the chron@@ ically @-@ wearing nation in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London olymp@@ e@@ ger was tested in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been positive on the an@@ abolic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ lon .
both disp@@ ar@@ ate the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ nov@@ a is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association of IA@@ AF did not prohi@@ bit the entire Russian team to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing dop@@ ing , also the runner in Kenya is producing many poor news in Rio .
in the pool , the previous Ver@@ sions in China had also taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes .
as the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ ve Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ le li@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ ou@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ at , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships as well as the Tri@@ on@@ ans of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only a three @-@ month lock had had to sit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daten@@ k@@ lau : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ resses h@@ acker in money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
programmers of compres@@ sive mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware defense specialists from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies surv@@ eyed over the past twelve months were at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of the companies were once the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware .
40 percent of the victims paid willingly to the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators , in order to be able to use the embedded systems and data again .
the perpetrators are specialized their black@@ mailing @-@ software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially @-@ pressing ran@@ som will considerably higher than for individuals .
&quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening rapid evolution of pollut@@ ants , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered creators for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she searches for un@@ seen files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as for archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the black@@ ma@@ ins .
in order to get the final enco@@ ding code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ genetic Bit@@ coin .
but where in private use the personal photo database is at stake , it deals with companies to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls from when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of affected German firms affected by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to cut business operations completely , in case they were people of life .
in Germany several times of victims were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickness .
&quot; we say to the victims always : pays , it only enhances the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators .
the h@@ acker in turn knew that and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Sec@@ ure have examined the pay@@ able areas and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their sacrific@@ es by chat on how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access @-@ to @-@ access support websites , or de@@ code for free example files .
and if individuals are dis@@ car@@ ving after payments of a few hundred euro , companies must take part tough and five @-@ digit sums have to pay for their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits out of the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail the h@@ acker becomes more professional and share the work , explains security @-@ experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , that these are three or four persons .
the programmers are selling their contam@@ in@@ ants in the form of a software construction .
the pre @-@ existing Mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware even , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adap@@ table tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ma@@ ins are then searching for more h@@ ackers in order to spread the freshly caught software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you can log into one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts a further one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ activated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the criminals carry the sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known in many companies , who better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the company IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey can be trusted to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetrators are instead occupied with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price levels , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
thus the damage @-@ potential is higher than before the type of data is much higher than before .
the perpetrators might be able to take fully new goals on the internet of things in the future .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers as they were able to get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the bol@@ ting of such un@@ obstruc@@ ted heating could be really worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators are then instead of heating in the future an entire production road block in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware might also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will put up everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini @-@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the ond .
the materials inside the interior are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is off there .
versatile vehicles are the HR @-@ V storage .
it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with elevated and 10@@ 26 l in un@@ folded back pain , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds like : the dor@@ sal areas of the back bench can be lit up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and therefore offer storage space , which is height from the floor up to a height of 1.@@ 24 m .
the suitcase is well loaded , however , the battery @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 N@@ m in wide turn@@ key areas very powerful .
but he is likely to do some qui@@ eter in his work .
the everyday consumption is of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there are another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an All@@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; is no wish un@@ fulfilled .
for the safety systems belongs to the City of Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ system and the sp@@ ur@@ ary assistant .
the coll@@ isions are ir@@ ri@@ dden sometimes because it evaluated many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; in the ran@@ ger .
very reliable works in the remote @-@ light assistant .
and the intelligent tempor@@ al regul@@ ator re@@ acts to the traffic detection and th@@ rot@@ tle when needed the speed .
however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are under arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel is fine .
who does not want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro .
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ day car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing for air passenger
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air passenger .
for a liability is conceivable only with dangers which are typical of air traffic , argued the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the down@@ fall of a knee .
but the accident could have happen everywhere - it is a general risk of living , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
suffering vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back after their trip , if the cause of the disease is doub@@ tless in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the tra@@ ded case a family was heavy on the second day of their door . it was heavy to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent nearly all of the holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a broken de@@ pl@@ ain@@ ment that was said to poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip had been inadequate and def@@ endant against the promot@@ er .
in the court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
although the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was indeed faul@@ ty .
but the organizer only received just before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of it .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information duties , thus the judgment .
especially since in the rehear@@ sals of the water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through infection among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 000 guests who have been suffering from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said de Mai@@ zi@@ ère after the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about other attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state would have to n@@ ish and determined to respond to the terror at the same time .
of course our country will not answer the perpetrators of perpetrators of hate and division .
we will never give the terrorists the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , he would increase security and increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ able strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ sized sizes over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be again on punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , which is re@@ manipul@@ ated by arms law , especially when purchasing weapons in the internet .
the last much discussed c@@ p@@ light for physicians should remain protected by de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; regul@@ ator , as the dangers of citizens can be reduced , he spoke with a view about mental symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to enter the application of investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior decided clearly against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a hearing for the sni@@ ff@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ation ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality previously .
a general ban on the enforcement of enforcement is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
one cannot deny everything that one re@@ jects , and I reject the bur@@ sts of the Bur@@ ka .
talking about rules about road transport or for witnesses on trial .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the Minister to sim@@ ulate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages and adap@@ t@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Manager Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et sp@@ ans and a tigh@@ tening of the common law bring people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic con@@ flu@@ ence on the Autobahn
it is up regularly on the mainstre@@ et - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the legal disp@@ le@@ ction should be extended .
this is good news for all lor@@ ry drivers who travel at the ambient road every night in St@@ au when crossing the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road station road construction extends the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the downhill Wes@@ eler Street for the right to 700 meters .
drivers can then pick up straight from the hammer street right .
the big advantage : the traffic shares early while allowing the aggre@@ gate process to improve on the subject @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of representation Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the train ride becomes nervous the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 19 hrs .
the return to the bridge over the Sloven@@ e Path is sometimes enough to the bridge and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle at the B 51 just before the departure of Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic is only guided on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be res@@ umed well in three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge can no longer have the required carrier to take up the heavy traffic in two ways , above all .
how long is this bot@@ t@@ len@@ ght and the associated traffic jam will last not say in the relevant state @-@ operation .
however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the length@@ ening of the legal disp@@ ens@@ er the state @-@ operation has deliberately picked the limited time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to calculate .
the traffic will pass by on Tuesday and on Wednesday on the job@@ site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning denom@@ ination &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theatre Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of staging at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Small House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools will be able to visit schools with welcome classes as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young people in the class are from September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German .
thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the s@@ zen@@ ic pictures and video animations , it may have been possible to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boy The@@ ater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from spra@@ ying , and the young theatre will collaborate in the upcoming season as part of a musical project .
from October to December young people with and without any escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will get the opportunity to professionally managed courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatri@@ cal language skills are in the planning .
the project &quot; intercultural journey &quot; continues .
in the face of the Ascen@@ ded refugee numbers , the Association reck@@ ons with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ry : hope of we@@ ather@@ ation
the weather has made the star @-@ nu@@ dges in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night on Friday a line through the bill - but there is hope .
the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain , to observe the kingdom spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many star@@ ry locations in the sky .
the star@@ ters are Per@@ rop@@ es , which belong to the fastest star@@ ry with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they seem to have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping .
in the evening you are going around for ever@@ lasting , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is far from waking up to sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult in@@ gestion experience and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there may be many causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German society for sleeping research and sleeping .
what you understand during the time is the in@@ som@@ nie , that is a one @-@ way or a sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder .
just that many people experience as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , leader in the German Haus@@ smann association with practice in the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , mental or mal@@ icious factors , but also drugs are stuck .
it is not seldom that sleeping @-@ disorder is an expression of a different condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is common especially for depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors are working together .
those who for example has a sli@@ pped disk can lie bad , wake all two to three hours and begins to greet about everyday problems and -@@ worry , there is we@@ aver an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
those who are not sleeping well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and that day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , advises We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment can look quite differently : one is tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ ood@@ iness or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to relie@@ ve the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options occur among other things behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medication - classical sleeping @-@ coated tablets just in an emergency and maximum for two weeks .
there are hardly hal@@ low ones in Germany , stressed Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should consult with sleeping problems first at the home doctor , advises We@@ e@@ ß .
it can clear up with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was to be in sleep , and what happens there ?
for the examination in the sleeping laboratory - in case of snoring with respiratory disorders , in path@@ ological daily @-@ fatigue , at dormit@@ ory or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the study itself .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not take a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after c@@ abling , one goes to his normal time in bed .
beside the electro@@ des on the body you carry a no@@ zzle , a chest strap , and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger .
also draws a camera on the ceiling to the sleeping .
how can victims get a grip on ?
there are quite a lot of positions on which one can put a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is counting on : regular bed@@ time and rising times , not to sleep long in bed , do not sleep watching TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and look at night not at the clock - then you begin to reck@@ on immediately , and that is totally and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V Team at the Olymp@@ us team .
in December 2014 he had brought the first gold champi@@ onships for the first time in Doha and thereby started to record his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has placed on Facebook protected in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues .
&quot; in a country in which a Olympi@@ asi@@ ve receives 20,000 € em@@ mie and a jun@@ k qui@@ ver 15@@ 0.000 € should no one worry about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his fac@@ ebook page .
the convey@@ or system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls however very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and don &apos;t even see and operate the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; he explained further .
wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler should be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( N@@ ada ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain period before World Cup / OS by independent controllers the W@@ ada / F@@ ina may not take part , &quot; calls on the election of Hamburg , who has now running an ice cream .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ th@@ ie@@ eben :
professional Die@@ be at the Airport Düsseldorf
in Thursday , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police managed the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ s- and pan@@ nier bags .
at 21.@@ 30 pm civil servants involved in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known to the poli@@ cem@@ an from past theft .
the two women and two men had been committed to a number of off@@ ences since the middle of July and were very professionally engaged .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can follow the de@@ priv@@ ation that were killed on behalf of criminal offen@@ ders in Germany , four actions .
in the process they had collected a total of over 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , a few lin@@ ers , are still a rest of the cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ ean street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in appears at first glance , but the police belongs to the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from the east to the west , one passes by playing places , a newly built kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a gray house someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ges@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ d@@ l , which should soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new flats will be created .
articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as described in the relevant property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , however , are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , in the meantime the residents have rented contracts , on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events .
in the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel in Berlin had repeatedly called for a hard drive to the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 known as the starting point of an autonomous violence .
after having given the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks with official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three men &apos;s cars on site , un@@ restricted parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the uni@@ denti@@ fied home owners the rooms .
on 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later the police and builders were driven by sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street acts peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking pre@@ matur@@ ely .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main locality of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in the Kiev since 1999 and Jan@@ a * , who here raised three children , are mainly attri@@ but@@ able to the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern of rising rents and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kiev , who wish to rep@@ ent in front of v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left in front of v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
the dit@@ ch , who captured the Berlin cour@@ sen@@ ator and the police between domestic occupied and their neighbors , does not seem so obvious .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was a traditional worker neighborhood , which also has a lower average of poverty today compared to the rest of the city .
also home @-@ ups and the resulting living projects have been occupied for a long time since 1990 : in 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared together in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ ean and are partly occupied by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become increasingly becoming magnets for tourists and ball@@ ber@@ liner from around the world : with them the inhabitants of GDR @-@ times and former domestic occupied their Kiev .
this is also noticeable in the rents that have risen since 2009 for about 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one re@@ alizes it to a sli@@ pped sli@@ ces or freshly squee@@ zed fac@@ ades that have been tos@@ sed with color .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words of &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours might consider that as a problem , it could not necessarily be affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury , according to polic@@ emen .
most of the criminal off@@ ences make kind charges , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is un@@ important : people at 94 are their neighbours , they have not been determined .
even the famous fl@@ amm@@ ers there are also no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga Street - and stayed there .
that is why it was so important for her to get back down its road : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly interfer@@ es in the district of the district in July .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants , like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by spot@@ ted new builds in former construction gaps , which sup@@ press the old inhabitants .
&quot; they are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well be@@ wil@@ dered , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely not a healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do , if one never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is a frustration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
for zu@@ iled , who like about colour bom@@ bed , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
who draws , should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain badly about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for the integration and organizer .
furthermore , it is a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ics support the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all players : refugees , working child refugee , administration , authorities and who else is mis@@ leading .
Reg@@ ine customer from the work circle indicates that volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ t now is there , the secret wool of wool , which primarily has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cked as much as on the multitude of wanting @-@ areas ou@@ tre@@ ble - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for a administrative office with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ hol@@ ograms &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , working with the local people and also behind the scenes , as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot for three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ a- and full @-@ time actors support .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers are soon available in the washing machine
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connectivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connection , which have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you need to place the refugees in their own or rented residen@@ ces .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations need to bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the European Security Council to the Commun@@ e and job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been quite difficult for some time .
in fact the administration does not find private apartments .
they did not work until now , while you are reli@@ ant on private apartments , as Deu@@ t .
therefore , non @-@ inflammatory apartments must be made , as it is so nice .
so , soon new containers are soon set up in the washing machine .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a firm place , it is practic@@ able , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and training courses for refugees and migrants that need to be up or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; said Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very or@@ derly , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
she hopes that working for communities leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity means not just work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of revenge .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here we jump here management and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time meaningful for them , for example with language courses .
those who at some point have the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not be able to work and be useless , but will never be integrated .
the clear majority was motivated .
but problem cases are there , says customers honestly , &quot; people , at which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others .
all this has already been a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some could call &quot; What some na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; a res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not exclude it however .
but the auxili@@ aries are already sensitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents also be subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in dis@@ member@@ ment .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main - and hon@@ orary volunteers are to be held on site and in the region according to activities .
yet they always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ ß could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , do not shy away from politics .
actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher also claims to be sensible at the present time .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
chim@@ ney : sought @-@ in with helicop@@ ters
the police force flew different areas for about one hour or so - was un@@ successful .
two UFO men are on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 h viol@@ ently absorbed into an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the people surprised the two and struck the de@@ for@@ de in the run .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ k@@ ated , the two Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis .
it runs in the direction of the city .
for the flag@@ ging , the police put several strikes and a police h@@ ub@@ helicopter .
the flag@@ ging went without success .
perhaps the un@@ know@@ ns fell short of the flat near the apartment and with their escape .
