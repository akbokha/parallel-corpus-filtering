<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">To invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - this is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unone, however, the two US foreign applicants are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a more basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to stay small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to underestimate the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Himself by contrast it would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively fall back regulations and he makes up for a far-reaching tax reform with lower wheelsets strong - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton then says: the state has certain duties to meet, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton have almost worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic Applicin announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the national-critical tea-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, we could post-party discussions yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and updrive down coal mining in the US." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also supposed to be possible in far-protected areas, the Paris climate change agreement he wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton in contrast wants to expand renewable energy with its investment programme:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both countries do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">The aim is to be paid better then also, is called Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance.</seg>
<seg id="27">They want to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump in this question wants to do is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage must pass, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold on him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least want to demand the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who are alone to flee almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a great kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at a maximum of one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her small son in her arms.</seg>

<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the business manager of Condrobs, a bearer of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are air-minded.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's north in one of the few decentralized accommodation available for allying women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro family and the Munich's aid aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unfortunately, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not excessive to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hopper-bearer after Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">In women there are other reasons for the flight: "many steal steal secretly because they do not see a different way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home country they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, honorary morden, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon."</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, narcise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too many women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and is misabused.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to about 90 percent of women living in the Munich's north in Munich, appreciates it.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar to that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since she is often not kissed to help, it needs more accommodation just for them, asking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven district governments are responsible for the lodging of refugees in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they widens from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers with no.</seg>

<seg id="40">In Schwaben, too, women are not housed alone, "said Karl-Heinz Meyer, press review of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are in some common shelters or own homes only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The assistance of the assistance experts have called to authorise their trade union to approve new labor law in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin invited his Turkish counter-player in the Congolstadt Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny myself to the invade that Ankara is seeking to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles seemed sloped and he barely made heat out, even for his back to the conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan should have behaved so badly as if it had never done anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">For me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin showing radiant, sustainable cooling, that the President of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in its introductions: the shutdown of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow was rejected by the reaction of the time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin spoke and accused Ankara, Russia fell into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To re-establish cousin is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the nationally controlled media led a fierce, unlimited attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed like the Turks to carry the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the most serious accusations were the allegations of senior officers that could have benefited from their own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He did not deny this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only because Putin from President Erdogan he received the apology he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">To Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed by all friends he can get, after he got the last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attack on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number rose by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recorded again." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecast the state television cheaper, fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian imported goods are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vejsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West because of its reaction to the tried power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this will come to the continuing Groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to draw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian President in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that he tried after the tried coup to support the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow is a matter of course, which itself has a deeper fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one of the way it was described by an analyst, portraying the "Alliance of external sideways." two countries who violate themselves off the West and are being treated poorly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently faced the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be indicative that after almost three hours of initial conversations, both President on the press conference said they had not even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey had intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this decision.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of its potential for a complete disaster, as the NATO member Turkey abstened the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads will at least talk together.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has released unexpectedly his Staff, Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narrowest of confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed for the special commissioner for environmental and transport facilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has arranged without giving reason" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been the "Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Tallinn, he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later worked as Chief Executive and Chief Executive Committee of the Reset personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment," "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as head of State, legislative and controls for implementing your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin sent the Russian television broadcaster on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was long time in one of the narrowful Vladimir Putin's and works as he was in the Soviet service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the staff went back to his own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, here are only a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">I know that no one at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was touted as a potentially president, would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - bumped on to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "" "it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power he called Ivanov than one out of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term as a third presidential coup against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin has become prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queensney Crossing with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four consecutive "covers" which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "he said:" "" "this is an historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensney Crossing." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a touchy activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge at their place and the last section of Decks will take place in Rosyth today in Rosyth. what means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of the trendsetting high and deep underground.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road section and its connection with the northern shore deck, we had to closed the existing gap in the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very difficult activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct 222 meters long is, approximately 6000 tons weight and at a slope of about 3% had to be drawn up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child to play out no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with screens on screens, has been beamed over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I personally refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a draw series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of popular culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand, sank in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that the server overtook.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphone go outside and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, then joined the watchman and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable rise in steps, which rejects the average "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an App for Apple Watch, which tracked 35.000 users, shared the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch the game, the number of followed people who aping each day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only provides the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to get involved "take 30 minutes" to get active from the sofa 'and' every day to be active. they came to be dove ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sport, reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people make even new friendships at the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are murderous toys, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even when smartphone apps like FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activites in the real world and assist many people in hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="12">The American Simone Biles turers on the float while the women's multi-campaigning during the Olympics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-struggle title, and in total the fifth, while they solidify their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world championship - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that included a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said that she is the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a final test of Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden-dimensioned expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school escape into the gymnasium, in which Boorman was trained, became power.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not lost since the summer of 2013, a multi-struggle competition has been lost, which will last as long as it wishes.</seg>

<seg id="27">Brigaken and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holding the world title - lauded.</seg>

<seg id="29">Raisman embraced them gently than they expected their final, - pure formality - and tears currents on Biles gleaming red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision they described once in their collection book, became reality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we Simone, Gabby and Laurie need</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to me under the women's olympic office and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been in case of every summer olympic program and the U.S. has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turnermen, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, which inspires for many young girls of other skin-color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdine is and Madison Kocian, which is Katholikin, rounds, makes every pride.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was among the female turnered an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics and honed America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but mastered gymatic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was praised the fourth, heterosexual American, who won in an individual multi-struggle event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but so the classes throughout the country do not look out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to manage it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last Five," because the next Olympic team will only have four turnerers in the crew. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that gymnasts is a more expensive sport and gymnasts will be primarily combined in private gymnasium, which will be maintained for training, furnishing, travel and hotel costs (for the coach and their turner and families). the list can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the gymnasts get their entire training and that is for families a teens and long term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, instructor of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to get inspired the congregations of countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, making an affordable and easy access to gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my Turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable matches in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turers who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="26">Drying develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers long-term benefits for health as well as school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this crew, who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" gives you so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per day drug, after being advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period.</seg>
<seg id="3">The setting-using drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repetitive heart attack for people with a cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, whereby the risk of a stroke is reduced or another heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">The regulatory authorities NICE of NHS has recommended for a maximum of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attack and stroke are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arteries, the inscriptions are formed.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the Belag breaks, it can cause a blood clots, that ceps the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots solves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who had already had a heart attack, will subject to a higher risk to another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company Astrazeneca, and under the trade name Brilique is reduced, reduces this risk by making the formation of clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The implementation design of NICE, which was released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with one twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health-assisted Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack, have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively helps in reducing further heart attack and stroke cases with people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor we are happy that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from them.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular the risk of blood - is restricted to a period of up to three years. suspension design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals concerning the promotion of bowel bacteria, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind, which he chased, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been well known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railroads to train stations to rinsing manoeuvre of restrooms, the task set its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he told, "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what affects my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed, with which the B is rearranged, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible of construction work, which begin at 5.30 o'clock in the morning and end until at 8 pm, there is always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite a crisy," told Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet-Gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>

<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south half-time scheduled to the south, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The object is also redeemed for the construction work, for example, when it comes to setting up perseverance trips.</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," he responsible for the transport-technical management of the refurbishment leader Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bach, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many scammers searched and rather their Navi trusted as the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some truck in dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since also the speed bumps are not observed, the community also sought out the Messaging vehicle from Mössing.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt called on a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the reference, the guest-site benefited otherwise from the advantages of location on the B. now, they must also bear the disadvantages, which result in restoration.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something had been acquired with funding.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all lawsuits, Göhner is sure that its restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family run has been settled since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now less often subject to complicated traffic-management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can not go down, it is also somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">That its tribal clientel after the end of the restoration work again, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>

<seg id="24">It also has unfolded and leaves questions frankly.</seg>
<seg id="25">And in some points - with the unequal treatment of patient - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually purchases sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle-age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the Commentary Commentary to the commentary in order to oversaw him under the alias of non-old men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov the complex redevelopment of vinyl was not based on a boom in millennials that would like to greet the news of physical objects, but to the Midlife Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are of all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older records retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest pit, before I stay steamed, my hands hold and something determinant as: "so, let's have a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slow due to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where the independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman the camera to turn off the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle aged men, a woman, presumably the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and going through the stores to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These gramophone, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I am not responded to him at home) dress up the walls of his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and buy items that he sold, when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, who was released when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, are more introverted and liked to spend their own time, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my case.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, thinks that many customers meet, which he meets at the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe people who heard about the comeback, and will be able to see their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually have been drained in this way around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who were once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the records of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers attended the contact with the non-contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turnfans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sounding envelopes, of objects, the lucky Jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think, sometimes it may be the colt of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector and I think it's so good with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally engaging.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flushes an employee of a label.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record last month, they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% own a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I blows at the stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio head silplate, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More production, less music clasant.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly purified.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop that has dedicated the noise almost a whole floor has a blower audience, as I go clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts neuester Synthesizers and sexcpackers Pop instead of experimental jazz - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but some mental traumas are hard to be ascertained if one stands beside someone in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for several minutes and considers the varietown of the drives.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a mannequin than a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore, collecting plates is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... it is driven with a man-loved sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of records.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to muting the jeans's hotspots, I watch a group of young teenager, who group for a moment on the polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think, to buy a crosley plate.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put it on.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items can mean more money for the industry and give some customers in the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one who gives the most for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov agree, they are at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, records and in online stores exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through record stores of Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while they steer the rigible view of an uncanny, 30-year false moderator that protrudes over the shoulders of nothing of middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening for a ruthed stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit by a result of 43-7 at the Degree stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stepping, paves, line-run and roher power to win Gold - her first Olympics of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat was won by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Bocs, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day might fall to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji on this form could have been a 15-man team in form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal at his neck: Fijis Chefcoach Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game of the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This workbook will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks GbS have fun of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau going over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai has yet another attack on the right-hand corner that he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly announced the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hevoring Tackle von Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner is a touchdown, and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning since the infiff and there was still more than a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tackled of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, as if Fiji was born about it to play the 7 while UK is still unseeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijiese gap... for quite four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua ran Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game worked for a long time in favor of South Ossearaner, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame sat the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle, the Fijis hugged and GB kicts crushing out in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji Japan had conquered Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and the UK pressed South Africa in a half-final match from the race - British conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the bok in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton passed the line with an impressive kick-work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-minute team, captured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for a stroke of rowing</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinalerts gold than in these games and that wants what is hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke until the last, 220 hard Hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it were only the confessions that were sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was omnipresent as she was at the second Olympics in two without the tax lady, the first women in the history of British sport which laid upon such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unloaded use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which is not the kind of the Triomphe says to geze.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion to wilder helpers who make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach who was not aware of about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed at all cancer than was diagnosed with him.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and this they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment early 2014, out of season, could begin to keep the break down a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran out around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory, their first thought of Williams, who had a nerve-taking morning to talk a little more than otherwise, tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was considered captain in the Royal Arllery regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that might be something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It's just repeated, how much me this means, how much I and Helen and also the Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive Thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to carry or wish a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even at the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark reached, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called for the "stay in the process," stay in the process. "</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we didn't look out to make a difference.</seg>

<seg id="7">Most Seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, the seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because they often solve social and family structures at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made URSEL Kipp in their choir:" "" "speaking and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, exercising a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as the doll as well in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about obtaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says of the German labour community of seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In older generations, the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or hearing aids in older people stirs many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially tunes, it denses itself against ill people in a long way.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Simultaneously focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are not only able to focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: when I go for something for a long time, I will better and grow beyond me - this experience will strengthen.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, betraying Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't get it alone - with 50 sinking people who hears a tone next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer you have seniors several ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the acquaintances in a seniors, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer insights about the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours around help with the internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul is doing good and has something freeing - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week proposed some users a filter, which gave them sms, false teeth and raised whales, there were some critics of a racist caricature of Asians - 'Yellow-head'.</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repetitive controversy had to be drawn on a larger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat apeigh that it would have disabled the feature disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was thought as an homage to Anime-characters and not as a caricature of Asian.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders that have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other refrained from the anime comparison.</seg>

<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu decided that he works as a product managger and engineer for the medium to delete her Snapchat account and called for others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom accusations were publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls can already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, is so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congress from Kansas, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the mid-year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the correspondent reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans warned the Task Force to Life, after it has been replayed that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings while investigations continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">Further investigation in the Centcom reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Defense Department.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincide with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created an overly limited process for drawing up-time assessments to ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "given the highest ranking democrat in Kommites, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion known." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, such as Mr. Ship," "", "delayed the publication of subsequent reports," "" "pedicated the moral under analysts and" "" "were overly enough space for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Ship and Democrats gave no indication of an intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts regarding a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">In previous August, the New York Times of investigations reported by the inspector of the Pentagon, who were received after complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Inmdr. Patrick Evans, a press review of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress, while the investigation of the inspector is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes contradicgiate opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data have, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">Inquiries reported on the question of a successful aerial campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement by now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other regions of crisis.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remind of them more than ten years ago, as an Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, written contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only a little occupation forces in Iraq, and little time insisted on thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to specify government notes that would have taken any significant impact on the statement of the terrorist group since these provisional refineries were taken into operation since these provisional refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this knowledge was not published, the Times in September reported.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms daman commanding command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative, due to its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced at the Central Command at Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The U.S. wins fourth match in the field hockey on women, a showdown with Britain.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American fieldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the American people won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent an awesome performance, but Bam (27) said, she could not remember that ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to those people who keep their gates.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that the American people are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in their first place, who remain undefeated in their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two in their group will attain six teams each in the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed player will take a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game goes on Saturday, the American people have sparked their success story after their success story, four years after they landed in the past of London games at the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years she became a national player in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rest of the rest can be carried out completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a backhand from the near-area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the match from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It carried a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flank, then moved into the middle and lucrated the ball to the gate to obtain an 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last district.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham said, "but how well will depend on Saturday the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, Zen of trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are up-to-date and inescapable at a more rapid season between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning pillar, which is handed from the bracelet to the swimmer to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot switch the TV to listen to a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is a Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who was for the first time in the Olympic Games, and a woman's warm with dimples could have been thoroughly under these known names that were sent to Prime Time, represented by sponsors and wellbeing, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even purist.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame does not illuminated any event immediately.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not commonly recognized: airbrush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastplate and may have reign it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would say modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it's made its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so spared that many that I had asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympiacsport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and by 2012 has had an athlete who made it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share their wives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rothey MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The jumping on a trampoline has a certain outflow rate, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humistic potential - the karitonous tremble of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the gymnasts and diving, the two sports that make it essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be assessed according to the official Olympics, according to the execution, difficulty of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-four athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight on.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallers must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, up and down in the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not only chase the finish line or the curb, but also in the TV transmission, another caste target: the world or the Olympiad cords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the oaf-jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A advancing movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prt off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then upwards, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vault in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It can only be Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end-hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, at the Streaming around 13,00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will emit the Endrunden as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the merit and the manoeuvre of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley expects his to face air rinse, new fancommunity.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters, the political changes in Ethiopia, came to violent resistance from government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters during the clashes with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right now to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid foe of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months the protests against the government were shaken by the country and in ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people swarmed down the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the run-run videos about the protests most likely from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people hit young people with shocks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authorities for Human Rights is now calling for an outgoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy is expanding at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendant in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was everything else than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, however dissidents have been silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seers Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the bottom-use up to the stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a highly criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies have been the last seat of the opposition, and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tension increases along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this torch, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have become more or less forced to benefit the turbulence and armed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of being pursued under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears to harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheap smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government breaks up access to Facebook and Twitter, what keeps them at regular intervals, especially for protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies which conceal where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians announced that they were so constricted to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of prosperized the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mostly in Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a nonpublicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly constricted to use early signs of discontent and to use special officers to process opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Haitian's Desalegn, was chosen by relatively unattended grounds to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Different from Mr. Meles who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailegia comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was living in an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, that seemingly fuelled from the government and were then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps have been killed many protesters, even if there were less than in recent months and this time of unrest was relatively fast over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts from Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievances of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, a amharian city, of Tigray-guided businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray will be practiced in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies have had an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronentures on the neighbouring Somalia, even though she recently rushed to have closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West will clearly support democracy, it does not want its allies in a already volatile territory collapses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim to have founded IS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by sending his repeatedly repetitive assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State's terrorist state.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying statement gave new questions about the communication skills of the Democratic Party of the Republican Party, whether he would be able to communicate clearly and openly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also puts his collaborators who make an effort to take him during an eventful phase in order to declare his / her peculiar position, statements, which he might not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint of an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really didn't intended to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a morning-morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt MEP Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement by taking it reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential guard does not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the review prasselt on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of casinoculation to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Referring to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already given sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians should empack Mrs. Clinics Emails, but later he said "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans, how they arrive, and then," clarify "depending on how the reaction coincides." said Ruth Sherman, a communication experts, who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think it's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of resolute the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has received an even ätzer sound, as his refractionality has gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday showed a lead with a big edge over the North Carolina North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tried to excise himself for his provocative comments, he accused his critics frequently to distort his statements or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought forward his loyal co-troops into the inconvenient situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most compelling intercessors, have been committed to defending the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Giuliani was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back slider, totally wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream publicans try to argue that the government led by Obama, in Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister, ISIS allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump sat down his attacks on the media and cast them out to go around with each of his words and be taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he rimped the" "" "poor," "" "television professionals who try to understand and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats touted above Mr. Trumps excuse than just a further proof that he is inappropriate for the presidential election.</seg>

<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabine wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is except and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York change is, it is also a re-finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accept credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland often only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board the ship's ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland was only given 150 years in Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely floats from Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, he is at an average of 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal will speed up 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">That shaped by long-term lifestyle seems to be a silver bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuthanlein, from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Projected the evolutionist biologist already long ago that Greenland will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the surface most often only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know according to the lifestyle of the Greenland science.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her contemportivo moderation is what they saw before Svalbard six animals with one transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, this sharks make this sharks still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt for sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for carcasses, which torch from higher layers of water.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland men, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch of the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark has just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeters-measurement.</seg>
<seg id="22">To identify the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the linker of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of sharks, which are later no longer redone in the proteins.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in Linsensed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as atomic-weapon and large quantities of this radioactive carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimeters length, the third-smallest animal contained the linsenkers for a small surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons-weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 with its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lime-sharks, all the major Greenland they had normal carbon-14 sets which result in the atmosphere through cosmic rays.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock presented for a 493 cm long Greenland at an age of 335 years, while the record-shark might be with 502 centimeters or even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönis shark-females only then offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign their length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined over 156 years, Greenland with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world-chord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in eisiana waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in whose bacon at the neck at the neck for a 120 year old harshal tip, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on asparlor.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gives warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much bigger than in a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as early as possible," says the evolutionist biologist Scheuthanlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should be investing more in a long life on the other hand.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's call for Skinner raste last night in the Men's team in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the pivotal role that his Landmark Sir Chris Hoy had turned the legend as he made home to get a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England has claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">She reiterated the trick, after it was in March at the World Championships in London despite the setbacks Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hints.</seg>

<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they remained, when they saw potential in the carrots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy triumphs - and Skinner continued in the qualifying round a Olympic chord, but in the stills the New Zealand was victorious on the first lap.</seg>

<seg id="17">We have conquered a Olympiarekord in the Endrunde and defeated the world champion.</seg>

<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting shop around 10 percent of total electricity Victorias consumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting shop, which led last year to a closure of the Anglean power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting away from Alcoa in Portland loses money and is risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculations in regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australi dollar and last due to the electricity price of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which serves the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latin America, shared with it that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="18">AGL said that the value of the contracts is already written in its yearly quarter at the amount of $187 million in "expectation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "ability Alcoas... to operate the melting shop or to guarantee the power supply to the melting shop" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is yet another explanation as to why it has resigned from the treaty.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only used in our local communities and all over London, but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we already have 10,000 new apprentices, some 40,000 jobs to create new jobs and create an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement heaens is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to over-winds, but Heathrow answers every question to it.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in attractive growth and to leave a legacy to leave the airport as well as in the whole of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years as a result of the world's best airport terminal to T2, which was built in the midst of the two busiest catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third run tour, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's London games were a great success for Britain and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could be applied to similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow reation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably rejected more dry lands as de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and to be protected from more evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS modeling simmer exponates the slow renunciation of Venus its day-side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds creating something like an umbrella is working to parachute the surface from a majority of the sun warms.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought by Planetary Research.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of compressive malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists from Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies surveyed over the past twelve months were at least once, partly several victims of an attack with blackmailing software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of the companies were once the target of a ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly to the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators, in order to be able to use the embedded systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specialized their blackmailing-software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially-pressing ransom will considerably higher than for individuals.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of pollutants," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered creators for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she searches for unseen files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as for archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the blackmains.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final encoding code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptogenetic Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private use the personal photo database is at stake, it deals with companies to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls from when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German firms affected by ransomware, 13 percent had to cut business operations completely, in case they were people of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several times of victims were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims always: pays, it only enhances the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn knew that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the payable areas and contact with blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their sacrifices by chat on how they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access-to-access support websites, or decode for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if individuals are discarving after payments of a few hundred euro, companies must take part tough and five-digit sums have to pay for their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits out of the ransomware-blackmail the hacker becomes more professional and share the work, explains security-experts Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers are selling their contaminants in the form of a software construction.</seg>
<seg id="30">The pre-existing Malware kits were created by the malware even, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptable tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmains are then searching for more hackers in order to spread the freshly caught software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you can log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminal and instructs a further one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inactivated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry the spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies, who better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the company IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey can be trusted to repel Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators are instead occupied with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price levels," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus the damage-potential is higher than before the type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators might be able to take fully new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they were able to get a connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the bolting of such unobstructed heating could be really worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then instead of heating in the future an entire production road block in a factory, Ransomware might also be a theme in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday-proof</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will put up everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini-vans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the ond.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials inside the interior are well finished and act pleasant, only the cockpit-top is off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile vehicles are the HR-V storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 l with elevated and 1026 l in unfolded back pain, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical as it sounds like: the dorsal areas of the back bench can be lit up like Kinosessel and therefore offer storage space, which is height from the floor up to a height of 1.24 m.</seg>
<seg id="10">The suitcase is well loaded, however, the battery-height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1,6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide turnkey areas very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he is likely to do some quieter in his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption is of 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are another motorization: a 1.5-l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP.</seg>
<seg id="15">An Allwheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>

<seg id="19">For the safety systems belongs to the City of Notbremsassistent (works up to speed 32), the collisions-system and the spurary assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collisions are irridden sometimes because it evaluated many obstacles as "approaching objects" in the ranger.</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works in the remote-light assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temporal regulator reacts to the traffic detection and throttle when needed the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI-jack are under armrest and are therefore a bit awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who does not want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you are going around for everlasting, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is far from waking up to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult ingestion experience and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there may be many causes underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German society for sleeping research and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand during the time is the insomnie, that is a one-way or a sleeptive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that many people experience as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, leader in the German Haussmann association with practice in the Lower Saxony-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, mental or malicious factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not seldom that sleeping-disorder is an expression of a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is common especially for depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are working together.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a slipped disk can lie bad, wake all two to three hours and begins to greet about everyday problems and -worry, there is weaver an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who are not sleeping well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and that day is compromised, should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite differently: one is tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moodiness or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options occur among other things behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy or even medication - classical sleeping-coated tablets just in an emergency and maximum for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly hallow ones in Germany, stressed Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should consult with sleeping problems first at the home doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clear up with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to be in sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleeping laboratory - in case of snoring with respiratory disorders, in pathological daily-fatigue, at dormitory or if one does not find the cause of a sleeptive disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the study itself.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cabling, one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes on the body you carry a nozzle, a chest strap, and a antennae at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also draws a camera on the ceiling to the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can victims get a grip on?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions on which one can put a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is counting on: regular bedtime and rising times, not to sleep long in bed, do not sleep watching TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and look at night not at the clock - then you begin to reckon immediately, and that is totally and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which should soon be demolished, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new flats will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy neighborhood" as described in the relevant property company Friedrichshain, however, are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime the residents have rented contracts, on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning of the year, Henkel in Berlin had repeatedly called for a hard drive to the police against the project, the area as a "no-go-zone" for police officers and the 94 known as the starting point of an autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having given the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterdsmiths, with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks with official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three men's cars on site, unrestricted parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of the unidentified home owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and builders were driven by sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street acts peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others are talking prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main locality of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived in the Kiev since 1999 and Jana *, who here raised three children, are mainly attributable to the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share the concern of rising rents and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiev, who wish to repent in front of vandaliating left in front of vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, who captured the Berlin coursenator and the police between domestic occupied and their neighbors, does not seem so obvious.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was a traditional worker neighborhood, which also has a lower average of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home-ups and the resulting living projects have been occupied for a long time since 1990: in 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared together in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaean and are partly occupied by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become increasingly becoming magnets for tourists and ballberliner from around the world: with them the inhabitants of GDR-times and former domestic occupied their Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen since 2009 for about 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one realizes it to a slipped slices or freshly squeezed facades that have been tossed with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words of "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours might consider that as a problem, it could not necessarily be affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury, according to policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the criminal offences make kind charges, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is unimportant: people at 94 are their neighbours, they have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous flammers there are also no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga Street - and stayed there.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back down its road: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly interferes in the district of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants, like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by spotted new builds in former construction gaps, which suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"they are ultimately condominium, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well bewildered," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely not a healing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if one never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For zuiled, who like about colour bombed, Kerstin has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked to be called by their correct name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, it is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogics support the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all players: refugees, working child refugee, administration, authorities and who else is misleading.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the work circle indicates that volunteers are more than grateful that Deut now is there, the secret wool of wool, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked as much as on the multitude of wanting-areas outreble - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "looking for a administrative office with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work," "" "Ruholograms" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, working with the local people and also behind the scenes, as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot for three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehra- and full-time actors support.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon available in the washing machine</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the" "" "connectivity" "" "connection, which have been acknowledged." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to place the refugees in their own or rented residences.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations need to bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the European Security Council to the Commune and jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been quite difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">They did not work until now, while you are reliant on private apartments, as Deut.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-inflammatory apartments must be made, as it is so nice.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, soon new containers are soon set up in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm place, it is practicable, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and training courses for refugees and migrants that need to be up or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," said Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, do charitable work - and this motivates and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for communities leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity means not just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of revenge.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here we jump here management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time meaningful for them, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point have the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, do not be able to work and be useless, but will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But problem cases are there, says customers honestly, "people, at which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this has already been a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent incidents fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says quite clearly, "what some could call" What some naïve. "a restrisiko could and would not exclude it however.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the auxiliaries are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents also be subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in dismemberment.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main - and honorary volunteers are to be held on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Yet they always in the background that soon a new Stoß could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, do not shy away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher also claims to be sensible at the present time.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
