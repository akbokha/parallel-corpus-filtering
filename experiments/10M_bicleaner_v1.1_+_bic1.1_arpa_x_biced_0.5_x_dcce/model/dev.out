Obama welcomes Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teheran &apos;s destabil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
but in the wake of the meeting , it is also meant to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington was critic@@ ised the continuing settlement of Israel and acceler@@ ates a lack@@ lu@@ cent will in the peace process .
by the deal with the Obama &apos;s prof@@ ess deal to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two is further deterior@@ ated .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can party at the US Congress , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech , which was partially viewed as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the vote im@@ min@@ ent in Israel .
in an emergency , Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon was born with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police , having shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; however still lives and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a hand@@ written not@@ ch who wanted to put down a white block : &quot; I am sorry I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he was provided in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was shot and killed at the door of the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door of his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ cies da Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that he was then made a fatal emergency call at some time .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police star@@ ch him .
a day after the shooting at the University , which students and faculty means to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what is being created .
the details presented by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him were told , helped a picture by a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were interested in his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , he did not have a history of violence or criminal pre @-@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt herself mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both set up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher embr@@ aces 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some dis@@ likes and problem behavi@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers that he praised , said he seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do at the end of academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University for a test of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in that year he provided only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policies of the University mean that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
universal President William La@@ ha@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something at Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
these are questions which cannot be answered .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as imports .
before he was arrested , he was killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oz@@ meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he represented his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 people and created Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received the spring in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs drew him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
back at that time he was the woman &apos;s sh@@ al .
all the girls were mol@@ ded when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ce were obviously together some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the letter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you had a dog named Light@@ ning which lived with them in the baked house , which borders on a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ce , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , told they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends had stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met him , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues .
he &apos;s represented Pr@@ enti@@ ce when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago both on a summer @-@ year market .
later they played together one or two gig later .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ce was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes conversation @-@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar close to the Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ stry Night in the night 5th September last time , after he finished his guitar and mou@@ sta@@ w@@ ry stops in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were in the rooms and they were talking with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , led the first semester program and specialized on American ab@@ orig@@ ines and colonial history , &quot; said Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Stu@@ dents .
on Tuesday evening campus in Cleveland participated in the Tuesday night about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , associates , students and members of the community in a candle lit commem@@ oration service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated also at the Mah@@ n@@ Guard while the university ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that he had shot the emergency , and that Lamb treated in his emergency Pr@@ enti@@ ce while his wife did , but there is no indication that the two had ever married .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .

UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon , says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen from violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the General Meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Council make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to address the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity that they proved with Iran in achieving a nuclear de@@ pot .
8 cont@@ en@@ ite values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious about .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have shown him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in Surv@@ eys , it has ( still ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no claim that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that during this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , who did not even win a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external side groups like anybody Bush &apos;s Bush Empire Sover@@ eign and the conservative Economic System Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps through@@ s and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values which suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps and populations have turned over 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by the middle of July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa has noticed that 60 % of re@@ public@@ ans have a good idea of p@@ umping .
two third of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy to be happy with Tr@@ ump than candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of re@@ public@@ ans said , they would be either &quot; loved &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the cont@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son produces about the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 per cent , which would say the same via Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; mad &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be a candidate .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans looks not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump ref@@ uses for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of re@@ public@@ ans think it has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se to the White House , ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put up their nest @-@ be@@ ware , can hold republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if asked , who most likely won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet .
that &apos;s a change at the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this stage in the last cycle , four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans expressed that Rick Per@@ ry compared the nom@@ ination compared with only 28 % for the final candidate co @-@ Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters are seen as plau@@ sible .
even when the Republi@@ can gathered around a Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everybody .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to the l@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is spread over a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will support health support .
he before C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans suggests that they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday indicates that only a little more than half of the voters support the b@@ ump will say they have set their voices .
of course , it can happen a lot to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps sharp@@ est competition in the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are united with p@@ umping on the subject of immigration .
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was devoted to two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration of the immigration lies in public discourse with 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic excav@@ ation of Tr@@ ump crucial Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and re@@ damage the re@@ development efforts .
but , after the new ABC / Post survey about Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as migration remains in the spotlight , it will also do Donald Tr@@ ump too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son falls about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider &apos;s status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider rather than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa ahead 2 weeks shows that three of four I@@ owa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , 54 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive properties of Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive housing complex - with a view across the North Sea watt .
the street costs a square meter of a roof @-@ roof in the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt the range of objects is restricted by nature , meaning that it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special clim@@ ates costs one square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top position , one of the price of pe@@ anu@@ ts comes to one of the price of pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate service angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square meter in di@@ zz@@ ying tre@@ ble .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dreams starts thanks to Müller and i@@ dol
doubt Tor@@ bat in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky winner of Thomas Müller @-@ paved the FC Bayern leads the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sou@@ theastern start of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ tz@@ e have taken a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan in the &quot; mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her shot game in the Champions League at the Greek record Grand S@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the Mü@@ llers twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90 . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th victory result in Serie is supposed to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take over the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received at its 28 February in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who had made a mere la@@ yo@@ ke thought of the idea of the world .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate , &quot; had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ pac@@ k@@ aki &apos;s sta@@ dion in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich stopped .
they showed a concentrated and engaged concept , without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pir@@ aus had won his recent six home games in the Royal Class , including against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ ten@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 we also proud Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , into seven European ac@@ ar du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bold , with their offensive efforts , but often too influential in works .
the attacks were developed too often by playing time on the left side of the Costa Brava , which rarely came through the former Braunschweig Council of Omar El@@ ab@@ ou@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller served by the right more fortunate than he suggested his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper hill .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
initially , as a Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms , Brown the head@@ ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct delivery , the Tor@@ s@@ Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern was used to it from dominant game , it was possible to set Piraeus N@@ adel@@ stick .
on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was also Lost .
just like he was a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New he allowed to defend Gu@@ ardi@@ ola with David Al@@ aba in the centre alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , according to muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside .
the World Cup hero was given a green light after the final training , said sports@@ vor@@ ie Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; anyone wanting something different from it is already mal@@ ignant . &quot;
even during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the attached Leah ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ feet , Müller made a marked .
in front of the game it was at the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ all come .
after a smaller group of partly clou@@ ded Bayern fans in their audience @-@ bloc apparently the pend@@ ant with words and gestures had prov@@ oked , the security forces went and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , shame not only of the lungs , but also the teeth - that lays close a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : res@@ igns its risk fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely was higher enough to weigh the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ ,000 participants .
major causes for tooth decay were c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ums , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of loss may therefore go back to frequent tooth te@@ fl@@ akes with smokers .
not clear , to what extent smoking has also increased the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could reduce their risk now within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the dangers are back to the level of non @-@ holes , explained The du@@ sty Thomas Diet@@ rich spoke of the English University of Birmingham .
people must convince people to be non @-@ smo@@ ker , stated teacher manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime of life . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our knowledge , also leads to a good dental c@@ anti@@ le to the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 have been affected by in@@ tim@@ eless@@ ness , but DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already been pointed out that smoking will increase the risk of early tooth exp@@ ir@@ ages .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ score the findings .

European Commission in battle on TTIP new court proposes a new court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to improve the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its function corresponds significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the St@@ one@@ is presented to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position to the US &apos;s free @-@ trade talks .
the German government announced the support of the German government .
TTIP must develop the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade area with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbitration panel are in concrete terms that EU states and the US choose to select independent judges for a new type of investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to come to equal parts of the EU , the US and third countries .
it is for the first time that is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments objection .
up to so far the procedures involved will not deal with themselves as a refer@@ ee , an objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and fairness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long run , they want to work on a International Investment Court in the long run .
there , for example , there may also be a dispute between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbitration ( IS@@ DS ) above all are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ lob@@ es debut in the leader of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ bi@@ &apos;s debut is anticip@@ ating the leader of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and to create for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n will be able to take home the first of his six current questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance from the media is likely to be tried and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he has also said that he can skip a few sessions to leave her colleagues too .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ on &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow kab@@ in@@ et@@ ts and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party took provo@@ king on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them in a commemor@@ ative ceremony to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ isms by a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the center of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by &apos;s decision not to sing the national @-@ hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; respectful &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he dealt with the Labour leader , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ te@@ &apos;s national team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parliam@@ entary Party was appointed him as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also for@@ k@@ lift within the Labour Party , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ no statements about the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that the changes put forward to remove the whole idea of a whole limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work@@ ings and pensions Minister expressed that the party &quot; is very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans , to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ !
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth place leader David Cameron , since then he has T@@ ory chief , since he has been across the dispute over the disp@@ atch box in parliament last decade .
the Labour president , who promised another policy approach , says he &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions addressed to Mr. Cameron has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the prime minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is confron@@ t@@ atively and that he has made both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stri@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and fighting with resistance and instead made himself focused on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , which is represented by the shadow of economics , if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues will occasionally take the word and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the farmhouse , addressed to debate the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron spoke to remove himself from politics in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the leader of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he adm@@ its that he has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she was first sent in television first in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer for his leadership in the House and his position in the House of House and his position among his parliament@@ arians , though critics have argued , they become a caricature and have a far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound growth through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was spr@@ ink@@ le @-@ like following data that will display a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was increased 100 due to the IC@@ BM@@ iller &apos; goal .
between May and July the results grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom for 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage has been the fastest growing rate since 2009 and expressed interest at the time of interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 44@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offering of the Rival AB participated .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ kes , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ pi@@ d .
Bur@@ berry shares were looking for encouraging messages from the competition @-@ group for luxury equipment judge 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures propose to all expectations and showed also that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth again .
ship@@ ments of Glen@@ core came by 5 % after the strongh@@ old said that he took 2.5 billion dollars from a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt loss .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI , were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decrease of 4.@@ 3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s has set up its rating for the company ratings .
J@@ D Sports has increased by 3.@@ 1 % after the management of the Sport@@ sp@@ urs company had signed a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million in the first half .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages may endan@@ ger the expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher wages for UK workers could mean more sal@@ es@@ ight in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchase is the higher labour @-@ powers at his company , he says .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; .
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ y sits on the cold stone plates at the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber construction : here lives her I@@ dol , whose poster is hanging at St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday night .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as their mom E@@ wa deserves in half a year .

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings together the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er @-@ Ide@@ a
potatoes or don@@ ors ?
it goes both - and while in the potato en@@ closures , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ ors Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of don@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster at the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea led him to the idea of a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; potatoes instead of don@@ er &quot; that he happened to be on television .
since then a barbecue is rotating in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has now to be bought at the Patent Office in Munich since the Patent Office .
therein it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes are the mirror of the mirror , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y it .
only as much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he says .
culinary nations also arrive well with its customers .
met@@ adata starts under the ground level of jurisdiction to combat al@@ - inser@@ tion
met@@ gi@@ l tries to protect the Ig@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ als has launched a ground@@ water campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di opened the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ als and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets are expanding their relationships with local food suppliers and build the Ig@@ A brand by mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Eis@@ hof S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough when distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop@@ keepers which sell from the South Australian football meetings to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ als also published further details of his defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers carry through their annual investors , alcohol and equipment .
it is high on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ der can account and higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ Network in the Eastern states .
in South Australia and Western Australia , Ar@@ an@@ isch Provin@@ cial and Ig@@ A Ret@@ ails have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di twelve percent of the food market will take away around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take all available actors , but primarily independent retailers .
a report published in this week according to the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer could lose 360 million sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million from the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the acceptance that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , and generates sales of 500 million $ and € 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business , and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s high Fi@@ x@@ cost basis , Met@@ als could cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ ac market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ shopping are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley acknow@@ le@@ dges that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s turnover in food and food business grew by 3.@@ 7 percent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , participated in conducting a business in Melbourne that Met@@ als likely will disappear within a decade .
met@@ gi@@ ers refused to respond to the comment of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ z has contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As Market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and grocery stores , which is roughly 1,@@ 200 per cent in 2012 , reflecting its operational debt reduction in high @-@ scale pressure on sales and margins .
a wholes@@ aler , however , we@@ ds and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to grow sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ ding &apos;s worth in hundreds of products every week and supply their stores with faster growing fresh foods and provide a better range of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and load recovery programs will be pointed out and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ aki is supported by the President of the Australian tennis tournament Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ aki deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ in@@ akis was one of the &quot; color@@ full damage &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Leu@@ gios and deserves to the President of the Australian tennis feder@@ ations Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ à , the younger owner of the talented Du@@ os , which is always described as a &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; which is famous for the in@@ famous debate by Kyr@@ gios St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ aki and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee while Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have destroyed Kyr@@ gios . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ote a tennis rac@@ quet after a cr@@ amp@@ ant failed to ver@@ ge a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ aki defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , for the second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing , about which I contempl@@ ated me , is the fact that after my mind Than@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a bat , when he lost due to a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has vom@@ ited a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severe .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on he has never respected a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is well trained in shape , he is a very sturdy and well @-@ engineered young guy and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into consideration the decision to arrange for the important pre@@ decision which starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common choice &quot; as the right for all but it secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term regular part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all of the controversy surrounding &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick was very quick to climb up what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . it desc@@ ends into the eyes of the public and he deserves some bad mistakes and he deserves to assist him . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it adequate and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and locked the border south@@ bound with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all the fes@@ tivities to try illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed on the border , as hundreds of migrants were killed in a no @-@ man &apos;s land , and who were re@@ acting with ou@@ trage .
the people who had fled from violence to an unknown period in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents , and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations have gone up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter about them sh@@ web@@ te , sk@@ an@@ ed the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ dly ins@@ ults against the Hungarian immigration policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister , it is &quot; unacceptable , &quot; that migrants from Hungary would have returned to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a micro@@ lateral .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries over the next few days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turmoil in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a disputed meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed upon .
however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who re @-@ contracted out Italy and Greece . they op@@ pressive their hopes that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would achieve that the EU countries would include another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a close action between Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities more competences to cope with the crisis so they could speed up roads and asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also envis@@ aged the construction of a thorn @-@ wire stri@@ c along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after it has ended a fence on the Ser@@ b border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were forced on the betting to create the bar@@ k wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has been for many military refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks and entry point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban succeeded , however , that most of the im@@ pending economic migrants are seeking protection in search of a better life , and non @-@ war migrants , who are strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that occurred around midnight in Hungary in force , make crossing the border or the sh@@ red@@ dish of 4 @-@ meters ( 13 feet ) high za@@ uns , which the government set along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher offen@@ ders for condemned human dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation emerged as the Hungarian government , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said governmental speaker at K@@ ov@@ ac Re@@ por@@ tees in the southern City Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , who is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have previously visited the border of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come by distr@@ acting the fence , they are now into custody and are accused of comp@@ uted by criminal acts according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven fron@@ tier crossing with Serbia , after a train@@ ee with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders , had arrived .
chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and op@@ press a crowd to go down there .
about 20 failed to get into , but thousands left outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s edge before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit head start in the democratic race for nom@@ ination on the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the floor .
Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters with pro @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet prom@@ ul@@ ted whether he would go for the Office Office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is strong , which candidates will assist them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ ically supporters are more vulnerable in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had posted some profits .
Clinton continues a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have reduced .
your support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back at 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 50 years ago has made a hurry , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Clinton has a big lead in the older voters .
last month Clinton had been a two @-@ digit head start with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections held nationwide , they would say that they would support Clinton as the party was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions , and further 15 percent would support them only because they nomin@@ ee the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ically &apos;s current supporters can especially be thrilled with it in particular .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter they would like to support it .
while 48 percent of democratic voters want to say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters do this about their peak can@@ di@@ ties Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) .
when Clin@@ ics are questioning in an open question why they want them to be the nomin@@ ee is the most frequent answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ ics , this project is also mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and constitu@@ encies are also cited .
since the Vice President re@@ jects a potential for the presidential election , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
by Clin@@ ics followers , they say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
by matching bi@@ ds not to run for the Democrats &apos;s nom@@ ination , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead raised to S@@ ander , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win elections ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic elec@@ torate call questions about their constitu@@ encies .
similarly as last month there is no only democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters of the pro @-@ elections as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential applicants are able to show good results in some important characteristic of voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities ensure Clinton , S@@ ander and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong man@@ qualities .
bi@@ den cuts in among the three candidates best starting in honesty , while Clin@@ ically &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic voters of the election have in general also Clinton , S@@ ander and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in alignment with their views .
with all these measurements there was about a quarter of democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions to Hill@@ ary Clinton to be continued to use a personal e @-@ mail address and one server during its term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not influenced their opinions on a whole .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion occurred in March , shortly after the problem came out of the light .
most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion was still worse .
it is mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for it under registered voters : 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the eligible voters do not consider it to be honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the gender equality are not far from honest and un@@ trustworthy as well .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes in leadership .
out of the six tested Candi@@ dates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty .
a majority looks rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters with the pro @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving close to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the newest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the elec@@ torate at the new survey will now fall dramatically in the new survey , and others fall dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters support country @-@ wide further law@@ suit in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted at the Fox News debate last month in order to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fo@@ b in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received from demo@@ graph@@ ical groups and passes p@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ sich , is struck with Wis@@ fir@@ s Governor Scott Walker , which is deepest on the deepest , and although from 10 % support this month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in third place .
the fault @-@ mar@@ ital at the sample sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was done in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - it lands at 19 % support for re@@ public@@ ans , behind the p@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump clearly in front of Car@@ son .
with a view over a last week rising Car@@ son a p@@ ump found some side dogs for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed to question the l@@ umps of faith .

pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if essential values can only be measured in the distance , sufficient for swi@@ ur@@ kers already a trip to the Mediterranean , to find even the warm water .
a bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure in a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the north and the Baltic Sea has in this week , shares the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , swimming temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood ran@@ ged with the death of a bar@@ fer college .
nearly two years , after a student during a schi@@ av@@ arian ritual , a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder will be filed against five people .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Schrot@@ t @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory session in September 2013 , and delayed its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared with it .
officials said , he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and has been attacked while he was trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally def@@ endant on headaches , then he fell to mind .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta PSI @-@ Brotherhood not prov@@ oked the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g impot@@ ent and supposedly waited an hour before they carried him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood , to obtain advice , said Poli@@ nat@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and created the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood as a matter of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mation ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his wounds .
after an automatic report , Den@@ g has been repeatedly joined with dum@@ b power injuries by head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the gun bro@@ ws of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies from 1970 every year on the gun , &quot; Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represent , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held to account and this step from authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury upon Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended one charge because of the third counts for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for sheer ons@@ lau@@ ght and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to hold the persons involved , but if there is an organization which has - officially or un@@ officially - this has been sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold those accountable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood is vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a raise will come and the house will fall into bed@@ bugs , ren@@ dez@@ vous plans for bonds will rise and the economy will push into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small instructions on how to proceed .
a recession came from only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in doing how the economy and the financial investments react .
hence representatives of the US bank have stressed so strong that investors should not concentrate on when they start raising interest rates , but rather on the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
in the end , market participants could see , however , that the entire excitement was possibly exaggerated because of a rate of interest .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ vali@@ kon@@ om in Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to se@@ cul@@ l the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is one of the most historical trends @-@ based view on how some areas of business might be able to react to :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate fluctu@@ ations can be more volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to gain investments from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps shows the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a recent study subject to what interest acc@@ uses from the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 per cent - on the way to Zin@@ c percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with average yield in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , head system strateg@@ ist published at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the German bank said that the effects on stock tend to arise later in the cre@@ ment cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but of interest @-@ ca@@ vities , they often promote it .
in the current case the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that could not exist before and accelerate a recession .
the extremely noteworthy is that gross Dom@@ estic Product will be at the lowest point near its lowest point with a rate of interest .
according to Deutsche Bank , the largest rate of interest in 16@@ 1 was twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3,@@ 6 percent , only few expect that will last and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zin@@ c ca@@ vities at a so fragile economic setting could be risky and throwing the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have prepared the whole year for a rate of interest and all eyes were directed towards the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strains and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could implement an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the increases @-@ cycles of 1950 to date were taken place at a super cycle with increasing momentum during the contrac@@ tion and on @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly made after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; the report says .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow revival of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the firm income was also volati@@ le , as the market increases a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effects of bonds are more quickly than those of shares , if they change their strategic course .
with bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction once the first increase / lowering took place in the cycle .
at the end of the Ear@@ th@@ age cycle , the ship@@ ments rate dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates result in that ren@@ ders are closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ atter of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ bonds mature often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interesting , Jones doesn &apos;t mean that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield time is fl@@ atter , credit has increased and volati@@ lity is increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed is exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in large and full companies , companies that engage the greater part of their business in the United States , benefit from interest rates and local produce more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; Quality - &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the clients .
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a low balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares met their counterparts with low quality in each 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ Company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also profit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spar@@ man could see gains from higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says leader in Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dec@@ ision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ tainment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial rivals .
he also cited out the BBC Music Awards and said that she has just im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its .
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grip the show The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , which is a leader member and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , proving that he does something of doing what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal Radi@@ os@@ tic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prop@@ agate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also took note of the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , The Br@@ its seems to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually just im@@ itate them , which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Direc@@ torate @-@ General dis@@ missed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and public awareness .
what I get from Radio 3 I &apos;m going to do this musi@@ cally different musi@@ cally different .
and there is a commitment to live music and music which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , find new music and give new works to order , I consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that it must be harder to get involved , as it did in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music .
but radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing held in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for doing among fires , the commercial rivals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs of € 22 million .
take a look at why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that the company will find a hit in our own barn , &quot; if the next time there is a series of entertainment .
however , he ref@@ uses to exclude the order of other series of The Voice in the future or to give money from the prescription options for other maintenance formats .
net sales rose in August at the slower and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest results since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased mainly three years due to the use of mobile phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the expense in November
for more than a decade the virtual one has dri@@ lled , and many of the major shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online sales begin to stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the overall expendi@@ tures for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales begin to stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the early years and go back to 2000 , this has become more and more developed over time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editors of the IM@@ R@@ G sales follow the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales were increased to three years ago , as a buyer started to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shopping online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ utes to be one , and we will possibly experience that growth reduces .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is quoted as a reason for the after@@ math .
experts believe that buyers have their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers @-@ sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the shop@@ pers fought for the bar@@ gain , buyers could prevent from doing sh@@ opp@@ ings .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was a result of 5 £ spending a bit more than 1 £ / £ / EUR .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the bar @-@ cities .
Muslims living in Mecca while the crane &apos;s accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first gra@@ ves of Mecca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden .
the Ministry of Health said that in total 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones who were killed , than a crane to Me@@ k@@ kas Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ n filled , mostly in white dressed , the track , to declare their respect , than the first of the dead ended their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m cemetery .
the funeral proc@@ ession went to the Holy Sites , where only days previously made a tree crown through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collap@@ sed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial , as the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden because of the disaster that led even 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction was caused .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 Be@@ es who were killed than a crane replaced by the Great Central mosque Me@@ k@@ kas were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was plung@@ ed .
Mr Ak@@ ram has been at the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi officers already have said that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mecca , with the thousands who will continue to come to the city , will continue .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden @-@ Laden might not have stopped the arm of the sick , when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin @-@ Laden group would be responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail not , but said that the management of the company &apos;s foreign travel must be banned .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man dis@@ missed , which caused the overthrow of the crane , which plung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims occur in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later takes place later this month .
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group has no statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decree also critici@@ zed the group because of not current security measures and because they did not co @-@ operate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of Kr@@ ing@@ es surrounded Me@@ k@@ kas Grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction , that is led by the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group .
the Bin Laden has been linked with the mist@@ ress family since decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the late leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a lo@@ fty son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in the 1990 @-@ 90s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before an arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials to pay that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the dead are to be paid and the same amount of permanent injured .
others receive the half of that amount .
B &amp; Q boss tells that the time of cheap European craftsmen are reserved
British employ more and more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe increased behind
that leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close in nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that British will place their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes .
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for the to@@ wering of walls , you do not seem to be a minority .
because Britain is taking an increasing number of arti@@ sans in order to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building @-@ markets chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offer services to deep @-@ prices may now be outdated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops is planning to open up to Cra@@ fts@@ men and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions on the shop are met by women .
at the moment the men were ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ed with the men .
she said it was necessary to place the growing demographic trends that had more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this more into a balance .
in principle , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of the choices based on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index exec@@ uting a leading company , has also instructed the top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupied already 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial leadership .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it wasn &apos;t difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ fis@@ her report a drop in the half @-@ year gain and the cul@@ ts after the group got the costs of the closing of the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .

regarding the re@@ pro@@ ach of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity the defence meant that the association was at no time ar@@ isen with an asset .
the sports function@@ aries could have been calculated only for repar@@ ations and for the club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and they had a lot of time and money to deri@@ ve from debt - the min@@ de@@ va contributed in the year 2001 about 600@@ ,000 in@@ billing ( about 4,000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we were standing in front of the situation : do we lead the club further or lock us up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ ut@@ f Grand @-@ General of the Financial Industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have mis@@ led money , that lost our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in terms of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there may only be no debt .
Fu@@ ther@@ more - in case of the financial - success the payout of the allowance for retro@@ sp@@ aci@@ ations made retro@@ sp@@ ectively rep@@ lic@@ ated until 1991 .
therefore , one had to pay a part of the allowance for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was depos@@ ited on the account .
therefore also l@@ ump and not detailed calculations , were explained by the former Ob@@ mann procedures .
the accounts and austerity dict@@ ations were the two def@@ endants in common , told the second def@@ endants .
why the payments to the club were not detailed in detail , the judges asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial investment , it was important only for debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association in 2011 .
these were declined , said the accused .
this securities account ran out on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not familiar according to the club &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge .
on that the prayer had no answer for a long time .
then he said he did believe that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the accused has been notified , justi@@ fying the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this bank was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why contam@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ endant pleaded not to this statement , because the association had never emerged as damage to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do , if the attorney says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom are you all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , he said the function@@ ary he never referred to a c@@ ents content , he only comp@@ uted kilometer som and diets .
at Di@@ et he made the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort would have been much higher , he added .
precise documents for the early years could not identify the def@@ endants .
these were after a business check , in which everything was judged correctly and were no longer maintained , explained them .
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second indic@@ tee .
all the Beh@@ ind might be in cash , in addition he must travel from his residence of international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard receives more 30,000 jobs
in addition to for three years of ongoing flow of personnel , the computer sector will reduce further jobs during the break @-@ up of the company .
the Stell@@ a@@ ways in the US computer program He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans for the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 spots in its corporate clients .
that should save costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a tax load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be accounted for in the fourth quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been concluded since three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP dealt with around 30@@ 2,000 people at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 .
complete performance gave the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share 2.4 percent after .
the company &apos;s large @-@ defined group from the Califor@@ nian Palo Alto , which is currently focused on : that is how the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new society this year - separate from the future @-@ oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be noted on the stock market .
another disappointing PC paragraph and a weaker demand for corporate clients in accordance with its services continue the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer based on Len@@ ovo .
in the third quarter at the end of July the sales of PC and printers increased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion .
proceeds in 15 out of 16 quarters were related .
HP answered with a split and massive pro@@ found@@ ings on the change in the industry .
the 76 years old company under the command of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late to realize that customers are buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more stores online .
Whit@@ mans re@@ frac@@ turing plans represent the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs in total .

24 percent , on the contrary , are to intervene in the conflict .
in doing so , a cooperation with Syrian leaders Bashar al @-@ Assad are 51 percent of respondents , 20 percent would be .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of violence against ser@@ b@@ ish @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed refugees on the Serbian border in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ front against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence of violence at the border inspection point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind had a police line forming and behind the polic@@ emen was a buff@@ alo .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing rocks , sticks and plastic bottles after the officials .
the officials first took a pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ ar@@ eng@@ a .
much drow@@ ning was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now deserted a somewhat longer .
a pregnant and evi@@ dently betrayed woman was carried away from the zone .

other refugees stuck together and suffered under respiratory problems .
also the press secretary of the police police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ mal and pepper spray .
time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. emergency bank
the world is observed , when the U.S. emergency bank come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade or not interest rates are raised .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , which was still last week &apos;s view , that F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will still persist a little longer and keep the interest rates on the present state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank could start the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less liquid outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good .
the decision to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
Queen of Death at the Delta State University behind exc@@ uses exc@@ uses
after the shooting and the killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later he was his colleague and killed him - Sh@@ annon was a note to say he was &quot; sorry &quot; during the first murder and wanted to &quot; he can do it un@@ done , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he is professor of geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and said , he was killed and someone killed .
he &apos;s represented by the staff of the not@@ ing that the police must send their police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house was , but &quot; no one will dis@@ rupt , &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
he gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am sorry I wanted it to make it und@@ o .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the Record , he was scre@@ ened up 300 miles from the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday night , when poli@@ cem@@ an him killed .
universal President William La@@ ha@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something at Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday which he said to believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ce had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; tr@@ al relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ce was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago but were friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ce had a daughter who is 19 and they were &quot; destroyed in the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ce her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ce worked online from home , according to statement from L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ce .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ce , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met for about three years with represented .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers came to pick him up at Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later at night , he was driving his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
he &apos;s represented in spring 2015 by the Delta State University in a doctoral title , according to his biography in the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
half a billion euros per year will save the Lufthansa &apos;s Lufthansa with a better organization .
150 of the world around 1,000 executives will cost the Group restructuring .
with the pilot &apos;s union , there are in@@ doors of new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and strengthens the low @-@ amount of Euro wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to some 500 million euros a year of cost and revenue syner@@ ge@@ tic , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a member of the Lufthansa for the passenger business .
the Billi@@ e gli@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the pre @-@ board team leader Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be in charge of Charles Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for the wings held in future .
the new activation highlights Spo@@ hr highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings which will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet at the future .
up to now the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
flying under the umbrella of the airline Air@@ line Group , represents three quarters of yearly sales of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot group cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) , the negotiations should be started again after the straigh@@ tening strike on this Thursday .
this shared the trade union .
the theme of the discussions should be the right @-@ standard for pilots .
cock@@ pit wanted to come to a year with a predicted record . &quot; as soon as possible to viable results .
the conflict between trade union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the spar@@ concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it appears that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors on the group &apos;s own endor@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ wings are left out .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play monthly th@@ ang due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
while this brought the left margin of outer body to tears and exp@@ end it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not giving hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had been in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before it was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double label and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will move tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen masculine .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will take six months and it won &apos;t be playing in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red map and the suspension of a mo@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola O@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , the arbit@@ er , did not pen@@ alize the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had been mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red map were required .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related in : Manchester United employ the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat in the PS@@ V
with the European Championship , the England @-@ defen@@ ders has an additional incentive to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very heavy because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you listen then that it is a very bad violation , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron gave The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost completely .
unless you are , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , he was asked to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who were published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , &quot; wrote Cameron in a message on the company of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I &apos;d like to read my children , as there seems to be always an image or message which we have never missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly described the act of the book , returns a content release of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , wins the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , who reads her wish . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspici@@ ously enough : the text by Cameron presented , partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax Film who is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems impro@@ bable that Cameron is the act of the book so little familiar . here comes an un@@ tit@@ uted boy , like the local environment through the bri@@ des Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ arding , sn@@ ak@@ age @-@ like beings , &quot; which is referred to in the name of the trees , &quot;
possibly such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text probably had come from Camer@@ au &apos;s Ele@@ ven office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the expul@@ sion from England , but it is still difficult
to po@@ ke Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when considering the Ka@@ der , the UK has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series is not on my card .
I would not stop an escap@@ ing victory .
A@@ last@@ y C@@ ooks page is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the collective spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
the ball develops Mor@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size upon test level , is an option for the attack .
in this case , Adam Ly@@ th is reti@@ res from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course be difficult for me as his chef in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ker is targeted at results .
there have been no frac@@ tional sign with Joe R@@ oot for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , because - and I said to this - players have their own best selection .
a long time ago it had been extended over the course of Ly@@ th , but he was in control of his own fate .
if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes from .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ am@@ iss and praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances and that surprises me not ; he is mainly a team man .
the question of how much time a test @-@ man receives in order to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son received before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England first saw Jonathan Des@@ p@@ t in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in peak , but this lost opportunity now is in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a stroke man that I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ker , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he had reached 2@@ 36 against us on a tr@@ ent Bridge which hit us very much .
he must receive at least the same chances as the before him , but this depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would perform an extra @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and receive four qu@@ icks too , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a le@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and that left @-@ handed has already shown that it is a vi@@ cious cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played out his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined as Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has taken three hundred rats immediately and are not looking back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ re of back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited work with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see themselves his statistics - average 31 with the club and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup chips that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela B@@ awar@@ ding , B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , because he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit from .
sometimes , new voices can be added to the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in accordance with the previous person .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be deployed at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ actors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with players depend their jobs from the results .
such decisions are made not easy to heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit UK from the EU ) could be lu@@ ded to Zul@@ u when the economy is moving into a fax machine by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ willingness to keep Britain in the EU will face more deeply into trouble with each passing day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who suffered violent implications for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ bi@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at called a European diplom@@ at and said recently that some member states , such deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , such as the EU is now and did not always get out of own debt , Britain itself , an agenda associated with sag@@ ging concessions and disturbing symptoms which they mostly don &apos;t want to be sati@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Brighton , the TU@@ C &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting on her Annual General Meeting that it may not like to endan@@ ger social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbing for summit or bilateral meetings at foreign capitals , make a photo of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to look out in the inside of the EU tent in the inside of the EU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can be seen that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s careful chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a fo@@ al , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has been done for the exaggerated long dur@@ ations like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or substitution in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ at@@ ant force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist political government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that she will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent the Australia &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even therefore obviously not provide helpful remarks , completely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , throughout Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ dum@@ b surgery to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process but susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , as they did during the period of Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired refer@@ endu@@ ms in 1975 but not , which supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ ists who has made a name for themselves as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his im@@ it@@ eness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .

actually , Tony Blair said to think about her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of spending at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ kan@@ ians than Blair , when he dis@@ held Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Blair had rejected the principle of the adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it for a back@@ door .

it may take , but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ seat he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
now most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blue @-@ fuel trend and the wil@@ dered mer@@ ging of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ British can probably say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week told when the boy@@ sc@@ outs in it strug@@ gled , does not admit that Cor@@ &apos;s appointment was the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as the shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years when his old father turned on TV in order to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was still more attractive .
but to fight &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C said to his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on the Monday night .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ bi@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV about the clock and above all in the whirlpool of the social media , a breeding centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right , Cameron not to give a free card for Europe who permits it to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ral surgery for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is sure that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambiguous spectrum - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ faction economic , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no more just a question of esot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats must be obligated to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin do not waste any political capital - they have susp@@ icious voters - to make concessions to the British if it can be anything meaning@@ less ?
the US has already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , to which I was reminded at the start on Monday by something that was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
expert criticism : report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly associated with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) they joined The Lanc@@ et by announ@@ cing the criticism used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; Basic Re@@ report &quot; in the past month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial included in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily y basis , &quot; on which he formed his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expected that the cont@@ en@@ tion is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of follow @-@ up and modeling .
indeed , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to create a model for multi @-@ profit criteria ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damages of various nicotine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also subscri@@ bes to the testimonials of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette maker , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International he added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the body are not delivered , but these include several known E @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify a range of industries in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco charge of p@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tough evidence of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions in the p@@ he report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes were as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of health and wellbeing at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J were already re@@ acted earlier .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at its addiction .
all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low , but that we continue to have long term effects to study .
p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is eviden@@ ced and what , above all , if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0.000 people annually die from an illness with regards to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion pounds per year .
by making clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give East@@ l@@ ders the former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly viewed by a smaller public , which is likely to be seen by a smaller public , as much as controversial time windows to place the most popular shows of their rivals and sen@@ ders as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had tried out with channel 4 for six years with channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would give or sends that the BBC programs would be shown on behalf of not sub@@ jug@@ ated rivals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I think for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least give its production on programs that others do not make or on order .
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because you want to achieve as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is of course nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , admittedly both show @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I chose to see myself how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame for reviews is &quot; due to the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term assistance . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows by the BBC ship this again , which was the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law @-@ programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they meet their duties and they can argue if they &apos;re looking at their search@@ ical missions to justify 4 billion £ Broadcasting , &quot; Well , we have all of these ob@@ scure programs created which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which nobody ever wanted to see .
for broad@@ casting , Johnson said the board : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ hap@@ ing system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course , you all think that for 150 £ per year , one gets a great value here , but for those people who for the 150 £ is a lot of money , ask myself whether this is true , because it does not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday she urged the BBC to review and entertain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that little from the BBC @-@ production would now be classified as formation - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,@@ 1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the public tel@@ ev@@ isions in Australia and Canada .
regarding the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , he said only a handful of TV can be shown to make all online available online .
&quot; Miscellaneous &quot; can be brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with Klang@@ impul@@ sen .
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with genetically modified organisms , that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment they are using sound impulses , which can be heard for the human hearing and high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses go through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels which respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ Get , with the ultras@@ ound image to be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ bren@@ ica Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day will replace the depths of the depths of the brain , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease symptoms .
gro@@ c@@ ms normally do not respond to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ul@@ tran@@ ts work on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als can be called and found in the membran@@ es of some of the throws cells .
the sound waves are the opening of these I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als and enable the cells to be associated with such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , changed Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ onic s TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als carry .
when he uses ultras@@ ound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ ans and in the wor@@ ms where they turn the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ Sizegenetics , a tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing tool , which allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can be un@@ hin@@ dered and so can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that using geni@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the accumulated human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for the life of students
eleven years ago I went to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who he@@ als me - and to the numerous , long @-@ minded complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the train in a student residence is from easily nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely sho@@ cking .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie , people tell you wh@@ ence you are coming , whether and where you have Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you are in terms of Cor@@ bi@@ n and why you can honestly hate Mar@@ m@@ ite or hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ extra@@ kt Ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your lashes would rent in fire and extingu@@ ishers .
allow people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , movie night locations and municipal venue , but they are also places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
related : do not remember to begin the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted received a crude treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many school residen@@ ces are a space @-@ to @-@ room stroll @-@ culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go further , but you have to go away so I have gone back the energy that I consumed things for inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
try to sense when a class@@ mate is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it a text message instead of knock .
apro@@ pos cr@@ aps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the peak of back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of men is imag@@ ining himself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have to smile . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships close .
your fellow @-@ dwell@@ ers feel obliged to entertain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
mis@@ mixed c@@ lot of flour , sugar and fat are leading people to master up when you stop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in students .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken a theft , but is it taking a drop of water for your tea as well ?
check the with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they are saying to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inner .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying and you will have my compassion - but try to deal with it when my room@@ mate added to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
it is now in jail .
they should not make noise , the people with@@ holding from their sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b belongs to the people sitting in the Glass House .
a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it &apos;s something to make them qui@@ eter , drum and bass a little qui@@ eter , because at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they acted to this with even smar@@ ter music .
when they finally heard about 5 pm , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep even two hours before they cast their own music , closed their door and turned to their three @-@ hour trial .
would not be romantic , if your future spouse would happen to be involved in the same student residence ?
the other way around would it not be ab@@ y@@ ingly embarrassing when you keep a room@@ mate for your future adul@@ ter@@ ay , get in touch with them and then you have to see each day and maybe experience how to bring all shared friends to herself ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot @-@ room@@ mate is definitely not your future companion , try at least to engage your abdom@@ en a little reason .
at the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment in which you notice that somebody has separated his key in his not closed room is the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bullying , when it seems .
a good trick is fun , but it only takes moments until it gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
get through hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never even che@@ wing anybody &apos;s room with tooth@@ past@@ es and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water you can then put in the freezer - but t@@ wilight their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice notes .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single educ@@ ative , bar@@ ing@@ serving .
the real estate firm Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the middle @-@ colonial corner @-@ region for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need habit@@ ation but also the mother and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obli@@ ging &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

thousands of refugees will push for the home market .
the entrepreneur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner thinks of know how quickly a living space can be created : it builds in a project Town@@ house for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the home market .
which solution can you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass @-@ sized accommodation in containers or sne@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
because people remain a big part here .
in the light of the refugee stream , we also need plenty of living space in the coming decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
that is different when you put the people in hand @-@ swal@@ low .
each of the six buildings , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residen@@ ces for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be modified easily according to their respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is about 18@@ 4 000 euros , without a plot .
this is straightforward .
six months of construction took us .
this is reasonable .
did the construction rules make their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : in legal conditions , I have carried out my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the threatened construction @-@ value custom @-@ built and the actu@@ al@@ ance Reg@@ ulations .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it will still be underlined , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
there is only space in the towns where there is space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating new luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not true .
but do not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true yet , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but there are luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project also has the message , also ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother and the bar@@ ing@@ serving mother .
I show how it is possible to build cheap and well today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone OS when Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by typ@@ ing into &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software @-@ Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered after installation , as they get an error message , the coll@@ ar that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the issue , users will be advised to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean a dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has done that through the re@@ eling of the updates more likely . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is installed during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple &apos;s not letting the update continues since the phone could be switched on half way and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the updates .

&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the artist moved an hon@@ orary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was in the posting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ex @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers Tim meadow is un@@ well fallen in Bremen .
leg of all was once , by now Tim meadow , ex @-@ nationalist por@@ ters in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler .
after 30 kilograms of muscle mass , he has led to his own statement in the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , he has not assigned itself .
meadow only had the hair cut in the Bremer downtown , when he saw , as outside a par@@ quet room , a t@@ apping for his white Che@@ v@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro turned out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if burned out of the business , the official ( quasi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was ins@@ ul@@ ted to her , like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; is it from the City of Bremen .
only then I will decide if meadow is shown , or not .

men tested on 17 @-@ year Afgh@@ ans a
witnesses saw the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time , the group was at the height of the B@@ FT @-@ gas station .
on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons .
one of these men now scre@@ aming the young and hit this one with the fist in the face .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ back and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and pro@@ filed on the bat , he first left of his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was now home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group in a passenger car , leading up to their flat and demonstr@@ atively passed several times .
as one could no longer see the vehicle , the injured one went in front of the building , to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the contro@@ ll@@ able of a stroke , it swe@@ ep up the face and the sh@@ ank of the sla@@ man .
the last had to be taken to hospital for purposes of medical care .
so far there is only a very v@@ ague section description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 metres in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres and was clo@@ th@@ ed with an je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white dress .

Dr. Frank Müller takes the field of Fel@@ low@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen .
also , Sam@@ t@@ unite is looking forward to Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economics in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dorf by Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
doctors are missing in many places in the country - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller on 1st October took up the practice of Fel@@ ting ausen on the 1st of October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen goes to the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his successor over the coming months .
after a modification of construction , Müller opens the practice on October 12th , until then it will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in its premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship has met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently graduated in medical hospital education at the Wei@@ dener Hospital and also wants to get into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers are good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was come , I just started her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple of Müller made the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf , even in the future .
&quot; the proximity and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to experience and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss in the future .
and so one was agreed , the Mü@@ llers are bought the house with practice .
stay will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the two @-@ time family father , Frank Müller , who also grew up in his medical studies in Hannover and in various healthcare offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a trusted doctor in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed B@@ amp@@ ol@@ z in 2009 and is actively involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from the 19th of September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ber work as a household person , his wife UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both interfer@@ ing , want to be at home as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and lo@@ osing rates and need a consultation room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Mü@@ llers are awarded a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro as part of a subsi@@ dy of the administrative programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ unite Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ ting ausen , in the North of Germany &apos;s average practice , it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practice contract by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ se@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have been found , it would have gone .
those who attended the Expert Consult@@ ation period continues to be mostly seen in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professions and the puri@@ fication of the rim .
with their par@@ ting it ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practiced 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stri@@ ausen r@@ ack@@ able .
a little sad@@ ness she feels after the long time already .
&quot; but we are staying further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are sure to see , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is supple@@ mented by : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I have always pushed back to gardening , but things could be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the couple has two grandchildren and travels to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also being driven to our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Internal Affairs in Johanna Mik@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application , this can also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are top priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clear is also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs strong signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less flows of migrants , nor of the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled operation .
Croatia is killed &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia had let the upcoming refugees leave for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances , cor@@ ridors for refugees will be built .
however , this Minister of Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia is rather to intensify the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly checked as an external boundary .
as the Prime Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to present its borders to refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to go cross the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia to so@@ ak up the registration .
the Croatian police could use it in the near fields of corn .
since then , according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik regularly meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days I reck@@ on his country with some 4,000 refugees , &quot; Interior Minister Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
also buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , had been diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade agreed that it would be the people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor want to do it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , in any case , the first bus with approximately 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , during the course of the day further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were all night away from the about 500 kilometers distant of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border in Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has joined , so the police have told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
therefore , it could actually be the shift from the previous Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers of Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country prepared for the fall of a strong up@@ stream of refugees corresponding plans for possible outcomes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as non @-@ Schengen member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for the membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners since have a good record of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the left @-@ hand side there are about 300 refugees stuck in the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior ministers N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic gave an eye on Wednesday morning at a local bar@@ gain in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates about aging of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature ejaculation .
it would not at present be very high bar@@ gains .
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Sup@@ por@@ s advise immigrants to - dangerous - alternative to aging
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute to the refugees country maps , where alternative routes are shown by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there is still 20 years after the end of the Croatia War , still un@@ used e@@ min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ de@@ mining in the border region was sent .
every trading h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
support ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime criminal , which has been accused of having gained an insight into yet un@@ released financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place , and PR News@@ wire .
with the captured information , in@@ sider &apos;s transactions were made to the financial markets .
in this way , the investig@@ ators went to a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will ultimately be captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process against 32 further dis@@ cer@@ tains in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ endants were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are supposed to act in the U.S. and Eastern Europe as well .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ alisation took attention with this action at its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it is about life , that is why we have gone through action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; said Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the agenda of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ alisation is available to the pas@@ sers as well for questions and interviews like the volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while a Pass@@ ant is spontaneous to the Krei@@ de and watched the sentence for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; not long &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stay others short , read , say phrases as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they continue to develop little discussions about the action on the ver@@ ge of the action , the way of dealing with the death .

so this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to publicly tell the tablets , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death was still as@@ cop@@ ed with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although just the retirement movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open up .

Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the insured and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice , Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id is a good deal with its job and the experience and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offering of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ence offer is completely free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as further training and super@@ visions of the dying and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
every two years training is offered for new employees .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
there are also other personal wishes for post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , Fin@@ anz @-@ outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the song giant has earned his swe@@ eping views over a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and at higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ sport service .
the company also said it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set out 50,000 companies for the holiday season .
the stock fell over 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
analysts anticipated according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite price increases , the average of 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4 January becomes effective , and in spite of the higher sur@@ charges for Bod@@ spor@@ te of heavy and large packages that are being collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expects the result from the previous year to be increased due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid jobs when one gets weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the Riv@@ al U@@ PS , which plans to employ 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , about the same number as last year .
during the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned EUR 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expecting $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline in international pri@@ or@@ ship disp@@ atch in recent years , which brought sales to stagn@@ ation in its unit Express delivery .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has pushed the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of a higher cost of greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result was sun@@ k due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares amoun@@ ted to 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on her most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spent two days sitting this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras B@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide if it &apos;s time to lift the head start for almost a decade .
threatened with them at an end of the distributed , two @-@ stor@@ eyed seat sa@@ ws is the mur@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should appoint the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from the congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a bar@@ red third party : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to become reconc@@ iled by an unprecedented incentive for the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten up the more cautious F@@ ed represent@@ ants , this volati@@ lity of raising interest for federal government bonds - and is it just one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , the interest rate did not increase , the increased insecurity around the global market is enough justification , continues to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which secur@@ es itself to itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently interviewed by Bloomberg , a interest rate predicted this week .
however , the financial markets expect a lowering of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which indicates only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increased the sentence , unless that the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow before they promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage with 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ v@@ es@@ ome by Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest will calm the financial markets , because they will remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step towards a slow intensi@@ fication of the mon@@ astic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and in the early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving on the labour market this year was a solid .
the unemployment rate sank to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and , in the proximity of the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage rates have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly growing under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs it due to tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ xi@@ an , Che@@ zi@@ econom@@ ist at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets grew up all over the world at the end of the month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by more than 16 % amongst its peak , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would prop@@ el global growth .
the market has recovered something this month , with the Dow now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influence the complex calculation , when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the bree@@ der on this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former associates of the U.S. emergency bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait for at least one month to get the impact better on the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be affecting the U.S. economy and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is either one of the key factors of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision of decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was huge in recent years .
the mere reference to the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be &quot; con@@ stric@@ ted expansion &quot; con@@ stric@@ ted con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives can expect that it will not only be monitoring developments in other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more arts than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , note that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which with apparently not connected with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses a interest rate , cited its decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limited impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set the aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 Re@@ union donation in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence are not coming near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a raise , because the markets of upright , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be pre@@ matur@@ ely .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
offering a warm welcome is not without the involvement of inn@@ um@@ erable hon@@ orary volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ will@@ ful asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with her 74 lum@@ ination , she is also taught again .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , this is quite different to the right school .
Brazilian society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organisation SP@@ RS is trying to clarify some women in a sho@@ cking way that is important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results in this fact that a higher percentage of calories consumed was not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adjustment that should be handled .
a current study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet wa@@ ver women actually protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sports Hall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the council Bern@@ dt approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar power .
the planning for the long @-@ seen turn@@ around at Bern@@ rie@@ go Sport@@ s@@ land come first step by step : in the latest general council meeting , the extended construction presentation was pan@@ elled without big discussions .
previously , the Panel among others had yet adopted an application for a legal &quot; exception &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of the valid development plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form for the construction construction .
accordingly a &quot; saddle stit@@ ched roof with non @-@ co @-@ related first and roof @-@ top &quot; is to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the umbrella for solar power systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by this we get a wonderfully large South dd@@ ly together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an@@ a@@ version which is required for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan for the pen@@ ni@@ tion plan , no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ ber Council normally de@@ parts more restric@@ tive in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Res@@ cue &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in case of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is no recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not creating preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a joint project for the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated in costs .
grants are expected from the school and grass@@ roots sports .
in the next process of progress , the construction method for the 18 x 36 meters has now been referred to the District Fund for verification .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with the Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of Land@@ circle , the Wood@@ stock of Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the board of directors decides and the meeting on the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to be implemented .
the vast majority should be transported to fishermen and of the existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot work with Sch@@ ong@@ au can be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about their plans .
triggered the change of cancellation by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the main director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of who the successor is to compete , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes into play , which was prepared to take over the leadership from 1 October and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au be@@ aming this in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
over the next two years , fishermen are supposed to agree with his team , when the Supervisory Board manages to agree on both houses , until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , finally ended up close to almost 140 years .
so far the district is planned for 2018 , if the ongoing refurb@@ ishment is completed at the Hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim .
Far@@ mers Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the super@@ visory board , joined T@@ ans , where the house , which is owned by the federal fl@@ yers , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White was not saying , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ sp@@ sych@@ i@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer talks about the Qu@@ asi @-@ relocation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which has been working as a che@@ er for over 30 years , has not existed .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was strongly threatened in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are demanded today ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) on the Berg@@ isches HC .
the leader of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal today is the clear favourite , occasion for su@@ bre@@ t@@ ality , however , is none .
in the last season the bad@@ ener participated in the B@@ HC a hur@@ tful defeat and have to make something good there .
Jag@@ ni@@ vor@@ ed with two injured during Pr@@ at@@ au
two transform@@ ers were seriously injured during their harv@@ ests at the Tuesday morning by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( District of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police s@@ acked .

how exactly it could come to the accident it was clear .
the det@@ ective police determined .

the kill@@ ings of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , how Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor and police met on Wednesday .

refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
also more refugees are looking for a pay@@ able place .
pressure on the apartment market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with decent citizens about the last affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , there would have to be 400@@ ,000 new units to be built up by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this conclusion , a study enters on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare , this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be finished in Germany .
that lacks 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees after the first three months of their stay are no longer obligated to live as asylum seekers in a period of accommodation .
many come across the flat market and stand in the long sn@@ akes before the apartment rentals .
according to statistics , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived during the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , lies not only at the rising refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany presents a &quot; deficit &quot; in front of itself , which is bigger from year to year .
we currently missing in the metropolitan areas already around 77@@ ,000 housing units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals , therefore , lived in big cities with penetr@@ ated in W@@ G @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ tarily stayed in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; for the F@@ lu@@ te on the apartment market .
in big cities the number of square meters per person has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to resolve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is propos@@ ing a rel@@ a@@ unch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to stimulate new incentives for social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved for the under@@ world tax and the basic tax for sponsored apartments will be suspended .
additionally , according to the alliance , attractive tax allow@@ ness is needed .
the Sup@@ porting Programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is now working well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at the Monday of 18@@ 4 million , more than half of the Euro had already been granted to some 300 million euros .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free conduct : Croatia and Slovenia do offer corridor
there is practically no traffic back to Hungary since more and more refugees leave the road to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing to allow the transit of Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to cope with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian internal Minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian interior ministers Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country has not yet been a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees died from Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik , reports Croatian @-@ distance RT@@ L .
Hungary had a border to refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which occurred on the same day , do virtually unnecessary asylum in Hungary virtually unnecessary .
Croatia wants to make refugees leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can come through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , it is women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees during the morning at the border of Serbia on the EU neighbouring Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and with Ta@@ xen into the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after they arrived , they would have tried to walk across the Croatian border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees encounter not in the border zone .
for this the border between other dangers ent@@ ails : there are sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining should therefore quickly create a secure passage .
after the closure of the border no longer refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 imposed people .
shortly before Tor@@ zi@@ on on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the rise and damage of the threshold to us as a criminal offen@@ se .
in the South @-@ Hungary border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
depos@@ ited prison dates for up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration office , it was conducted on Tuesday in the newly elected &quot; tr@@ ams &quot; in a total of 94 Asy@@ a , of which nearly all - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning we would have stopped for 40 refugees here .
however , no one has more views to obtain asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit routes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we started to regulate things .
they gathered the trash , which had left thousands of people over the past few weeks on the road@@ side .
pl@@ y@@ break@@ ra@@ ils were built and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
for the purpose of this construction , nobody wanted to express .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria reach only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country also increased its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants were still staying in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 men waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning of the German authorities .
in Shim@@ ano , smaller groups of refugees met for walking .
Mayor went &quot; civili@@ zed &quot; about the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the rooms , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; was Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , due to the refugee stream , was for it in Wern@@ stein said , &quot; Fre@@ el@@ ler , who immediately accepted his help and the str@@ ap@@ ed together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Middle Pass@@ au .
previously we had the un@@ hoped guests only once , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said town@@ s@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
one man could not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 euros for fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very much appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relatives were on Sunday evening in Wels on the Sunday evening in Wels to a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to make it after the short @-@ term re@@ pro@@ vement , that the rail transport to Germany was dis@@ continued but still trying to cross the border .
in the regional train , however , was placed opposite the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein this cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on Sunday previously a bi@@ dding light - organized by the Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further Z@@ ig@@ en@@ nia to us , is a log@@ istical result of a hypo@@ de policy :
rather than help in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures to help Human@@ ism , our Chancellor has officially moved up the position of the Hungarian government into the secret of National Socialists .
unfortunately , the mor@@ se of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the bor@@ der@@ lands with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the prayers will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borrowed country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the nearest winter , with decent conditions for protection seekers .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 ma@@ inst@@ able quarters
finally , he has all hands to do with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad it is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has used the previous powerful Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banker , to raise bul@@ ls for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first trial center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got the handle on its own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday falls without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; champi@@ onships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Interior Ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; cr@@ ot@@ ony situation . &quot;
in total , it counts on a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the He@@ ur@@ ary year .
in order to meet the number , have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations within the next few weeks - 20,000 people should provide around € 15,000 the deal .
if there are more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no fall without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ rad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already been holding talks with the cent@@ uri@@ ons .
this would have secured it to him , even for the coming refugees neighbour@@ hoods .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ M@@ atar supports Con@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby becoming clear how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high expectations of asylum coordinator also puts into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ pers as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
also I hope for hotels that are empty during winter time .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it can not be that a certain amount of handles or size of the duties must have to be respected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that he is successful in contrast to the Interior Ministry in the accommodation , Con@@ grat@@ est ended with his experience .
I am an older master , which one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness be his most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs as they declared themselves .
your employees want to increase them on three to four .
the own initiative was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container up at the square Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there may be problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
for the first time , no opening of municipal sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for providing refugees is planning the City of Linz .
this is not necessary , as the persons currently can accommodate without these measures , &quot; says Mayor of Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , further sites are to be tested for their bar@@ gain .
critic@@ ising the Stadt@@ manager at the division of refugees within the Bundes@@ länder .
also other districts must contribute their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not torn down &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) hold the course of action in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has given me assur@@ ances that German boundaries are not torn down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the appropriate border controls as well .
special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special suits with refugees after Germany will be no longer available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guards , however , would have brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU Member States P@@ ag@@ it@@ ans once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that Austria once again enters into controls in Austria is a logical cor@@ oll@@ ary &quot; of the action of Germans as ag@@ it@@ ator .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the line of Lin@@ zer is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is mobili@@ zed , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meter ) has to be rented to young , innovative companies from the field of technology .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine , in the start @-@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later on which data are to be acquired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start , S &amp; T want to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building dates from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 @-@ square plots in the building have been le@@ ased , for a further 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni In@@ flu@@ ff opened second business in the Ar@@ k@@ ade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually , J@@ utta wanted to develop a dog later .
this project had to tigh@@ ten the 49 @-@ year In@@ tu@@ te of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the tau@@ ben@@ market Ar@@ k@@ ade . finally , she has now received an increase in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the shop , in which it sells them among other cases bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garment of different manufacturers , now all about men &apos;s hand@@ bags from the Fur@@ la , w@@ allets are available from 75 euros .
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks had been modified .
&quot; but I long over@@ lay out if I want to open a store , &quot; says broad .
decisive for the decision was among others that even the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags be sold .
&quot; we are the star@@ ry in the big room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has its own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has wide extended by her mother to the cradle .
especially , when something develops and I can show new trends at a high @-@ performance level .
why so many women ask at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in timi@@ zation , the specialist can not be answered with the latest safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag has upgraded every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ aker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called an@@ geber .
this feature links also to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US President wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for isolation .
whether he is advoc@@ ating xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists or di@@ lators in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. presidential election has a strong impact on the election campaign .
and cuts well with me .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate @-@ bear comes from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is to many in win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road a notion .
man@@ ners in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is over -@@ zig corners with it related .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaigns .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers consider to be the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow they find somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their kan@@ ten@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native cr@@ ammed earth has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous explo@@ sives , among which also Tr@@ ump also became the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be successful also if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
although there are respect for the performance of the family , but it also tends to be that tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a great en@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random &quot; the nickname of the nickname which K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle have , &quot; The Br@@ uns@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - become High @-@ German : the geber , &quot; she says .
therefore , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for Gold Rus@@ ves in the United States .
foundation of the real estate group were first property purchases in New York .
but the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home to the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was then included back then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once ch@@ ew without approval , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Folklore , Roland Paul , went to the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrast to the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendants .
the latter had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and claimed the building of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ ishes , this is not so sympathetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relationship ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a newborn tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was borrowed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ res@@ sing , &quot; he is always so sincere . &quot;
believes that Tr@@ ump sometimes comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never handled things around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ t Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm stated like man@@ ned K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a follow @-@ up of the family Heinz during a visit to the church sp@@ ire , which was generally well organized .
&quot; this can I not imagine of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they make it better if he chose the choice , because &quot; he has such radical opinions , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sag@@ as at the time of his grandfather in the US were as if he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting issues than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ et@@ ter Sarah Dance .
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are mature even without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump was interviewed for long , have seen 12 000 chin @-@ singers , even in the U.S. the interest is awakening .
the Bav@@ arian municipality Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; .
in the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village received the award for rolling tourism in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den since Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain mountain@@ e@@ ers . &quot;
in neighbouring country the Alpine Club is responsible for the award of awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; must have at most 2,500 inhabitants at the most .
at least one fifth of its area must be exp@@ elled as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership positions at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson is looking to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of the leaders in the liber@@ als , but there has not been a major postpon@@ ement in the Reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the capital &apos;s capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ strike , the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival@@ ry Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ mbly , hidden in London as part of a wee@@ kl@@ ong series of international television programs , which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun .
this draw@@ back of the time seemed to play a role for Australian TV spectators as Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ ,000 viewers at the five main cities , as compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in relation to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , there has been a gap to Sun@@ rise in the last few months .
in August there is an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators about 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these things more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are all right , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ alization of packed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who un@@ closes with his two children on the New Zealand Coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could enter a hit @-@ show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed in strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and precip@@ it@@ ated easily The block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L &apos;@@ ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the last three voices in line : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly un@@ know@@ ingly obvious to who The Bachelor wins .
the woman in the bach@@ elor &apos;s Sam in The Bachelor was finally closed , was covered in the world &apos;s largest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not say if they were the one that has received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows the day before coming out of three two , you might possibly accidentally put an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday exp@@ elled
all three women have proved themselves in a ly@@ ric way , why wood is the perfect man and stressed their sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude about why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was to receive the Woods situation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the kill@@ joy of who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki disappeared both quickly - except for itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies I noticed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam were really well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ ack@@ ay said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; baby photo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she made clear to her that there could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly of it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to whom Wood was asked , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ over girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 clock , on Ten .
originally published as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ von@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams , who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have banned from the rest of the game to the bank when he lost an angel as he did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League conver@@ ti@@ t in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula became familiar with his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continue to show his true colours in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team to gr@@ ind the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam was reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged also by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who ri@@ bs him to forget his patented catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ von@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rol at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game of Minnesota Vi@@ dova .
it was certainly not the start to expected the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian partnership for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble , and told later the Australian radio duo T@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse starting in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that &apos;s going on , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne bequ@@ e@@ ver the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin debut there in 2007 , when a pass leading in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
altogether it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne headed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and po@@ ked it on his Inst@@ agram .
El@@ ton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of g@@ ays

the Free elec@@ torate asks for the high refugee figures the adjustment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria .
senior Finance Minister and Leader of Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger was at the start of the F@@ W @-@ Fall @-@ ship in a large crisis at Bay@@ erns Schulen , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get Ver@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ rush of Free elec@@ tors will be conven@@ ed until Friday in the Paris Commun@@ e .
actually , quite other main themes were provided .
but the record number of refugees also dominates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the subject of asylum is super@@ imposed on the clause &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , like it did during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes no further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger asked more staff for the administrative courts said to be responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ inver@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder do not pursue : &quot; we need federal standard standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern shifts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is where we need to be more capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics in large lo@@ dges should not fall under the table .
a years of endurance will remain on the agenda : the policy of education .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister , Ludwig Sp@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) on 47 upper secondary school pilot plus , launched , with an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ tic intermediate level from three to four years - in a result it will take nine years to become a diploma .
but this does not go too far enough .
&quot; the theme G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we demand freedom of freedom for all higher level schools who want to .
free ride at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .

4 people killed after shooting with rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal when the police bul@@ ls in a crowd , demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the force broke out at the Tuesday evening in the R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , approximately 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ kal D@@ ha@@ kal , director of the district , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , whereby some of them threw stones and fire @-@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ ar@@ eng@@ a and pushed back into the air before it went back on rubber flip .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , known by which they can indeed kill , but they are traditionally used as less fatal alternative , apparently a so high death rate produced .
the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Occup@@ ation say that new provinces , which would be formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal about the ethnic group of sh@@ arus who want to create their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflicts since 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution is on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lature have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction planned in the city
the plot with the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city currently prepar@@ es everything for the marketing of the 4000 metres of square meters .
there is a mixture of trade , commercial and living - special offers are not available .
Em@@ den - The City Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the youth centre of the Alte Post .
the preparations for this are running now .
plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor @-@ question I am , is not yet clear .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly , no contracts were closed .
the town Em@@ den had one part of the property , which lies on the Ring Road / Ecke Great Street , just a few months ago and disman@@ tle the building that is located .
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the plans to spend the holiday cottage at the little sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor gave publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several songs are further worried - they are worried about selling their leisure time
once a month , the doors closed , hur@@ led , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday cottage are located at the small seaside near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night in the Municipal Executive Committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , that point was standing on the public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project @-@ critic and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ers passed from the System @-@ Bau Management board into the offensive : &quot; we still don &apos;t have the answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the agents , and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
for months it has been in the discussion about ten to twelve million Euros .
fierce reactions among sea land@@ owners who had come to the meeting prov@@ oked the pictures and new details about the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and Board member of the group representatives of the An@@ lie@@ ger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve compl@@ ained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z who dominates the rest of the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that would increase traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as all the bus @-@ inv@@ itations will come , so that it reck@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the good a hect@@ are of the former restaurant , is however still open .
still there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to receive a logical concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of this l@@ acked , also the development plans are still variable .

Google will start a double @-@ sided donation campaign to gather 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling pilot campaign that aims to help thousands of refugees who are he@@ ap@@ ed by the thousands of refugees , as they flee from war and impover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations on his blog .
instead of letting a Manager make the announcement , Rita M@@ oud , a Google assistant who had escaped with her family from Kab@@ ul than she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; to our journey belonged to many dark stations and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
the donations are paid to four non @-@ profit organizations which provide assistance to refugees and migrants ; doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million in Model / S@@ eller to 11 million $ doubled .
Europe has been facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has been driven more than 4 million people this year .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death statements need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on a new study in J@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight @-@ loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity have proven to be efficient for treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e high @-@ fat with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) from 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI between 25 or more is that somebody is overweight and people with a BMI 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers were collected from Tai@@ wan@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have been collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c , and ga@@ stri@@ c help - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those that have been subjected to this operation dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this trial .
meanwhile the BMI with those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal in 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , with 36 % the diabetes disease , dissolved itself totally and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to the diabetes , it is completely only at one percent and , in part , only about two percent .
in addition , the results were with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , who reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ ber@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent , write the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ ation of A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decreased mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also included average results for the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass Ro@@ b group had lost more weight compared to the Ga@@ ther@@ ectomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater back@@ wards in the BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ iled in A@@ 1@@ c ( € 3.1 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit to the surgery five years ago , there are indications of a study of serious people in Sweden that takes surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was all obes@@ e people who subjected themselves to an obesity operation , roughly 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival with surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it was soothing for people with a BMI between 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in that lower BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without higher risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love @-@ history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently increasingly paying attention in Nar@@ r@@ ative F@@ ic@@ tion : a young woman , to shoulder @-@ times un@@ popular and un@@ sigh@@ tly , after years meets the sho@@ al of her youth and she fell in love with her .

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot include all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised , and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East lie .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford that matters to ethics .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also emphasized that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in coping with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ultimately must think about how the killing in their countries is diminished .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action to the terrorist bombing of September 11 , and turned out that the violent response of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my confes@@ sion in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put force , and this has brought up unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ gestion of hand@@ craft by children in the last 4 years
tox@@ aph@@ an in the US is about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low the alcoholic and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant so that Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenues of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years of age , the tox@@ aph@@ as are reported , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more frequent in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out of emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or for a mut@@ probe in social media .
videos on YouTube showed how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap dinner .
juven@@ iles have said to have a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ balanced mou@@ th@@ wash to maintain a tougher drink .
younger children can be attracted by an attractive fragrance of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are par@@ ak@@ ed .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant of straw@@ berry , grapes and orange pe@@ els which are very appealing for children .
hand@@ some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with young children can result in a few spra@@ ys to alcohol po@@ is@@ oned .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison gas station in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , on Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let a sip whis@@ ky around , but people let this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lash of color to straw@@ berry and hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into an emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ smo@@ kes@@ centr@@ ation was higher in 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to be drunk at an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical practitioner , who treats it at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ apped her words and was not able to go when she joined emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s home to signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had himself joined the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very scary , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ators and to store hand@@ some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario for the gor@@ ges of hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employers of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol has been contained , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which has been noted as active ingredients .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; sculp@@ ted &quot; teacher turned to poison@@ ing by setting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so there was a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
the police regarded the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and trans@@ disciplinary measures to the school authority .

the ex @-@ player @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former member of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador to Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland do not show any highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranking is not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the ranking .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ fir@@ m games and there are not just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I &apos;ll be taking things around , hur@@ ting D@@ ei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Celtic needs to fight but the Norwegian head sw@@ ath to turn around things .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ ei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we do it exactly so - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic because it makes the player better .
together , it is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July in 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole grew in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5,@@ 9 percent was surv@@ eyed over that of 5.5 per cent , as showed the figures of the office for national statistics ( ons ) .
in the meantime , employment fell to 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent during the qu@@ artet - a number over the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I become a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a later day , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it is not happening , I will sit in a viewers in the death row in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is executed by the tox@@ injection .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation took place first in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I started to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see directions in the United States , and as often more applications are available as seats available , a macro@@ lottery take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma does not count the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will detect it emoti@@ onally .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard glos@@ si@@ ps with a colleague , with whom I developed my own relationship over the course of the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record , what I see .
I simply have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access .
I judge myself at her .
she adm@@ its that she could have worked better , but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong as to what I do .
Richard Con@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even though he would do it .
I told him he can take me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is un@@ guilty .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of deed .
yet , I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death row .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to which you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means for a man to see an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy seems that ste@@ wards &quot; tried to pi@@ ate him and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy seems that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to re@@ install one sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and im@@ it@@ ated the race to stop immediately .
he directed to ste@@ wards and the integrity issues of Racing Victoria and asser@@ ted that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult circumstances when it was the positive cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ Lake in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had taken back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to be &quot; out@@ lived &quot; as too much ch@@ and@@ ed grapes . &quot;
&quot; I recently had nothing to say about it , and I have long been chat@@ ting , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know it far .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I said .
I &apos;ll go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk about the main ones , and I want my owners think I try my best to try them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I must think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration department has tried to pi@@ ate his stable .
&quot; from eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will design@@ ate him - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they clearly believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , for they have failed to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy &apos;s President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this lead me to the view that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave and probably does people outside our trainers take charge of what is occurring within the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
maybe they must take my license and fail me and I don &apos;t have a doubt that what I am saying to now think about it now .
but I am now at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push it out to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the creative levels of the coach have built up with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to he said he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of the un@@ loaded master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the Rac@@ ec@@ et treatment rule &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack s@@ lu@@ dge or tune had been recorded onto the horse &apos;s deb@@ tor , which were opposed to the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ eous mud on the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening like that .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was also how it was .
but it also had such a good day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a dre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ gen dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this proposition was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy goes back against rivals for declarations to Ring@@ fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ ere has critics in the Tac@@ kling of his player as an &quot; Agenda @-@ setting &quot; by two premi@@ er league of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster trainers Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the p@@ ment@@ ers will have allowed the Storm @-@ player &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm Sie@@ gs in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett showed a little crazy note to the Storm @-@ Team after his team succeeded in winning the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland was not &quot; too good &quot; in the race .
Bell@@ una defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ una added that the critique of two leading trainers at his team makes him confident , because it inspir@@ es that they were about to be struck by the Storm &apos;s team .
&quot; this comes up and over and over again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talks about Ring@@ fights , when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ cre@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that nothing is changed at our defensive system or techniques all year long . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real emphasis , and that has been demonstrated for us in the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already wei@@ rd as this always emerges at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ una has attacked the concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ rah Dra@@ gons played the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he relaxed his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ cre@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a te@@ dious team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play , and which we see as exciting , especially its young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , making them feel like this .
I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago she was probably not thinking of us when it was a big games .
Bell@@ una also pointed out that the game Storm against roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 and there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and does not give any points of cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the schedules .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet again .
the Storm @-@ team has free this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the finals at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts on next Tuesday morning .
ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ savings on drugs an@@ age
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his test to come to the possession of 40 kil@@ ogram co@@ ca@@ ine , which were damaged to Queensland , was freed up against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Ech@@ o .
despite a possibly li@@ vable punishment for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic having argued that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been from an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason .
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear links with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; declared the court on Wednesday .
at the pen@@ al matter he gave the police a lie on his where@@ ab@@ ode .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and maternal father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly offered to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ v@@ est declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of $ 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Supp@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from having to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he res@@ isted his Australian and his Ser@@ b pas@@ sports who ch@@ ores the police on a daily basis and abide by a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the mass makes it : every two years the Motor@@ cycle show its novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
2015 is primarily a movement in the compact car , which is currently especially well sold .
cars from the compact class are at the moment in demand : about 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were detected in August this segment , according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( audience days 17th to 27 September ) .
there are many new compact models between all the futur@@ istic concept and luxury cars and luxury cars this year .
one of the biggest Premi@@ ers for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , who will stand in the autumn with the dealers .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it is part of the brand .
as a result the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive for it .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Germany . Opel is opening an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at 5@@ 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the A@@ stra provides a new 1.4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
in addition , the H@@ esse represents another diesel engine and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / 200 PS , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engine .
unlike the most important competition VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel A@@ stra first contains only as fi@@ ves .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi which is already seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will be raised next to the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A in new comp@@ acts ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his A@@ stra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is used exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and empha@@ sizes sporting GT .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are deserted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Federal Office of Justice , which was accomo@@ dated in a small cell for the months .
because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners have princip@@ ally entitled to financial compensation , if they are accommodated in small cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision released at the end of Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those affected may even hope to receive money if there were only a few days locked in close spaces ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe , he was lo@@ dged in the Federal Employment office Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meter floor space ; the toilet was spatial , not sealed off .
after that , the man , who has now returned to the free cell according to the information of his lawyer .
his official lay @-@ down charges due to the in@@ vigor@@ ous prison conditions for the country of Berlin were failed .
but the constitutional judge laid down the judgment of the Chamber of Dep@@ end@@ ent Berlin and rejected this case for renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity violated .
finance District now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons for the interim period only a few days of port @-@ age for compensation would have been decisive for the compensation , be a compens@@ atory claim , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a black@@ ening of the legal protection of the personality would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber of legislation must now be clarified the amount of the money damage .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge have often in@@ vigor@@ ated the rights of prisoners in the past .
so , in April they spoke in@@ mate ; because he was lying naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multi@@ multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , a mate of such a prisoner , had st@@ alled a decent accommodation in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was carried out during three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in an identical cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons have been coming to the headlines in the last weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always locked in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ vity desc@@ ends , even to r@@ ack@@ et , it should have already been due to the tense situation .
according to information from the pres@@ pres@@ sors , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of youngsters , 19 to 2016 exp@@ ire .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration to refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to statement by vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create this and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens in Germany provides the following overview .
the forecast of between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments annually renewed every year - and the next five years .
that &apos;s almost twice as much as has been built ( 25@@ 0@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but especially in paid salary : between 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments from the rental agreement , and these particularly favourable apartments will apply to refugees .
Federal Minister of Law in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) aims to double @-@ double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing should have to arise annually and for this the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
one can also agree that scientists and federal ministries agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in residential building .
according to the Institute for Employment Research ( German labour market research ) , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany are available for long @-@ term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked at all after their qualifications needed to help them start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudia Walter , Project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for esteem in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the emig@@ rants , it says migration researcher Diet@@ rich throne .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt there has been a political turning point : from work to refugees for recognition of work .
while a working ban on asylum seekers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as are the residen@@ ces to asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the skilled workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skilled workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have prevailed the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is not yet an exclusive offer of general and professional language courses .
studies show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore a view of the Thr@@ es@@ ide from the Royal Road to the re@@ integration .
the Berlin school administration found that few refugees put their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root of their parents , it is only once very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ š@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to overlook the family , nevertheless convince by the advantages of the K@@ ita , distribute the administration hand advertisements in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by carrying more specialist schools .
in the countries students are prepared without a knowledge of classes in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by full @-@ trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second @-@ language .
there is no shortage , says Pra@@ ate St@@ acked from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
basically , no federal states asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was until Berlin , inside the Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) , now gave up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio @-@ free refugees could be facilitated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with such a fle@@ d@@ ment or debt do not receive any achievements according to the asylum dra@@ wer system , if they begin a study .
the latter is generally not getting a BA@@ Fö@@ G because they do not fall under the circle of the peasant persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ tens up to 15 months .
but even this funding gap has to be closed , please , Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state ought to embrace the equal rights signs of Islam , as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ Chur@@ ches develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish a Islamic welfare system that takes care of newcom@@ ers .
the rights are also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , representatives of Islam must be clear and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to resolve some criticism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ z , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts may also be brought to Germany .
those who want to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to be here at times , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will be a lot more today than the issue of the whole society in future .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a fourth decade an anti @-@ discrimination figure , and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it was very slow , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder target showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders do not require a long time to call for international treaties such as anti @-@ rac@@ ist violence , must be realised in the next few years , when the country will peacefully and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is capable of providing medical assistance to the previously expected refugees , the Secretary of Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; regarding al@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , extra money must be incorporated into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery Schulz demands equal to all com@@ ers in the registration health cards .
provided services could later be rep@@ lic@@ ated with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly questionable , so many people with the limited power catalogue that apply the asylum pay@@ able law .
otherwise , physicians make the most of all the language barriers .
even until now , the Berlin scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting worse over their diseases as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices would have to be interpre@@ ting , it demands .
however , many refugees would also be helping in an emergency hospital for many refugees also .
and with a different diagnostic view .
among refugee camps about it may be clearly more untreated , and in the young people go to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partial other cases of disease , German doctors came from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite dis@@ infection or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as regards the sleeve of the sleeve , it is perhaps even a allevi@@ ation caused by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a high developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
if they may be allowed to practice , however , they would have to pass through their qualifications and be dis@@ car@@ ded once more ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees in Germany today are mentally ill for estimates of the bundle ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorders or under depression .
especially vulnerable to be refugee , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU Munich stated that every fifth Syrian refugee area is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
he who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from other things at flas@@ h@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ ras@@ a and death @-@ death .
other symptoms include bed@@ - and concentration @-@ dys@@ functions , strong co@@ hor@@ ic and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
to prevent that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees will receive a psycho@@ therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , psych@@ ologically sick persons seeking asylum seekers in the welfare offices can make a request for a psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices mostly Sach@@ al@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , decide if a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dreams

for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus in the hands of the family lives .
the gift of inspiration of the family now in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday schedule and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ au with world @-@ flair &quot; , &quot; said director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept .
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the Cir@@ cus convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ ary aro@@ v c@@ lown draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in her spell .
the Castillo Brothers &apos; have also understood its hand@@ craft .
the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ movies do not want to record the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s her@@ ons in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ reserves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger@@ tip and artic@@ ular .
to balance with the unic@@ ycle on a sphere ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
slim @-@ beings fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics how little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
griev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often a matter of different animal protection organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; it is not good for our animals , it also does not work well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a stro@@ p unit .
the &quot; four @-@ legged companions , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read after every wish of their eyes .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
feel the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the ring .
the top@@ most commandment is : good for the animals to worry about .
specially for their zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very proud .
the two animals have lived together in a c@@ ages for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; yet , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was here , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id still is not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
for each visitor something should be thereby part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewer , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;

Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the staircase at the beginning of the year .
this remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly became aware of the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition that they could have received anonymous deaths and had been fore@@ warned to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ischer .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates are standing in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and as long as his rehabilitation goes according to Plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss the next four games for England during the next four games and in the face of its history , its involvement in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le , and then returned to his old swing back during the off @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not well healed .
it is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his knees , or with the injury that he had before .
this may be true of purely medical view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player is trying to get back in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd reports 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als of 157 Lig@@ el , in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight games times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League &apos;s clubs were clubs which have recorded most of the offen@@ ders .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believe that an improvement in the risk of injuries will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a decent time period , a time when you strengthen your body and win pol@@ ation , &quot; he said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham &apos;s hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also arrive with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud , instead of night@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players that need to give a little break down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites , by group F further , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the biggest trac@@ tive effects in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated , after 41 Games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ conqu@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , whereby on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that Arsenal won the lesson of last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation over Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ reaching hope with his management to lead the association to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked at the arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other side I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now is more dist@@ res@@ sed than ever before , how su@@ icide , among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mission@@ er@@ urs ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ard@@ ent life ) 2015 can be seen as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need it .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to challenge this challenge .
a recent study at over 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms , found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery is tw@@ o@@ fold .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to make a friendship .
in the age of communication , communicating with its emphasis on social media , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists must name Armen@@ ian values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beautiful at Friends was that these focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his labor , but by his personality , which shiny by the interaction as a friend .
the jo@@ kes of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s hu@@ gs , moments when foot@@ ball@@ ots in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely go back , even if they often hold back completely their feelings to explore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone past@@ oral care stated to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening skills to people who are pressed and are com@@ mon@@ ish to me , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling of it being perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term planting mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone to help people in moments of despair may also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest with the setting of the day completely newly designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone sitting around , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might be .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ feast
di Maria goes to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates by Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and his son Cav@@ ani , after his turn against Malmö .
di Maria has her debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to get to Malmö .
here are the Games report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and her son Cav@@ ani continued the course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ted park on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ bie , who brought the French champion to the road but afterwards they passed a number of occasions before they finally achieved a head office when Cav@@ ani moved to the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek out the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ mid @-@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no clone of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ z@@ r@@ vic@@ s turning chances in front of the gate . he was later published in the game against his hometown team and against the association , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to gain 2 : 0 to cause our opponents &apos; problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have yet perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team which could hold on the weekend 1 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was planted in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine wings was referred to as the man , who took the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated , why when he went to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense prior to he completed in Johan Wil@@ and gone beautiful into the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great win , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off , proposed to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was confronted with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field , a heavy opponent .
but except a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who sub@@ mits far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ carriage and bad duc@@ ts , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was in no less than five trials alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used it after the restart .
nevertheless he dis@@ missed a lot more skill when he got his te@@ amm@@ ates into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , transformed the Di Maria into a revol@@ ving which was subject to the P@@ ill@@ ar in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally dropped shortly after the hours mark - thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus generated his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had folded a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
the ended all thoughts of Malmö can come back into the game , and only an excellent entry of Wil@@ and from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement parts made in Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in the movies .
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ us film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said , she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , with respect to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; secured Dam@@ on .
brown has re@@ acted , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . ok , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian had joined .
Dam@@ on and Brown concluded the product @-@ mates to Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as she said the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a nuts being defeated by her white sugar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People was nominated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on drow@@ ned that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the Social Media was explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on Com@@ ment .
Twitter @-@ user Mr Po@@ oni commented his anger about the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - this is SO W@@ IN@@ K that hur@@ ts me . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ ri@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on comments are coming at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black lives Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide effect and sup@@ planted law@@ makers and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured eggs .
in February the singer Prince has made a play@@ back to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album sil@@ ently , &quot; ( albums are still showing their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums are still their meaning .
more recently , the leaders of the Black lives Mat@@ ter have published a statement in recent years and reaction to the question of the Fox @-@ News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as an hatred object .
&quot; the Network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , which are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west .
whether he had accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope , it is unclear .

the professional sports@@ clim@@ bers and operator of Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million home .
the contest , which completed their 7th season , had never experienced a contest participants , which could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season of the season there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the Fin@@ als .
the last task was to climb , on a 75 feet long climbing rope , in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten had ended the task within the time when he finished the first athlete , who ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero stopped this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the Grand Award of 1 million $ .
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or a life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money .
as suddenly as I can imagine ... as it is ... the future is unknown .
the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ por@@ ters to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten had ended first at all the course , not just your prize money .
according to the rules , the money is transferred to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great gray .
I don &apos;t think he likes it a gro@@ wer .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
to the masses of awards , he received from fans .

Detroit Tig@@ ers cre@@ eping in Minnesota T@@ wins over
Min@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly she was one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tigers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support maintained as Detroit offered three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) performed 6 times in 1 / 3 interior and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third @-@ successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the Bull@@ pen each game and therefore I want to go into the game entirely .
the nomin@@ ee tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Martin@@ ez had three matches and was in two deer , his first R@@ B@@ Is for mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits on the Seattle nav@@ al on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has pushed the wood very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( blow @-@ up ) , looked clearly better from the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three rats in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh , the T@@ wins had the best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ ding Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left line line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a bun@@ gee , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Du@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ zer res@@ dy .
Har@@ dy was passed by the wall , the only man , with whom he was faced , in front of the nomin@@ ee re@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who started the righ@@ tw@@ ing Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finishing @-@ run of the second , Ver@@ ges got the third bas@@ eman a pedal on a double play .
it was the major league leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ les proposed a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ run at the end of the ne@@ bottom inn@@ ings , wall of a R@@ BI , stand against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed sh@@ out however S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game of a still non movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rats in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veteran , which had been canc@@ eled before the match from the viol@@ i list after he had been missing more than a month due to a tail@@ oring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning which I would have wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more confident when I put up and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ man in the first , we got a single single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez qualified his 0 @-@ 21 successes series with the lap@@ tops in the scoring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand side , abol@@ ished a further run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers presented in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not get too well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , does not produce any points in the third inning , before being replaced by the rail@@ road holder A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ser .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ es at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez broke out because of a violation of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is run by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the S@@ án@@ chez shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the viol@@ ability list because of a school sh@@ out , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is rep@@ ain@@ ted from the viol@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the Director of Munich &apos;s security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s resol@@ ute thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was going to look forward to the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago you had been happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict cr@@ ashing ahead of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance on the spot for refugees .
Austria controlled on Southern and Eastern borders
Germany also established Austria &apos;s controls in its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Secretary of Johanna Heu@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , after Hungary now nobody will be returned .
Germany also sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is not agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the question of an agreement , after Germany could resume a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , who had already dealt with relevant discussions between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers called them not and dis@@ missed on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the last days tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria for thousands of refugees .
your goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann appointed one special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new attempt to binding the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee camps in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal government in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
in cooperation with the countries of the Chancellor , the federal government announced that shortly after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor of Berlin on the late Tuesday evening .
Merkel under@@ lining the people who need protection , complain of this too .
but those who have no lead , can not stay in Germany too .
this view has been over@@ thrown in the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge power of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are thousands of left refugees in the meantime on the Bal@@ ans route .
Hungary had closed a long border with Serbia at night for Tuesday .
only a few hours waiting for the government in Budapest to tie the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia on the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ gs of tu@@ gs from Romania - Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was the first ar@@ rests of people who had sli@@ pped the fence .

the researchers show their analysis in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes contains a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather sli@@ pped .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them stick B @-@ vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Be@@ fore mainly include man@@ gos but lots of vitamin A and their pre @-@ level beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
who eats the fruits thus supports visual , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too tight or smell .
the form@@ work alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they naturally taste pure or in sweet food .
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
they are allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of leaf sal@@ ads like Chic@@ or@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits nicely with fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lamb and wild .

first F@@ öhn@@ storm , then distinctive K@@ alt@@ front
the coming night is breaking through the valleys of the Lake F@@ öhn , during the coming night , which h@@ acked on Tuesday , like Mete@@ o@@ Schweiz on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night of th@@ urs@@ day , the blow @-@ dryer is partially blown by the com@@ mu@@ le through the com@@ promis@@ ers .
on Thursday morning we crossed a distinctive cold @-@ front , the vigor@@ ous rainf@@ alls , squ@@ alls and a temperature decline .
if Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure @-@ area above the British islands in a strong south @-@ west flow .
during the night at the Alp@@ ing opens the night for the Wednesday of F@@ öhn through the valleys .
in the episode , the blow dryer to Thurs@@ days with bu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair@@ dr@@ yers can be en@@ cro@@ oked by the adjoining middle and the adjoining middle and in the mountains are even Or@@ kan@@ e@@ goats of over 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday in the morning rum@@ or of summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins on the alpine slope .
here rain starts an , which continues on Thursday night .
in sum , south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , with more than 100 lit@@ res of rain a square meter , this has already fallen large rain quantities in the last days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer goes down the air , in the episode rolls a K@@ alt@@ front with strong , partly heated rain from west to east through Switzerland .
along with the K@@ alt@@ front , the wind blows steady until turbulent , and the temperatures go considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square .
in the presence of President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill , were baptized in the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the protest@@ ant church in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live over centuries as a minority often only in secret to their faith .
through the square I became visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was remembered as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he took the city back then as a van@@ ishing sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions should remind him of the historians of historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther , with his theses , had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ an@@ dic church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces , the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail has written the introduction and updated the Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who now appeared in the full images .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated over 150 motives of his very personal interpre@@ tations on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can quite be quite dark .
around three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible @-@ project for which he has taken a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these include cycles , which are subject to topics such as crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity our subjects .
this makes him fascinated by several partners : that is the true of the Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ publisher with his emphasis on art books .
and here is the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ become , who dealt with the scriptures according to the scriptures .
he interpreted the &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &apos;s old Spanish Bible propositions and so is &quot; translated &quot; into current relations today . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ale mir@@ rors of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible @-@ Bible of Martin Luther and each one of the artist who put his own personal thought to the particular situation .
the jewelry @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows to double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were in the end not ever a trigger for the Bible @-@ project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ ow@@ ment .
&quot; the education already occurred with the tube , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to proc@@ laim it , so that perhaps also to dec@@ eive myself with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to as@@ certain the art in time @-@ like time again : &quot; the perception of images is today shaped by rec@@ lam@@ inate , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have another desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to leave into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work on it and feel the strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail pi@@ ped on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art has been to be &quot; I like , how he understands life with his images . &quot;
I have not respected the Bible , but which are selected for him important , also mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at an eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ mail : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained merely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from the Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to strengthen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction @-@ beginning for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , agents in charge of models : one year later almost everything was ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished .
reconciliation in politics and administration provided for treas@@ ury , above all among the residents who do not want the train to be tolerated .
so hills hat@@ ched from above , new place - now with acceptable planning and application for planning permission .
the approval will enter in October , the first community in Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is even visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former h@@ c@@ law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundesliga will make a clear sign of the weekend .
the soccer team re@@ acted to the predic@@ tive position of Germany and secur@@ es its help in coping with the problems these problems arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is nobody in the principle that no one can say , I have nothing to do with it , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest for every single one to get this issue under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or@@ hood and meet there the state of affairs in Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; then the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football can and intends to help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
the German football @-@ league will therefore extend his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues by 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some of the Bundes@@ länder will support this programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend the 36 entries will show a clear sign if they will be placed on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , wherever and as they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; -@@ newspaper ( Tuesday ) and indicated the project as a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama every day is not at stake , nobody must be taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can play football @-@ Bundesliga team , no , we must use our radiation power , our influence and our capabilities in order to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ se Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent characters of the League . &quot;
to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fications against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach presented the help of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big joint work German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 bel@@ lic@@ ences had started in their locations would have been great .
just as magnificent , small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent is being lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of huge importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs are called off the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP chief Minister lost an eye in the event of accidents
the leading role of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye for several reports by fall in early July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell after midnight on a water@@ cooler , that he carried in the left hand reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is nearly vei@@ led , he was powerless , then has tow@@ ed out to the road - that &apos;s what he told us such a week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ der &quot; SAP @-@ founder H@@ esh@@ Plat@@ ner .
meanwhile , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could leave his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet at the board of directors in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 years old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP da , fully in my job . &quot;

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you like it . &quot;

soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ uss against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes were sm@@ ashed for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of Europe &apos;s league .
the national @-@ player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga team in Du@@ el with the FR@@ P / Sky ( 7.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether the Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach let him open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden of its professionals Tu@@ ch@@ el will change its core eleven not only on the Re@@ uss position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher at the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in the future in all of the EU league games , but Tu@@ ch@@ el allowed them to be open .
with a high probability , he will also spr@@ ite the second game .
the for@@ age statement from Mit@@ o Re@@ us , that the Fin@@ als for the BV@@ B in the European League must be the target , does Mittel@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; this is not that Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government plans to act as a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be the pioneer for the change of the car in technological development , following the will of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from transport ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked about Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated driving and connected driving will increase traffic safety and make less money , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part in the G@@ 7 countries , who are also coming together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategic paper of the transport system emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band and entry to digital radio coverage .
there is currently a testing facility on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria at the time of testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risk assessments , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and where necessary to adapt to new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany seeks to settle for example internationally that the permitted maximum speed of self @-@ driving cars is raised by 10 to 130 tim@@ etres .
the German government wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car the car , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving to motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible .
nevertheless , driving cars on public roads will be expected only far after the year 2020 . &quot;
value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic @-@ police sno@@ o@@ ath Bar@@ to@@ l .
but the issue of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clearly defined .
yet the German self @-@ driving cars are skep@@ tical however - much more than French or American .
another survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the inspec@@ ting DE@@ K@@ RA will lead to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will enforce in the next ten years , 32 percent have not been considered in 20 years by now , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed said to be off by 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital , Bit@@ kom area , only seven percent would be combined to drop in control during the entire drive on all roads .
on the highway that could show at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , at the St@@ au 45 percent .
well , each Fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start with ping @-@ p@@ ong @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will start to present only in entries from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be made by September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have heard it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough even without Timo on the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was at this point in the flight to a long @-@ term planned sponsor@@ ing service in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the downside , we are no longer a clear favourite , &quot; stated single @-@ European ame@@ da Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the S@@ etz@@ als in Je@@ k@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the European 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he was also missing , and we are European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is where we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; declared World Ranking List .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ tr@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a blend of very large fashion show and a wax figures . the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) wrote an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which are visible thanks to video proj@@ ections frigh@@ tening human .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among other things was brought with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and with it he put men out of rub@@ ble .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the En@@ tr@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Citi@@ zen on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle in the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a bit of luck that the des@@ pot@@ ter has changed his beginning with@@ standing position on his personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it sounded a bit like death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already made Montreal in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that little still existent at the man &apos;s work , the fashion history , without ever completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic image for which much effort was done : to frame the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material have crossed the creators according to the stat@@ or Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution , a special delic@@ acy was done : a leather h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are hand@@ som@@ er than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also palate @-@ old Te@@ ddy is in the show to see .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Te@@ ddy Bear and clothes , she said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dis@@ car@@ ess of fashion I later joined himself later .
he saw fashion books and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers talking like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later , I bought this course but of course .
for his first own show , he could not pay the Mod@@ els .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ N@@ d
previously it went to the long embo@@ died of nitrogen in and around Pl@@ ating to make a meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered materials and spi@@ kes emerged in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example to blankets and she@@ ers .
today , this alone does not work any longer , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ b &apos;s lightning .
instead the fashion is important .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion has played a major role , was then pushed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt only calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
ever bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , which re@@ jects to past j@@ le@@ po@@ ets , an exp@@ ired order .
those who have no niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
we already do half of all orders already .
Mo@@ ik &apos;s Pl@@ auen is with nine other companies a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ y .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of sales were destroyed .
private dealers and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach the customer on this path .
the mass @-@ proof is made much cheaper in the Asian region and almost entirely sold on chains .
in addition , it weak@@ est the export , currently to Russia and to the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries to score points by environmental awareness , how Cord@@ ula Bauer has been declared by the nitrogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we are producing environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this refers to the materials used &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Diplom@@ a U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger Bran@@ ch Office of the West@@ sa@@ si@@ can School Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tops .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that must think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design may often only be slightly modified to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly developed the historical snow cover .
the machine cle@@ ars in some places little kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach - K@@ rau@@ d inspired him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ proof for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process it defines the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also supplies them to the United States , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in plac@@ ements and surroundings and would like mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
in this way I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny .
this is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economy crisis in England .

XI asks to open the economy more broadly for the world
the economy must open wider to the outside world in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping at Tuesday of a group commissioned with the reform of reform .
&quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16 session of the Central leadership group for a deepening of a comprehensive reform .
promoting new start @-@ ups and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the executive group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative listing on the regulation of market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population of the population of the population .
after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of significance , since it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a right @-@ state business environment ensures and open the market , says the statement .
the government will also ease checks on powers to the firm and make companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border co @-@ border co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of a quotation , public controlled sectors are open , more areas are open for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will provide the right@@ ful interests of foreign investments and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to request as the requirements are optimized and the application process will be facilitated .
the rights of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , have also been discussed in the meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li K@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders took part as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement after the meeting was published .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury in predat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ors and allow consumers to exploit a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which appropriate working papers for the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of false industries and environmental policy are passed on with full power of pregnant and young children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
according to the end of the food chain , Wolf@@ sch@@ midt says that the threshold values of the nerve chain for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are raised by one on two milli@@ gram quot@@ as per kil@@ os of fish .
big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are so strongly heavily bur@@ dened with Mercury , that on the basis of the existing threshold values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comparable .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the threshold values on other fishing from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
Food@@ watch recorded this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ eter@@ ies , like some car@@ p are usually so low that they already respect the planned maximum levels today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of the cl@@ amp was therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del di@@ ver maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a non @-@ toxic sword for the human being , which is deeply affected by the food chain mainly in predat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are already few amounts of especially in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the nerve system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Justice declared on his homepage with regard to current maximum @-@ values , but that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly passed through coal combustion in the environment .
the German coal @-@ fired power plants , according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Commerce to the Green Party , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year consisting of two thirds of the total amount in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of Mercury in fish is approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and universal , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted in March of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings for mer@@ cury in fish have already included the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system R@@ AS@@ FF .
