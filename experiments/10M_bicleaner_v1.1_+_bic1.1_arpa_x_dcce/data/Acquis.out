whereas , for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to granting this liberation is to the jurisdiction of the Community , which was founded upon the contract by which it has been established ;
whereas in the execution of Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention it is necessary that the European Economic Community Party may become the Convention of the Convention -
the Convention shall be entered into force for the Community on the first day of the month .
it enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day that the last of the contract parties has deposited with regard to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This add @-@ protocol has been entered into force after two years after the date of acceptance , unless one of the parties has signed an objection against his entry into force .
from that point in time , a state cannot become a party of the Convention without having to become the contracting party of the additional log .
the Secretary General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the member states of the Council of Europe , all of the United Nations Convention and the European Economic Community any acceptance or every objection in the meaning of Article 2 as well as the date of application of this auxiliary record according to Article 2 .
the Secretary General noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention .
whereas , considering that it is highly desirable when member states to support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in obtaining re@@ agents to the blood group ) ,
whereas this mutual support is possible only if the condition and use of these re@@ agents are subject to blood @-@ group@@ ing together by the Member States and shall be granted the necessary facil@@ itation and exceptions for their import .
in the sense of this convention , the expression &quot; re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group &quot; re@@ agents of human , animal , herbal and other origin for blood @-@ groups and for determination of blood @-@ intol@@ erable .
each contracting party can restrict the application of the Convention on re@@ agents of the Council of Europe under the signing of this Agreement , or to limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin for blood @-@ determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the declaration may be accepted at any time by any of the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties ple@@ dge to commit re@@ agents to the blood group at the expense of their extraction , preparation and transport , as well as if the purchase price other parties , who require their urgent need , provided that they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents of the sub@@ missions will be made available to other parties only under the condition that no profit is associated with it , that they may only be used for medicinal purposes and only be delivered by the governments involved .
any delivery of re@@ agents to the blood group @-@ determination is a certificate envisaged that they have been manufactured in accordance with the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its plant constitutes a administration agreement that may change or supplemented by the governments of the Parties of this Convention .
the parties take all necessary measures to liber@@ ate them from other Parties to the re@@ agents of all input data provided by other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances in Article 3 separate receivers quickly and on the shortest path . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties shall inform each other on the Secretary General of the Council of Europe , which is authorised for the issu@@ ance of the certificate issued in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeu@@ tical substances of human origin .
this Convention is for the Members of the Council of Europe to signature ; it may be contracting party by sign it without reservation of ratification or approval .
this Convention will enter into force one month after the day in which three members of the Council signed it under Article 7 without reservation of ratification or approval or approved or approved .
for each member that signed this Convention later without reservation of ratification or approval or it is ratified or approved , it enters into force a month after its signing or to the ratification of the ratification of the rati@@ os or author@@ isations .
after the entry into force of the Convention , the Council of the Council of Europe can invite each non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary General of the Council of Europe signed by members of the Council and the State of the Council ( a ) issued on this Convention and the names of the members who signed it or ratified without reservation of ratification or permission ;
each contracting party may terminate this agreement with respect to a period of one year by an ad to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood group @-@ determination must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , the substance or any other on the label indicated substance hom@@ olo@@ g .
if a re@@ agent is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured by getting renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the title is the recipro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um th@@ inner , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cells into the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents who are to be used on object wheels , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object bear@@ er .
the World Health Organization has established for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity at the time standards are elabor@@ ated .
a Internation@@ ales standard par@@ at contains according to definition a certain number of inter@@ national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations rot@@ ting red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ing of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution from a y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ding .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series where a microsc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood group , for the International Standard Pre@@ par@@ ations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 3@@ 01 . ) .

a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer , so shall his required properties remain at least one year long .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ es@@ sively shape according to label is a maximum of one year after the final satisfactory result test .
this on the label for dry @-@ re@@ agents is directed according to the results of the shelf @-@ tests ; it is to be found by the governmental supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of intact gas or stored in a vacuum , and indeed in the glass container , in which they have been dried and that is shut up that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent should lose at most 0.5 l of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ us oxide in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authorities can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the supplied with the dry re@@ agents supplied ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to increase the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood @-@ groups must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per lit@@ re per lit@@ re per lit@@ re ser@@ um .
re@@ agents , in@@ different if in flu@@ essi@@ ous form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor any other particle .
the possible re@@ agents for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for the blood group and should not be painted as long as possible , at least as long as not , until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for the blood group determination are in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agents resi@@ ded in a container not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the quantity required in a container must be so big that the content may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the producer @-@ room has over all production levels and controls of re@@ agents to lead to blood @-@ group@@ ed written records .
reasonable samples of all re@@ agents are kept up so long from the laboratory to keep up with some probability that the batch will no longer be used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ groups can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to reinforce the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , this re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective participation in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents are not able to contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French to attach the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , when dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required to return
in addition , this label or label on the box , where the individual containers are located , or the containers posted by the containers are given : 1 . permanent name and address of the manufacturer ,
