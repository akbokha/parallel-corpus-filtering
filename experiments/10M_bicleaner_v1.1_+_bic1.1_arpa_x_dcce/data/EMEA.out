it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt ( tablets that arise in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. cer@@ vi@@ res think and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not available ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ H @-@ I disorder , an psych@@ ic disorder , in which the patients are man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal high @-@ tuning ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe Man@@ ic episodes and prevention of serious episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the medicine .
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied to fast control of ag@@ grav@@ ated anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases the solution can be applied or the mel@@ ting pot in patients may be applied to which the swal@@ lowing of tablets are difficulty .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be dis@@ assembled , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ o pra@@ ises probably works above all as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ o pra@@ ises like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters affects the recept@@ ors to activate .
because D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in order to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ical symptoms , and their re @-@ occur will be prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re@@ occur of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in mat@@ ured anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy has been compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to avoid re @-@ perform , to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study on 3@@ 01 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered in mat@@ ured anxiety , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours compared .
in all studies the changes in symptoms experienced by the patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients referred to in treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the mel@@ ting pot and the solution to the disposable .
in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients who were Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses from 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger decrease in the symptoms un@@ treated anxiety than patients who were a placebo .
the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies of more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo over the re @-@ occur Man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo over the symptoms un@@ treated un@@ rest and were similarly effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for disposable ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ mi@@ di@@ cal disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , patho@@ gens , nau@@ sea ( mal@@ eness ) , v@@ ases , nau@@ sea ( v@@ om@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ fer@@ o@@ dity , in@@ fer@@ no ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee of Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) included that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to heavy man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke on the treatment with Ari@@ o pra@@ ises , compared to the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the result that the advantages of the inj@@ ecting solution in the rapid control of ag@@ grav@@ ated anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ os@@ e@@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to outw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 informed the European Commission of the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd. for the approval of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is recommended for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ b@@ ance and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes expressed in the treatment with Ari@@ el pra@@ ises ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day during a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficiency with dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combin@@ atory therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and Bi@@ H disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ le @-@ le dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide @-@ law behaviour belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ o pra@@ ys ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased sou@@ thern@@ most risk associated with Ari@@ el eth@@ yl@@ benzene in comparison with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ o pra@@ ises should be applied with caution in patients with well known car@@ dio diseases ( M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ in@@ sect or isch@@ ic coron@@ ary heart disease , condition disorders , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressure cutting drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less di@@ gest , there were occasional reports over during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ le dy@@ nasty .
if in one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient believes in a m@@ ns or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics must be set , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ p@@ yl@@ benzene in patients with coron@@ ary cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are related to coron@@ ary cases related to caution .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ el practice in patients with psych@@ osis patients with psych@@ osis patients had to be associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who have been treated with Ari@@ o pra@@ ises , an increased mortality rate compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving Fi@@ x@@ er Dos@@ age , a significant relationship between the dosage and the anus for unwanted torn events with Ari@@ o pra@@ ises treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with c@@ eto@@ acia or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who have been treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active ingredients , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related inci@@ dents with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic active agents treated to be direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ le to the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ o pra@@ ys in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines will be taken with re@@ br@@ acing side effects as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ o@@ ti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the reset rate of Ari@@ el pra@@ ises , whereby this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy promot@@ ers increased a high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C von Ari@@ pi@@ le to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ er@@ ern , the joint use with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors can result from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
if you consider the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks for the patient .
other highly @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ ein@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
after inser@@ tion of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors should be raised the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to the dosage level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ an@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the arias - concentr@@ ations calculated .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ ht@@ ar per day have no significant effect on the metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ gen ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patient should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ el pra@@ ys .
due to the insufficient data base for security during the human being and due to the concerns about the reproduction of reproduction , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits jus@@ ti@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , in other anti@@ psycho@@ tic patients , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including fuel vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ o pra@@ ises have no negative influence on it .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than placebo or were considered as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled @-@ scale study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who have been treated with Ari@@ el pra@@ ises , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ j@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ le @-@ le treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients who have been treated with Ari@@ o pra@@ ises , and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under o@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy .

in a different study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients with Ari@@ j@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ ance - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients with placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters revealed not a medi@@ cally significant differences .
enhancements of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ace ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ o pra@@ ises patients , compared to 2.9 % of patients with placebo .
among the side effects which can occur in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and above their appearance also in the treatment with Ari@@ el pra@@ ises , Sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and coron@@ ary cases , unwanted inci@@ dents and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch have been un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ o pra@@ ys only for adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a tick @-@ enco@@ ded in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ el pra@@ ises ; it is unlikely , however , that hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis is used in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ le presents a high plasma cutting .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ j@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene in Sch@@ iz@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ H @-@ disorder regarding the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ le in comparison to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial was 52 of the share of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients , who held a response to the study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ le 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement @-@ scales , which were defined as secondary study @-@ destinations , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , anti @-@ depress@@ ants , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of the resi@@ dual rate was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ le @-@ group and at 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational twin @-@ blind study in schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary Studi@@ enzi@@ o &apos; weight gain &apos; was found at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of minimum 5 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ H @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ kes showed a opposite placebo over 3 weeks in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with Fi@@ x@@ er Dos@@ age with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ H @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ kes compared to placebo in@@ accurate effectiveness .
in two placebo and active mono@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ H @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ kes showed a opposite placebo over week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition Ari@@ o pra@@ ises also showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .

in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe dis@@ courage , a similar effectiveness has been observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z could be found due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed arias ( oral ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psycho@@ tic symptoms .

in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ le to placebo over a stabil@@ isation phase in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in preventing a back into the Man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ pi@@ le AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection . 90 % larger the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations .
in 2 studies involving healthy subjects the mean time until reaching the maximum plastic wrap from 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ o pra@@ ises inj@@ ecting solution was well tolerated by R@@ atten and monkeys and as a result in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeti@@ tive gift at a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular systems .

based on conventional studies with arias ( oral ) to safety har@@ mac@@ eu@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gener@@ osity , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ less x@@ icity , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to the can@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any special dangers to the human being .
very significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or Ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects introduced a dos@@ is@@ al gland @-@ toxicity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ pigment and / or par@@ ench@@ ant cell exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) and an increase by secondary mortality rate ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold of the mid@@ die dose @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a chol@@ era base was established as a result of the exhau@@ st of sul@@ ph@@ ur c@@ ites of hydro@@ xy@@ gen , from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended max@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of abra@@ sion has been studied in a major study , attended by 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received an anth@@ racycl@@ ines about three quarters before .
the effects of abra@@ sion ( in all@@ ets or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el using a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse effects ) .
overall speaking in the main Study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with my@@ stic patients to the treatment at 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one only considers the patients who were treated for the first time in case of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines and drugs in relation to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
against the other hand , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Er@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who are silent or prior to the beginning of the treatment low neut@@ ron @-@ phil@@ atel@@ ic figures in the blood .
the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ sion in patients whose initial treatment was no more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that unlike other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules , which promotes the assemb@@ ling of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by in@@ hibition of their dep@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ent network that is essential to the vital inter@@ phase and the tac@@ tical cellular functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ber convey@@ s Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis from plasma components into endo@@ th@@ elin cells and within @-@ vit@@ ro studies have been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ers promotes the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells .
it is assumed that this enhanced tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ ept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic Rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of my@@ op@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ kar@@ zin@@ om is supported by the data of 106 patients in two @-@ bed non @-@ verbal studies and from 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients were treated with metastatic Mam@@ cardi@@ ac with metastatic Mam@@ bo , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ kar@@ kar@@ om .
this multi@@ centr@@ alised study was performed in patients with metastatic Mam@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with em@@ bedding for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ ale met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and the adjuv@@ ant treatment .

the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or turn@@ table connection of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sion with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) as after a solvent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Er@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue samples is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily attributed to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was signed by administration as an injection in a V@@ ene within the framework of a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients , which caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference medium .
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene inj@@ ected before they were re@@ amed to or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ aries between the beginning of the study and the opening period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin have been investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ aries were provided by patients suffering from se@@ amed , in the same measure as in those patients , which still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a little traum@@ atic hip break@@ age as in the hin@@ dered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus pa@@ get to take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip pre@@ fecture should receive a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting by injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in zom@@ eta , became a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta on the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and it was examined by the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures for a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years that have recently suffered a hip correction ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies with a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that is based in the blood ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output .
in the study with older women the risk of mal@@ frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced to 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those of placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip correction , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a appear within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a risk of kidney , reactions to the in@@ fusion station and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clarification material for doctors ready to apply the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the medicines to apply , as well as similar material for patients , in which the medication side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

patients who were classified as Res@@ p@@ onder on the end of six months ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the post@@ operative study , the therapeutic approach could be maintained at 141 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ a , treated with a middle duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes lasting In@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of customs acid at 64 patients acquired the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently .
after that , the plastic pipe quickly took up on &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid disappearance of the large circulation of half @-@ time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ hour 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with an termin@@ ology time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above and ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h you find 39 to 16 % of the administered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ clearing is independently of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes lead to decrease the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic substances is unlikely , because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not yet met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed while they are a f@@ aint or not a direct and / or irrever@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the credit @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was under 64 examined patients on average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this arises that an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney failure to down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing until 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
as for heavy kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are possible for this population , no statements are possible .
acute toxicity The highest non @-@ commercial intraven@@ ous single dose amoun@@ ted to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in trials in dogs , individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chron@@ ological toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application were determined in intervals of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ minute in@@ fusion which amounts to approximately 15 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ mal of the human therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeti@@ tive application in cum@@ ulated exposure , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure sufficiently exceeded the tox@@ ic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common lack of studies with repeated application was a multip@@ licity of long bones in the met@@ aphy@@ se of long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a report which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ corro@@ sive effect of substance .
at rats we watched a ter@@ ato@@ con@@ ity at dos@@ ages from 0.@@ 2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxicity were pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of degra@@ dation Ser@@ um @-@ calcium level .

Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub @-@ class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the garlic .
decreasing blood levels of the sex hormones , above all est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone construction is done too fast , and new bone material is im@@ printed out of what makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by norm@@ alized the bone building , thereby causing a normal bone formation , thereby giving strength to the bones again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo any dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff , if you take other medicines / to apply or have recently been taken / applied , even if it is not prescription pharmaceuticals .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which they are damaging the kidneys .
when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , together with foods and beverages you worry that you may take sufficient fluid according to the instructions of your doctor before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to make two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered to you by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need a further dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed , join with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public the present document is a summary of the European Public Security Reporting Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is explained how the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) has been analysed , in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a dioc@@ es@@ medi@@ drug ) can not be applied . • It can be applied together with another de@@ mining drug ( du@@ ck therapy ) .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or ins@@ ulin may be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos @-@ treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ i har@@ ness or isl@@ anders can be reduced .
this means that the body @-@ physical ins@@ ulin is better to be enhanced and the blood sugar is reduced , allowing for type 2 @-@ diabetes to be better set .
with more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ ic acid , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible that the blood sugar has lo@@ wered when applying the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of the extra G@@ abe of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants showed in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra G@@ abe resulted from placebo to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined by 2@@ 89 patients who were investig@@ ating Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who were additionally placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist ( decreased sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other ingredients , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ales ( high ket@@ one level - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos are intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 launched the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permit permission for the integration of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , curved and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar has been inadequate and are in@@ compatible with ins@@ ulin due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
currently using Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age are not available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ash , particularly those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ms are observed if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
an cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ an illness was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) , or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver damages are to be checked as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms developed to refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ nia , fatigue , ap@@ peti@@ tiveness and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , the liver levels are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be directed by the preliminary parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been proven to stir in fat deposits , and in some cases linked to hydr@@ ation of hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a ha@@ zel , the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on came a minor reduction of the middle hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ds ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensi@@ tiveness lays in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple treatment therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch has been reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a appearance or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ca@@ de@@ ms with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , but de@@ pressing physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ca@@ de@@ ms , when patients report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of noti@@ fications of announcements from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires occurred with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ tions per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients were treated with a comparative medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see Section 4.@@ 6 ) .
studies for investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on that decreases in pregnancy , hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the mat@@ ernal and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fo@@ etus growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the re@@ fraction of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the standard range often appear on how to placebo , however more rarely than in comparison with met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ ic acid .
in a Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis disease , the incidence of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was below 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
since the launch has been reported rarely about heart in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it became a summary analysis of announcements from random@@ ised events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative @-@ medi@@ ated groups .
during a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) which were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ sper@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensi@@ tiveness of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ m in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy a blood@@ sugar ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate despite three @-@ month optimisation phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - worth 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients , which continue to only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant removal of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ o@@ ti@@ cker compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks for inspection of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and of free fatty acids , and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as little bit , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ ols .
in comparison to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while in met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both over an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , an cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ ular condition in bat@@ ches which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the leading con@@ centr@@ ation of the un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not exercise any relevant effect on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

according to oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in human beings , the marker was found mainly in the fo@@ e ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the medium plasma @-@ elimination half @-@ time period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy proportions , but also resem@@ ble the or@@ ates of the or@@ ical Clear@@ ance of the native substance .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration of plasma magnific@@ ation with ha@@ modi@@ fying her@@ edi@@ tary , an@@ a@@ emia and irrever@@ sible ec@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ishes the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the mat@@ ernal and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fo@@ etus growth .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane has been employed in total 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can produce no ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin effectively .
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane has led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ y , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced to with another human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ans may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may impact blood sugar ( the full list is the package fee ) .
the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ aph@@ an in the treatment of diabetes compared to risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission distributed Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S granted approval for the integration of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane within the European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ecting needle must be suspended under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly due to intensified ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast real , bi@@ ph@@ any , long @-@ active ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin an@@ alo@@ gon ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin origin ) can cause that a change in dosage is required .
if switching to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient can be a dosage adjustment , these can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients whose hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal into human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is less pronounced or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
prior to travelling , taking over several periods of time , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals are applied at other times or must be taken .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and to consult his patients with other medicines .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id must not be used in patients who might be very sensitive to ins@@ ulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may impact blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S granted approval for the integration of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , first the amount of ins@@ ulin must be raised up , then the amount of the long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin .
3 If in the switch to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient can be a dosage adjustment , these can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
prior to travelling , taking over several periods of time , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals are applied at other times or must be taken .

if the ur@@ inary bricks lie after two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ites , the dose may be increased once daily 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , still tox@@ ics can occur ; therefore patients may be advised , at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic or further medicines for preventing greed .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to that of a placebo ( hypo@@ the@@ drug ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary bricks in the blood has over the last three measurements below 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 2@@ 62 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily use 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and on none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal liver levels .
especially in patients with coron@@ ary heart disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary tract in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ tic leu@@ ka@@ emia , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present Gi@@ cht@@ k@@ not@@ ing and / or a tox@@ ins ) .
if the ser@@ um @-@ so@@ p stand after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety has not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people are not experienced in children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .

as with other har@@ n@@ sec@@ ular drugs , it can occur during the treatment start to become a acute case , because by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ b@@ ular pi@@ le , initially can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver infections Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 were observed slight conclusions of the liver li@@ vable in patients with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated in patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore advised to perform before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical report a liver work test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ was no exchange studies carried out to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line of the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abolic inhibit@@ or was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) .

there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of percentage of ser@@ um acid @-@ acid concentration by proxy , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) .
primary End@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid @-@ con@@ centr@@ ation ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of data collected in the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um sec@@ ular bricks refers to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) that needed less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ love ) .
this was also associated with a reduction in the g@@ inal junction , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the plaster mark up to month 24 .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk exists for a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid an irrit@@ ation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take up until after the first food intake of the day , which shall take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D sp@@ y .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who have been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who exclusively posts Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data in front of the data contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , exactly the dose which is required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscle , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ dens@@ ation ( sli@@ ps ) , con@@ dens@@ ation ( slip belly ) as well as acid @-@ encounter .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or taking medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following hints are to be followed just to reduce the risk of solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not break the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , since a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a consists of . • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day , which shall take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding , or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal in@@ al@@ trakt , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .

the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that should be pointed to possible solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out to the occurrence of men@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ulating so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy @-@ shar@@ pen@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or to point it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage transfers to the patient will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no elevated risk was established , were rarely ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe , and associated with complications , reports ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the inser@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a ortho@@ tic surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ta of the j@@ aw .
clinical assessment of the treating doctor is binding for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted to take them during the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their om@@ iting .
you should not take two tablets on the same day but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned at the intended week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acid and some oral drugs can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age when they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines , without that clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for applying post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore does not apply to nursing women during pregnancy .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaging effects in regard to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

in phase III studies entered the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % at the spinal column , 5,@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7,@@ 8 % on the trou@@ gh .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at group , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ir@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo @-@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffered , one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year @-@ pro@@ long@@ ation of these studies the targets of the BM@@ D of spine and comfort continued to remain ; the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ales and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ure controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ow@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg once daily have been taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily G@@ abe of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least a new vor@@ tex in by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.2 % compared to placebo : 0 % ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption based on intraven@@ ous reference dosage was the mean bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night @-@ proof fasting and two hours before taking a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability took accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
at common pro@@ ban@@ den led the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) to any clin@@ ically important change of oral bio@@ availability ( increase in funding in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have sur@@ rendered that Al@@ end@@ ow@@ age is temporarily spread over the bones from 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bones or divor@@ ced with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous gain of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have been around 50 % of the radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with the urine , and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fur .
according to intraven@@ ous gain of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearing from Al@@ end@@ ir@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance were not yet 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is eliminated with rats not over the su@@ re or al@@ gebra@@ ic transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not thought that it affects the elimination of other medicines through this transport systems .

cre@@ tion In the gift of radio@@ active vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy ban@@ kers was the medium ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the bow after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , who is not exp@@ ired in the bones , will soon be deposited over the urine .
although no clinical data are provided on this , it is therefore expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ow@@ at as in animal testing also will be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function to expect an increased g@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in bones ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ oc@@ raf is administered from patients to prevent a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent a bla@@ sting of transplan@@ ts by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously made studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ s@@ in was compared .
main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the tran@@ spl@@ ant has been cr@@ ashed after a treatment duration of one year ( by taking for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more studies have been carried out at 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and examined , such as Adv@@ oc@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

in patients with et@@ ten@@ ant hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ id antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components may not be applied to advance .
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Adv@@ oc@@ raf because the Adv@@ oc@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should be able to classi@@ fy this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should be made only under the tigh@@ ter control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in a consequence of an conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ oc@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in individual cases and blood @-@ ordin@@ ances ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot;
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ oc@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us t@@ mirror should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as the mirror of the mirror , with both formulations , both at kidney and in le@@ ased patients .
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure to the immediate post @-@ graf@@ ting phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ance can can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition allows no oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment is intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application for the suppression of tran@@ spl@@ its must be maintained . consequently , the immune system must not be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - Ni@@ er@@ le@@ tation prevention , proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ tat@@ too therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as day daily g@@ abe in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later because the phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the tran@@ spl@@ ant operation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant advance therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily spouse on the morning .
dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ oc@@ raf must have to be converted by Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at a once daily intake of Adv@@ oc@@ raf . thus , this change@@ over has changed in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a shift from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants at Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily must start treatment with each one in Ni@@ er@@ - and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ant When adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ oc@@ raf is an oral initi@@ atory of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ its had no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , armor and col@@ on transplan@@ ts patients , occurred in a oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal graf@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day to apply .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function to maintain blood tal@@ low in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a her@@ b@@ tion of dose necessary .
patients with reduced kidney function because the kidney function has no influence on the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ic potenti@@ alities of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serv@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ ine levels , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ fer@@ ment and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ance raf In the switch from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations regarding the mirror mirror in the full blu@@ ff@@ t The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in the individual case of state @-@ of @-@ bloo@@ ded tactics of full @-@ bloo@@ dies@@ t @-@ level control controls .
it is recommended to conduct frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ oc@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ full blood @-@ concentration , ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ oc@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the mirror mirror in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the talent mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blu@@ ff@@ ing in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ant usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with t@@ anned patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the hypo@@ the@@ tical treatment of liver , kidney and cardi@@ o@@ graf@@ ts were usually used blood concentr@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe unwanted inci@@ dents , including tran@@ spl@@ its rep@@ ul@@ sions or other side @-@ effects , which can occur in a row by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or Over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should be made only under the tigh@@ ter control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 On the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which turned out to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ upp@@ res@@ upp@@ res@@ upp@@ oses , are not yet a clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation for adult cardi@@ o@@ graf@@ ts and tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ makers in the Kin@@ des@@ age are not yet a clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a down@@ time of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing red cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant species can be avoided during a treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations charged in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subjected to such circumstances significant variations .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , was described as Car@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y , or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ici@@ encies , are an already existing cardi@@ ac suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid supply and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or ul@@ tra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by appropriate clothes or use of a sun prot@@ ector by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who occupy Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for Pr@@ es like head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g ) .

simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or reduce .
it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels can change in the con@@ vocation of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equ@@ il@@ ess concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

Adv@@ ance is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one due to the lack of factor VIII conditional , inn@@ ate blood disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application act as if Adv@@ ance is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or to prevent blood operations in surgical interventions .
patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ance is similar to another in the European Union approved medicines called Re@@ ph@@ ate , but it is made differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined by prevention of ble@@ eding and in surgical interventions .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ance was evaluated in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ sep@@ tics with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively with &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ ache , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
an Adv@@ oc@@ ate may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to approve the Adv@@ ance of Adv@@ ance in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based upon the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ tical events , the factor VIII activity is intended not under the specified plasma bricks ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is above .
during the treatment process , the intake of the inj@@ ections and the frequency of inj@@ ections is to be an appropriate determination of the VIII @-@ plastic bags .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis of proph@@ yla@@ xis of blood vessels in patients with severe H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A shall be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be reached or if the blood pressure is not dominated by a reasonable dose , a test must be performed , in order to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be weigh@@ ed .
the delivery speed should be directed after the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ cognitive activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relation with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ positioning stage at the biggest is and of genetic and other factors depends .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ nest@@ y known inhibit@@ ors development was observed , after converting from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occur of ( low @-@ tri@@ umph@@ ant ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare appearance of the H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A in women lie on the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the inhibit@@ ors of the patients &quot; largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which all occurred in previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk of education of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and Sch@@ win@@ del ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( thereof 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not ob@@ tainable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated by the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) calculation . b ) The unexpected waste of the blood cl@@ ash factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els joined post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post @-@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
the blood mind was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low in@@ sect with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE ( 2,@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da @-@ approach ) .
in addition , with no one of 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII v. 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) is a F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or .
with previously un@@ treated patients of an ongoing clinical trial formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed through the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant increase as well as an ongoing peak of anti @-@ oxid@@ ation against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell proteins , otherwise they did not have any signs or symptoms that were on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes reported in several repeti@@ tive production positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE was reported on an allergic reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ aphy@@ l@@ ak@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activation factor VIII appears as a co@@ efficient factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of critical factor X from factor X .
all phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were carried out on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of the factor VIII @-@ activity &lt; 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over @-@ study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in the table below .

based on the data available since the initial use of the data , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefits risk @-@ risk assessment , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore the CH@@ MP is based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the eligi@@ bility in 5 years should apply for another reference procedure .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited hosted the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its request for approval for the In@@ corporation of Adv@@ ance for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surrounds and rel@@ ies ) of it .
this is a kind of virus that gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ oc@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ Scan &quot; that has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger any infections in humans .
Adv@@ oc@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the canc@@ er@@ ous cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the non @-@ broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is broken , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company submitted data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP answers the answers of the company to the questions asked were still un@@ solved .
based on the examination of initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
after view of the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings advantages for the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine by means of the body , the type of administration , and the security of the medication .
in addition , the company had not been sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ance can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company won the CH@@ MP not about whether the withdrawal consequences for patients has currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ oc@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other slowly will be released over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will be applied to treating the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hypo@@ cris@@ y , by an allergy to pol@@ len prot@@ ru@@ ined inflammation of the nose @-@ paths ) in patients with nas@@ al sm@@ al swelling ( du@@ sty nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is to be taken twice a day , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( du@@ sty nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes of the heav@@ eg@@ ra@@ des of the hypo@@ the@@ u@@ pf@@ ymp@@ tom@@ ome that were reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients received their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours .
when contempl@@ ating all h@@ ay con@@ ges@@ tion the patients reported Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of symptoms at 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze a relief of symptoms at 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ti@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic ( Nich@@ lau@@ re@@ ation ) , sl@@ um , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( appetite ) , con@@ ges@@ tion , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , sleep @-@ dys@@ functions and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not to be applied .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a Eng@@ angle glau@@ coma ( higher intra@@ oc@@ ular pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ dis@@ osis ( over@@ vol@@ ati@@ ble@@ eding stroke ) or had a risk for a hem@@ or@@ ical stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to approve the launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is contrary to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to be sm@@ ashed , to break or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied due to the lack of data to invali@@ dity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not used for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use duration on 10 days because in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time .
after decrease the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper brea@@ ths , treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ in@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Er@@ go@@ ka@@ it@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combin@@ atory therapy were not examined for this patient collective and the data are not enough to utter@@ ance relevant recommendations on the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and the data are not enough to utter@@ ance relevant recommendations on the dosage .
patients must be informed about the treatment at appearance of a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or by Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( like head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ ache ) must be abol@@ ished .
in the treatment of the following patient groups will be taken care of : • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia are patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ ts in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Blas@@ en@@ hal@@ so@@ b@@ stru@@ ction or bron@@ chi@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to de@@ generate a minimum of 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka can prevent other positive reactions to indicators for door@@ ways or reduce to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma @-@ concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
during the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there could be no significant differences between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients with placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
this has not yet been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsi@@ bly , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ c@@ ist .
the invali@@ dity of the application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ ory properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it may come to a work@@ per , which may result in a impair@@ ment or ability to use machines .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circul@@ atory collagen ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor ) with possible let@@ tering processes .

a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation is particularly probable in children , as well as A@@ tro@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pe@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ op@@ ic cy@@ to@@ ds like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mastering cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ duction of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells .
for a single dose @-@ study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg have no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flu@@ idity of the fluid or the tasks connected with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg was found daily no higher frequency of beats compared to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further symp@@ athetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal .
it participated in 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets received .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall concept for the symptom ( except nas@@ al sm@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than below a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decl@@ ining effect , determined by the nose @-@ out swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in the seasonal allergy rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of the p@@ add@@ les , the amount of sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
there were further studies submitted to prove that the body is sy@@ rup to sy@@ rup , the solution to the inser@@ tion and the mel@@ ting pot in the same way , as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % with the patients received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symptom after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
January 2001 shared the European Commission of SP Europe for the approval of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mit@@ er and Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness when applying des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be made according to the previous disease progression and may be res@@ umed after the end of symptoms and may be res@@ umed when re @-@ occur .
in the Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ gen period a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets not stated in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced at the same intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it may come to ben@@ per , which may result in a impair@@ ment or ability to use machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most commonly applied side effects , reported on the more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect head@@ ache , which occurred with 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ generation study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) were not clin@@ ically relevant effects .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ op@@ ic cy@@ to@@ ds like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mastering cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ duction of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ on molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on En@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple professionals , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day over 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically phar@@ ma study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg per day ( the Ne@@ un@@ ary of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself .
for a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg have no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flu@@ idity of the fluid or the tasks connected with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and Per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified according to the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the complete cor@@ es of freight in the quality of life at Rhino jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished through the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ating for further forms of ur@@ ti@@ sh@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ physiological ology of the e@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be margin@@ alized more easily .
since the hi@@ st@@ am@@ in@@ mates are a fundamental factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria also results in other forms of ur@@ ism to an improvement in symptoms ; this is corro@@ bor@@ ated by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of size and number of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was the minority of the patients who do not re@@ acted to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka from the study .
an improvement of the balance by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and of the wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmaceutical study study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ population , was achieved with 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant Cum@@ ulation after once a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , this has not yet been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsi@@ bly , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ c@@ ist .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg made meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) do not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials performed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed at a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quanti@@ t@@ ational differences with regard to the toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gener@@ osity , genital toxicity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ alism , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no special haz@@ ards to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mit@@ er and Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available , which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es you should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ burden ( see section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ing@@ in children from 2 to 11 years of age that are restricted , is identical to those with children who have normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glu@@ cose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ in@@ ox in@@ suff@@ lation of this medicine should not take hold of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed in the framework of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not stated in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced with simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like with a placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dosage 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ phase dosage study on adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) were not clin@@ ically relevant effects .
children aged 1 to 11 years , which came into question for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2,5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be ex@@ iled in adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple disabilities in adults and adolescents , used in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day over 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ ary of clinical dosage ) was applied for ten days in adults showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
in controlled clinical trials , recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and teenagers have no increased incidence of beats compared to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg carried out A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies not impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults occur due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol , neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol in@@ duced performance or even to an increase in pun@@ ctu@@ ality .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the complete cor@@ es of freight in the quality of life at Rhino jun@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effectively performed by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tik@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of size and number of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otyp@@ e was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ phase study with sy@@ up@@ form@@ ulating on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with an termin@@ ous half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient to once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially reli@@ eved that the company takes its request for approval for the inf@@ low of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly for protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 des influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ a , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ tion emerges , which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after administration of the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine being called &quot; physical virus &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a flu virus that Stam@@ ms quickly .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti @-@ solids &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes human body as physical ) , un@@ ri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this resulted from the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA for preventive vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment please contact your treated doctor .
for more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are causing the acquired immune virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is causing the acquired immune disease ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , axi@@ al is not available as a solution to inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
axi@@ ase should only be en@@ umer@@ ated if the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has given that the virus will appeal to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ ase according to body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines that keeps HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at low levels .
to do not cure AIDS , however , may delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of HIV related infections and disorders .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adult , which had previously been treated with prot@@ esters numbers .
this compared with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken in 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously been previously prot@@ esters , compared with other prot@@ esters .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of patients with non @-@ proven concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ al last ) or the change of Vir@@ al last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ esters previously , they had for 48 weeks under A@@ esthe@@ tic more patients an Vir@@ al last under 400 copies / ml as below placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in the case of children reduced , A@@ gener@@ ase has also been the Vir@@ us@@ last but by the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ esters , only very few of the treatment .
in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ esters had been treated , the Vir@@ us@@ last for 16 @-@ week treatment was just as effective as other prot@@ esters :
in patients with HIV , which was resist@@ ed against four other prot@@ esters , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ esters previously :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 a@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
axi@@ ase may also not be used in patients suffering from cur@@ rants ( an herbal supplement to treat depression ) or drugs , which are just as such as ather@@ os@@ ase and are harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines against HIV , amongst patients suffering de@@ gener@@ als , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ass ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which will be caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) included that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r but the Committee presented that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ esters , have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , limited information is limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 launched the European Commission of Gla@@ xo Group Limited by means of a permit for the integration of A@@ generative in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ esters ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
for usually aspir@@ ated capsules to pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r will be administered along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % less than from Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r than a capsule ; therefore , axi@@ al capsules and solution can not be inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ ated capsules is 600 mg of am@@ met@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If axi@@ al capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addi@@ tive of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to axi@@ om ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ ated capsules is 20 mg of am@@ met@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines that should not be exceeded daily ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ esters have been studied in children .
A@@ ging is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to invali@@ dity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dose to a@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is supposed to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate li@@ ke@@ ying with caution , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ ging must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that axi@@ al or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ als does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ esthe@@ tic capsules are to be applied with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral com@@ bi therapy , have an elevated risk for heavy liver interactions with potentially deadly course .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please refer to the related informations of these drugs .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including a chron@@ ically @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , which over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not advised , unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic mi@@ tig@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ sore and Supp@@ ression of the secondary function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors and sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , are methods of determining the substance concentration .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ esthe@@ tic may be less effective because of reduced plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing bricks of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if even lower doses can be administered from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of a toxicity due to the high pro@@ stitution of the axi@@ al solution of the axi@@ al solution to the inser@@ tion , this formulation is contra@@ sted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients .
axi@@ al should be dropped on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or are involved in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including demonstr@@ ators , has been reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ k@@ emia or an Ex@@ az@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related met@@ abolic disorders .
at h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ esters numbers , reports on an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hooks .
in case of HIV infected patients with heavy immun@@ def@@ ective patients may develop an inflammat@@ ory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ae@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass @-@ index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ta in particular in patients with advanced HIV illness and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeu@@ tical width ast@@ o@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated for increased plasma bricks with grav@@ ating and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r causes that lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance of resistance .
by trying to equi@@ p the lowest plasma bricks by a dosage increase of other prot@@ on@@ ess inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently unwanted effects observed in the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already involved in cur@@ rants , the Am@@ anni@@ hil@@ ation levels and , if possible to review the Vir@@ al last and cur@@ ate the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max to 30 % lower , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r was applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that occupy the effectiveness and irrever@@ sibility of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % humili@@ ated if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was achieved during the combination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) combined with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended however a narrow monitoring , since the effectiveness and irrever@@ sibility of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic trial used to apply A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the imagin@@ ative component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least an hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da down@@ stairs ) .
therefore , during the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ esters would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ viral ap@@ in to other prot@@ ections and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ viral ap@@ in the ser@@ um @-@ concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r possibly lowers .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic bar .
when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , since a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma @-@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 193 % and thus a rise of associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ine associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster the ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ ase , will get to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
Phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but could be the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing bricks of both medicines will be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with a@@ gener@@ ase , may result in interactions .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ehol@@ der@@ mer it is advisable that ant@@ acid is not taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase since it can come to res@@ or@@ p@@ ulation .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ulsion , which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plastic bags of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium block , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Š@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ dic@@ pin , Nic@@ ot@@ o@@ pin , Ni@@ ge@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 through Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , whereby possibly the activity and toxicity of these drugs will be increased .
the simultaneous intake with inhibit@@ or can increase their plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations in connection with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhibit@@ ors in relation of side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ting and pri@@ ori@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) ampli@@ fy .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic ( 4 times daily ) , whereas the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of axi@@ om with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with this glu@@ co@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic mi@@ tig@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ frac@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 are pronounced enhancements of plastic bags in simultaneous administration of ather@@ cases .
because plasma cutting resistance from these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ frac@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines with am@@ met@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended for frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations as far as to stabili@@ zation the mirror , since the plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the same time of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , axi@@ al must not be applied together with oral in@@ ag@@ gregate Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution is advisable .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ ent@@ alem Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ esters inhibit@@ ors on a possible increase in the plastic bars of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered along with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if even lower doses can be administered from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given , such as the Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to adjust when Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
while the gift of war@@ far@@ es or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with an over@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a mi@@ tigation or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ em@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predicted , therefore also alternative methods of conception is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the use of a@@ gener@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful breakdown of potential usage for the mother compared with the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the milk @-@ activated R@@ atten , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known if Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is over@@ stepping into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ production study on lam@@ inated rats , which was administered by em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight in order .
the further development of the offspring including fertili@@ zation and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the invali@@ dity of a@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the effects associated with the a@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and led to the treatment of treatment .
many of these events cannot be clari@@ fied whether in connection with the intake of a@@ gener@@ a or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ esters were not previously treated patients 1200 mg of o@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) published by the investig@@ ator doctors as linked to the study drug and were performed at more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment performed surgery ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ un@@ ne@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ y of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ k@@ aler fat collection ( stal@@ ks ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ spective , non @-@ treated persons , which had been treated with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium term of 36 weeks , was observed only ( stal@@ ks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , more than 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different NGOs over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin attacks were usually slightly up to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ ku@@ y@@ pap@@ ul@@ fs nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment to be broken with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ta were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV illness or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV infected patients with heavy immun@@ def@@ ective patients may develop an inflammat@@ ory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined in both acute and chron@@ ically infected cell line ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in periph@@ eral blood @-@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Gener@@ ating concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is located in the range 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in human beings is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ spective , un@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ants - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ spective , not previously treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r got twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure to be tested up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ e analysis of the ins@@ ulators of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic predi@@ ctions within the 59 were included , with prot@@ agonist non @-@ treated patients occurred , showed resistance pattern which were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) at with prot@@ esters pres@@ um@@ ated patients occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ esters @-@ mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ e @-@ based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ e interpre@@ tations such can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ esters @-@ resistant ins@@ ulates .

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended always to attract the current interpre@@ tations to the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
attributable to phenomenal resistance @-@ based analyses Klin@@ cally vali@@ ant interpre@@ ting systems can be applied in connection with the gen@@ otyp@@ e data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with prot@@ esters @-@ resistant ins@@ ulates .
companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenomenal Cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated pattern creates a certain cros@@ resist@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ s@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally received .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ esters for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spective , non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sag@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ esters @-@ resistant ins@@ ulators ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that can impact on the following treatment effects .
the cover of the effectiveness of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) either with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ gling ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , primarily associated with low @-@ do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ thre@@ es@@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with a weigh@@ ted virus @-@ sensitivity to a@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least an NR@@ TI have been included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ submission of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ statement shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of uns@@ ur@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies as@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r given at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the patients received with a@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the included patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output .
19 Basi@@ cs to these data should be considered in treatment optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children who are expected to be considered to be expected from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ru@@ gged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max to 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % off of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ disp@@ ens@@ ed Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ class Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosage inter@@ dependence during the dosage inter@@ dependence in the ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hi@@ ate or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered if they are given simultaneously with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r exposure to adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , axi@@ al solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low in the elimination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ bic@@ avi@@ r plasma cutting is comparable to those that can be achieved on healthy prob@@ es after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the c@@ low@@ ity with am@@ bic@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cellular Aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2,@@ 0 ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , according to twice daily doses of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cellular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
in the present exposure data of people , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ c and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , the bacterial inv@@ ests in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ atic test on human periph@@ eral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
these liver toxicity can be supervised and proven in clinical daily life through measurement of AS@@ T , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us .
until now in clinical studies no significant liver toxicity in patients have been observed , neither during the administration of ather@@ oma still at the end of the treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , who have been treated with an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both at the control and with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
with a systemic plasma exposure , which lay significantly under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure among human beings , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ self @-@ ong@@ ation and s@@ low skel@@ eton , which refer to a delayed development .
24 The o@@ gener@@ ase capsules shall be applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ths ) , higher doses must be applied to axi@@ om ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ ated capsules is 20 mg of am@@ met@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines that should not be exceeded daily ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is supposed to be treated with caution in patients with in@@ vig@@ il@@ ant or mild liver trouble , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , are methods of determining the substance concentration .
axi@@ al should be dropped on duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or are involved in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and associated with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r causes that lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance of resistance .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max to 30 % lower , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was achieved during the combination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) combined with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended however a narrow monitoring , since the effectiveness and irrever@@ sibility of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ esters would be low .
when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , since a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster the ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ gener@@ ase , will get to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium block , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , xen@@ o@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ dic@@ pin , Nic@@ ot@@ o@@ pin , Ni@@ ge@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , whereby possibly the activity and toxicity of these drugs will be increased .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plastic ( 4 times daily ) , whereas the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
while the gift of war@@ far@@ es or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with an over@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a mi@@ tigation or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ em@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ at 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine may only be applied after child@@ ren@@ ation of potential usage for the mother compared with the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction study of the lam@@ ented rats which was administered by em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the invali@@ dity of a@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined in both acute and chron@@ ically infected cell line ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood @-@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Gener@@ ating concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r is located in the range 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ esters @-@ resistant ins@@ ulators ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the treatment performed with PI pre @-@ treated children expected to be considered to be expected from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invisible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ class Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosage inter@@ dependence during the dosage inter@@ dependence in the ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hi@@ ate or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered if they are given simultaneously with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected ; therefore , the effect of a kidney failure to the elimination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
in long @-@ term studies for the c@@ low@@ n@@ ity with am@@ bic@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cellular Aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2,@@ 0 ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily doses of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
in the present exposure data of people , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ c and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , the bacterial inv@@ ests in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ atic test on human periph@@ eral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , who have been treated with an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both at the control and with Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r .
these results can be close that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abolic paths not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
generic solution for inser@@ tion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ esters ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ e was not occupied with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .

the application sti@@ ff@@ ness and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depends on the treating illness : • At the case of F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dara is to be applied for six weeks five times weekly . • At the case of two four @-@ week treatment cycles , during four weeks break between the cycles of treatment , three weeks weekly .
the cream is thin before bed@@ time di@@ pped up on the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain enough for long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete absorption of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ ins cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara also was tested in two studies on a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ins .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • When handling war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate was combined with placebo treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % with the patients infected with placebo treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ch ) .

local hood actions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions are formed after the completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary because of the complaints of the patient or due to sever@@ ity of local hood actions , a treatment course may be made of several days .
the clinical results of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently no data is available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment should be considered super@@ vis@@ ous bas@@ ins or other appropriate therapy forms .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not lie clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors .

I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the data available via the acute ker@@ at@@ ose on the sub @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local tre@@ ads appear frequently , but these reactions tend to take back in the course of therapy or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
when the local path@@ ways to the patient cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment can be exposed to a few days .
the data of an open clinical study suggests that patients with more than 8 A@@ K@@ - lesi@@ ons have a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cre@@ am should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

in the study mainly the security of the medicine was examined , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating its effects in regard to reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine and regarding the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine for about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the li@@ mbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ esteem , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may occur in patients who may possibly react very sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be updated every year , all new information that may possibly be known , check and update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who are Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 informed the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. the approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ ly α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who possesses the experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver suff@@ er@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as each in connection with side @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be supervised even closer , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ plac@@ ements are immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , expected to form almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because little experience is due to res@@ ump@@ tion the treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after a interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ fung@@ al ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and par@@ acet@@ ate / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion , in which the reaction occurred to be res@@ umed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ le is made .
animal experimental studies do not allow to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that have been expon@@ entially over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to not satisfy during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were derived mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drugs in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , moreover severe reactions to , including Bron@@ vi@@ pass@@ ana , breathing and facial ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children inv@@ itations drugs in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with overwhel@@ m@@ ingly severe delay form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table below .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with the patients aged under 5 years of age with a heavy exp@@ ir@@ ation ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days at patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature payout of the study ) cuts in 13 / 45 patients not by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ modi@@ fying ag@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say pro@@ voc@@ able antibodies before , including 3 patients , where it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with lack of low @-@ anti@@ body mirror reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG sp@@ y in the resin , while in patients with high antibodies to as@@ certain a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the resin .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 @-@ 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal and minor neutral effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ tics activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to not imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the resin .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be in connection with the incidence of und@@ es@@ irable medicine actions , even though the occurrence of unwanted medication actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the acute sub@@ strate and the prevention of another accumulation of formal restoration of the enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ le is quickly removed from the circul@@ atory and absorbed by cells into the l@@ ak@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the entire disease spectrum reported was the majority of patients from the average phen@@ otyp@@ e and only one patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ ci@@ zed explicit volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters to walk .
the primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the pre@@ matur@@ ely FE@@ V and the absolute wal@@ k@@ way in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treatment to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the o@@ conduc@@ tivity that is shown in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period of time and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was fixed , which remained consistent until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease balance between the patients , which summar@@ izes through the use of a combined final version ( to the expected percentage of AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was undertaken a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients , which were dated at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy cl@@ amp form and 4 with the middle chamber ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg .
in several patients was a size growth ( s = 7 ) and a weight gain ( s = 3 ) and a weight gain ( s = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the average flow rate ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average flow rate ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with average delay form had limited only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ genic dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ metering schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test were performed .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , represent a viable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to patients with older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemical agents , as a sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should take in treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta administered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti @-@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid lack of prevention ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or occur in which certain other side effects should occur , the treatment should be charged , or reduce the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active shape goes more easily in canc@@ er@@ ous cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of medication by means of a longer lifetime in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ an A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study at 4@@ 56 patients who previously did not receive chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ wise lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who have been treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived average 12.5 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months when all administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.5 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients whose cancer does not attack the record epith@@ eli@@ um cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer over@@ life than with the comparison drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the approval of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any stretching back must be en@@ rolled out with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .

during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate and intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage and after every third ir@@ - hand cycle .
in patients suffering from P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created a full blood image prior to every gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mb@@ a .

at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage examination must take place under the tre@@ ati@@ fication of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity enhance level 3 ( except for neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ Z@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient the value prior to treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be cancelled , if in patients after 2 tin @-@ reduction , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - due to the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies have given no indication that in patients aged 65 years old , or in comparison to patients aged 65 years , an elevated risk of employment exists .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age based on non @-@ sufficient data to invali@@ dity and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary that go beyond the dosage recommended dose for all patients .
the data base for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients were examined with a liver @-@ functioning of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ edge of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Bor@@ value and / or Tran@@ sam@@ h values of &gt; to the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver hep@@ atitis ) , not specifically examined in the studies .
patients must not be monitored with regard to the but@@ ton@@ ic mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alization number is again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ pod speed has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ ron @-@ number , Th@@ ro@@ pod speed and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity such as neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ lin@@ t@@ si@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was s@@ worn when a pre @-@ treatment had taken place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 .
therefore all patients must be instru@@ cted to be treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for reduction treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid medicines ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is fores@@ een , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s have to avoid treatment for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid supply - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the ergometer in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be weigh@@ ed .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ ts , and cereb@@ ral calendar events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of the atten@@ u@@ ary circumstances ( except yel@@ lowing @-@ fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irrever@@ sible shafts is di@@ pl@@ ated by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the treatment advance to obtain advice regarding the sperm production .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid medicines ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of a multip@@ occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses can be applied by N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , with a long semi @-@ term potential like Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ano@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the illness and the possibility of inter@@ dependen@@ cies between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , if the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in sw@@ ang@@ ers , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ in@@ ites are expected to be expected in pregnancy severe birth @-@ def@@ ective .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after thorough completion of the utility for the mother and of the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of a irrever@@ sible damage occurs through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the course of the treatment , consult with regard to the sperm count .

the primary analysis of this study was done in the population of all patients who were investig@@ ating the test medication ( random@@ ized and treated in the treatment arm ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ an was shown in the use of the Lun@@ a@@ gen@@ n@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ a- T@@ in @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .

alli is for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass @-@ index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ ched nutrition .
alli must not be applied by children and young people under 18 because not enough data on efficacy and safety .
however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ged , is necessary in elders and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .

the probability of appearance of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when alli is taken along with a fat @-@ fat or fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes with an improved met@@ abolic control can be accompanied , patients who take a medicine against diabetes , prior to starting a therapy with alli , a doctor or a pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients , the alli as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol levels take account , should their doctor or pharmac@@ ist ask if the dosage of these drugs must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional oscill@@ ating measures to prevent the possible contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible predi@@ ctions of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions between medicines and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a sen@@ ing of the Cic@@ los@@ s@@ in @-@ plastic bar .
for the use of war@@ far@@ es or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ ate , the Quick @-@ Valu@@ es could be influenced ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients , which were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standard area remained .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a complement to the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of an Ein@@ mal@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of volunteers , who received at the same time at Or@@ list@@ at , a reduced decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .

the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of medicine by means of the absorption of bi@@ ased gre@@ ase is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not ob@@ tainable ) .
the frequency of well @-@ known side effects which were found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of in@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli gains with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects may result .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi@@ ples of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight pro@@ ban@@ ces without significant clinical trials .
in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side @-@ effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , can be derived from a rapid revers@@ ing of systemic effect that are due to the Leban@@ ese qualities of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect pres@@ upp@@ oses in the lum@@ ens of the ma@@ gen and the upper intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente bonds to the active ser@@ ene @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ e and pan @-@ static li@@ festyles .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those individuals who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the maximum weight loss came up in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall cholester@@ ol@@ d amoun@@ ted to 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,@@ 8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average modification of the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3,@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the most common side effects depend on the effects of capsules together and thereby arise that more fat is eliminated from the body .
these side effects will usually appear within the first weeks of the treatment course , since you might not yet reduce the fat share in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise the nutritional supplements , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ ched nutrition . • Get more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and about the size of portions that you usually take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that you are going to over@@ see your fat . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat or ev@@ enly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat , which you may take for each meal , not to take them then in the form of a fat @-@ sufficient main meal or a trained neigh@@ bor to take on how you might occur in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these companions can occur , learn these with the time to control their diet .
• medicines for children in@@ accessible . • You may not apply alli after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified in order to protect the content from humidity . • The bottle contains two white sealed vessels with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is applied at chem@@ o@@ therapy , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chem@@ o@@ therapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amid , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ ic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group did not appear enough information .
this means that the active substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies received , which are strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , in which 24 hours after chemotherapy was not om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron &apos;s patients ( 126 out of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron the values of 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 established the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd. for approval by Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ cted : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer disease and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induc@@ ing through a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding one prior to the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on @-@ pi@@ on@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ ling ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , however caution is advisable for the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
except in connection with a further chemical therapeu@@ tics , alo@@ xi is to not be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in prehistoric studies hem@@ med Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not in@@ hibit the activity of the five examined chemical therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amid , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady qui@@ z concentration , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ inhibit@@ ors ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies do not lie , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is deemed necessary by the treating doctor than necessary .
in clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly with alo@@ xi related to , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of survival actions and reactions to the deadline ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies showed themselves from unwanted events as in the other d@@ osing groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , there is probably no effective therapy with an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blin@@ ded studies have received a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which had a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ate and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , which was given to day 1 without de@@ x@@ eth@@ as@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , with patients who were given 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ ym@@ eri@@ zation involved and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe performs a slow elimination of the plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations on a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ous half @-@ time period of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma @-@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) are generally proportional to the whole dosage range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous generation of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations forth , that once a daily intraven@@ ous generation of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ended in 3 consecutive days reached overall tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value , however , the C@@ max after the introduction of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and roughly another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic ites which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on met@@ abolic process have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent that I@@ so@@ enz@@ me C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 have participated in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been recovered about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ev , the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
though , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , the termin@@ ale elim@@ inations and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is however not justified .
in pre@@ clinical trials effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to clinical use .
10 From the pre@@ clinical trials , references that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ en@@ channels which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the lifetime memory lifetime .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose expressed in about the 30@@ th of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) that were given every day over two years , resulted in a more multip@@ ly frequency of liver tum@@ ours , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , pan@@ ni@@ al mark and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and da Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results as for the human being is very low .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the predi@@ ction of approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C / ml inj@@ ecting solution was recommended .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same phar@@ ma @-@ efficient component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Frame &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ standing ) hep@@ atitis C ( one through a viral infection ) .
with a microsc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue is indicated , moreover , the values of the liver enzy@@ me Alan@@ in@@ - Amin@@ o ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data prior to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medication by means of efficacy , safety and effectiveness in hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hep@@ atitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 consisting of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the preparation of the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug must not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after hi@@ ring the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients than in the reference medium ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the assessment methodology included in the study was to determine what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) does not vali@@ date sufficient vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with Kru@@ sten@@ ance @-@ related skin infection ) and small infected la@@ fic@@ s ( R@@ iss@@ - or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden ) , sl@@ itting and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections , or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ ac@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go against these types of infections may not affect these types of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied with patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient speaks not to the treatment two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial reef ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby hem@@ med the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was rec@@ eded after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo were applied to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ onia showed similar contact persons , when the results of both studies were gathered together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups attached to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity ( failed ca@@ vities in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , or probably due to MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the contractor .
the Committee of Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during the short @-@ scale treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections over the risks are exagger@@ ating : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected little Laz@@ er@@ ations , slo@@ gans or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission adopted the Gla@@ xo Group Company Ltd. for approval in the entire European Union .
patients with which within two or three days no bet@@ tering shows , should be investigated once and be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of an awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment broke off , the o@@ be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will commence .
retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is intended to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant st@@ ac@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no bet@@ tering or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which has been reached by humans for topical application on shi@@ ped skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin p@@ be on a me@@ ager skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be kept required when topical retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re @-@ production @-@ toxicity according to oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the fo@@ etus / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the stit@@ uting has continued / ended or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go continues / ended , between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ants and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most common reported side @-@ effect on the agreement , which looked about 1 % of the patient .
active ingredient Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ate of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us passive se@@ ck@@ ery ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us passive se@@ ck@@ ery ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain bonds of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ gen@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bonds of the Bosnian protein L@@ 3 involve and lies in the region of the ri@@ gen@@ om@@ al P @-@ bonds and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ al centre .
by attachment to this binding station hem@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al under@@ tak@@ ings .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of the resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin may appear in at least some infection forms , should be pursued through expert advice .
there were no differences in in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ aur@@ ens , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ reference to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ olo@@ v@@ Valent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and applied to gir@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma map@@ le were won .
the sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic shot at the person after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ab@@ dic@@ ated skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP &apos;s in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human lives micro@@ summer has been pri@@ mor@@ ed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , among the reduced participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral toxicity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed more than 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there were neither male nor female rats at or@@ ical dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus achieving a up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 ab@@ dic@@ ated skin :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of two doses existing vaccine , whereby protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine can be brought to an end for two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is required against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hep@@ atitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it may be against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and since 1997 approved the vaccine Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vaccines will be used for protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered into a vaccine administered by three cans .
because Ambi@@ rix contain rix and Twin@@ rix adults , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of protected antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had a similar gap between the inj@@ ections and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , ap@@ peti@@ tions , pain on the inj@@ ecting location , redness , Mat@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) do not apply .
August 2002 , the European Commission distributed the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . inter alia , a permit for the in@@ duction of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose dates back to date and the second dose administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ co@@ worker is desired for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combination of combin@@ able .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis @-@ A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ antibodies are in the same scale as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not yet entirely backed whether immun@@ o@@ ous individuals who have addressed on a hep@@ atitis vaccine as a protection , since it may also be protected by im@@ measurable antibodies possibly by the immune memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ections for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gross of vaccine , adequate opportunities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the Com@@ bin@@ ation@@ ary recommendation , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface .
in here@@ tic patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , after the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation , there is no adequate anti @-@ nat@@ al and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ body , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration might lead to a sub@@ optimum refle@@ ctive success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
at Th@@ ro@@ sy@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or ble@@ eding disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected in sub@@ trac@@ ted sub@@ stitution as it can occur in these cases by in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular gift of blood .
if Ambi@@ rix had been administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective need to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vacc@@ in@@ ants of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , Mat@@ ernity , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ery and preser@@ vatives .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccination ambitions have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ doses compres@@ sor .
only exceptions were the higher prevalence of ache and matrix on a basis of calculation per vaccination , but not on a basis basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % at the proportion of a dose of 3 @-@ cans compression .
after the complete vaccine @-@ cycle reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix had received , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % with the subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age compres@@ sor .
the incidence of mat@@ ernity was however comparable per pro@@ s@@ ag ( i.e. over the whole vaccine at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix were compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the prob@@ es which received the 3 @-@ cans combin@@ ation@@ . ) .
the frequency of pre@@ defined pain and mat was low and comparable that was observed after the filing of the Com@@ bin@@ ation@@ ary acc@@ ept@@ . it has been observed with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccine , the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ence class was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface .
at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix had a common appearance of pain ( on the inj@@ ecting location ) per dose , not reported per pro@@ s@@ l .
the percentage of vaccines that were reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis @-@ B@@ - surface @-@ surface , was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical studies that were performed at influenza in the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 given dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 given dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ation@@ si@@ can with three cans .
at the 2@@ 89 individuals whose immune homo@@ gene@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age im@@ p were significantly higher than with ambitions .
the immune response that were reached in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface .
for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that , made after vaccination by 3 doses with a combination of combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activation hep@@ atitis hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml was determined .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme is to be compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine .
if the first dose ambitions in the second year at the same time coinci@@ de with the re@@ fres@@ her mi@@ tigation , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les vaccine vaccine was sufficient , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
an clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar to similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ek@@ ee@@ - and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the remains of an eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in through waste water @-@ poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms which may make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely from infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B viruses , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child are infected with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B viruses before the administration of both vaccination @-@ and hep@@ atitis B viruses ( although you / your child feel un@@ ease or sick ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections , which cause the liver damaging or symptoms which are similar to those after a Hepatitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ative skin attacks , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have already performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the submission of the second vaccination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced sal@@ ary of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated carbon @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced content to effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and may give you a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle tissues . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened with your child due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child can pull out a tick bite .
Ambi@@ rix cannot be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on the vaccine can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction is to the vaccine .

but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
when another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as many li@@ mbs at the same time .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not administered or breast@@ feeding women , except it is urgent that it is vacc@@ inated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown a allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without the need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has been known since issuing the first approval for the market entry , the CH@@ MP considers that the benefit @-@ risk @-@ relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in traffic from a Member State ( the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security dates are limited to this medicine due to the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzy@@ me def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ moni@@ ous bovine spongiform encephalopath@@ y in the pre @-@ history .
am@@ mon@@ k is divided - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed under food or via a gast@@ ro@@ cha@@ z ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a Nasen@@ son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or with placebo ( a head@@ quarter drug , i.e. without any substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appetite loss , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , irrit@@ ability , ab@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , rash , im@@ puri@@ fying , rash , or weight gain .
the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps was effective in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ium levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the illness at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indic@@ ative in all patients where a complete enzy@@ me is already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , who mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) there is an indication for use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephalopath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually according to the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with an body weight over 20 kg as well as for high @-@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from a earliest lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ chi@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ ir@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ syn@@ th@@ at@@ ase deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered by patients with sip disorders , since a risk exists for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
any tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with so@@ dium and dem@@ nific@@ ation of clinical conditions only with caution .
as met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate takes place over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied with patients with liver or kidney failure solely with extreme caution .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gener@@ osity of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young ra@@ cks in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came into a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal recovery and to become an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nervous system in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noticed whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate retired in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the l@@ ac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients occurred at least an und@@ es@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old ab@@ om@@ ax patient who developed a met@@ abolic disease in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ de , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Pan@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred with a 5 month old small child with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ sh@@ limiting neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection that is controlled by acet@@ one with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine , which is deposited over the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ omas ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle may be thought to be produced for each gram so@@ ulated mon@@ oso@@ dium but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment immediately is started to improve survival chances and the clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of early mani@@ f@@ ests form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in newborn period was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led even when dealing with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cky free analogue within the first year of life to death .
through Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilisation of alternative paths of nitrogen @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , so@@ dium and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival @-@ rate new@@ bor@@ rowed at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first period of life ) diagnosed diseases on 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ mish encephalopath@@ y , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ ests form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ chi@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ mish encephalopath@@ y and then were permanently treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is contaminated in liver and kidney enzymes with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine is created .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and of its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by virtue of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium bis@@ phen@@ yl and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after indi@@ ces as well as repeti@@ tive gifts from oral cans of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disease was also examined with cancer patients after intraven@@ ous generation of so@@ dium but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ alen single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form were established 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ osis or ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after night @-@ consuming fire was not phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
for three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ actic acid concentration in plasma tiles on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gate of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us @-@ testing , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with with toxic and non toxic doses treated non @-@ sto@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h for oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who are not able to swal@@ low no tablets or patients with difficulty disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ cha@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al son@@ ic .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with an body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ ein@@ y in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from a earliest lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ chi@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ ir@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes had been exposed to phen@@ yl@@ actic at ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 year old ab@@ om@@ ax patient who developed a met@@ abolic disease in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ de , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Pan@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ omas ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ ment of surplus value
on the basis of investigations about the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle may be thought to be produced for each gram so@@ ulated mon@@ oso@@ dium but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an or@@ alen single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were established 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability the patient can preserve the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on 0.@@ 95 g , the average measurement of 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to get the medication on a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , specific liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cky waste products that accum@@ ulate after consuming proteins in the body , not divor@@ ce .
if at your laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription pharmaceuticals .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS because the medicine could move into the breast @-@ milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases were also confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , indul@@ gence of hearing , Des@@ cent , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states .
if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency take of your hospital in order to start the appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox will be applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood vessels to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ in@@ far@@ ts ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ti@@ bility in the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or EC@@ G ) .
becomes An@@ gi@@ ox on preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
approximate 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effects of angi@@ ox at all @-@ types or in connection with a gly@@ ca@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
while PCI was frequently used to patients a stand ( a short tube , that remains in the ar@@ tery , to prevent a closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS An@@ gi@@ ox , with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , cardi@@ ac accidents or Rev@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as the traditional treatment .
in patients suffering from one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as he@@ as@@ in , except for severe ble@@ eding , with which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other stag @-@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who have recently had a blood @-@ blood , as well as with people with severe hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or a disease infection .
the Committee for Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a removable replacement for he@@ aters .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd was granted approval for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ mid@@ - ST @-@ mid@@ line ) ) with an emergency handle or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous decrease of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is done in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced inc@@ iner@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ster of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a initi@@ ating intraven@@ ous compound of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a deal immediately following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us @-@ G@@ abe are not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on under 225 seconds , a second bul@@ b of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and dil@@ uted the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second bul@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT will examine 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney injury , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , the ACT lay 5 minutes after gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an@@ ox @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous generation of un@@ question@@ able s@@ ine or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous heat of lower heat treatment .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance , or other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active blood circulation or elevated blood risk disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ sist@@ ence bacterial En@@ do@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal is administered in combination with another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though in case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ding , most ble@@ eding may occur at arter@@ ial points of points , patients who undergo a per@@ sec@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ tery ( PCI ) while treating principle anywhere ble@@ eding .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal , should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal treatment should be achieved before the treatment of existing levels .
starting from knowledge about the efficacy mechanism of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ at , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ ot@@ zy@@ g@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances increase the blood pressure .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal , with Th@@ ro@@ sy@@ cy@@ c@@ ations or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly monitored on a regular basis .
the animal @-@ experimental studies are in relation to the effect on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , which is inadequate or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either in@@ demand army in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal group as well as in the diseases treated with s@@ being treated in patients with patients over 65 years more frequently than und@@ es@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
serious ble@@ eding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y and TI@@ MI above for heavy ble@@ eding , as defined in the foot@@ er of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal , alone significantly less often than in groups with He@@ at plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ validation , plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events : in@@ traction , retro@@ mental ble@@ eding , or blood circulation in a point of point , which a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention required of ≥ 4 g / d@@ l with a known blood@@ stream , re@@ operation due to blood pressure , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations that appeared in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ spec@@ it@@ one@@ al , hospitable , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects may be based on data from a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients using one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal group as well as in the diseases treated with s@@ being treated in patients as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than und@@ es@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy blood changes occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the comparative @-@ group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above have been reported after an extensive use in practice and are summarized in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ inal treatment is to be removed immediately and the patient to monitor with regard to signs of blood .
An@@ gi@@ ox includes Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the anim@@ on@@ en@@ bind@@ ings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the li@@ aison of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on the one hand re@@ generates the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a permanent in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to the control of glu@@ cose ra@@ ils ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin may not work effectively .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very little from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter lifetime is considered a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin cannot be effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.1 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra , compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal @-@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin an@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood @-@ glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ atar Deutschland GmbH for approval for the transport of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdom@@ inal cloth , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal cloth .
due to the decreased glu@@ cose capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin installation , the ins@@ ulin may be put down in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( origin ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , n@@ PH , galvan@@ ization etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin demand .
3 A inadequate dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another inc@@ ur type or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be under strict physician supervision and may make a change in dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the efficacy profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change in the switch of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase blood sugar and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting @-@ enzy@@ me ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ tin , mono@@ gam@@ e@@ yll@@ ab@@ yll@@ able , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ s , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics like Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ regulation be shi@@ ped or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ produc@@ tion@@ alism showed no differences between In@@ su@@ e@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embryonic development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ ose enters into the human breast milk , but in general ins@@ ulin occurs neither into the mother &apos;s milk , nor becomes it res@@ or@@ ated after or@@ ting application .
below are the clinical trials known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system sub@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their appearance ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the availability information is not hidden ) .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated by means of an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ant person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
after a glow object the patient should be monitored in a hospital to as@@ certain the Ur@@ - thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral glu@@ cose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be made by In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ br@@ man@@ em Reg@@ ins@@ ulin .

In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast impact , such as norm@@ ality human@@ ins@@ ulin , and achieves the complete glu@@ cose effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
the data was obvious that in an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal tim@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
