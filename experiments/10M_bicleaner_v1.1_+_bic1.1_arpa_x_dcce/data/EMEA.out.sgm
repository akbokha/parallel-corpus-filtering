<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Security Reporting Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) has assessed to recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package fee (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt (tablets that arise in the mouth), as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. cervires think and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not available), mistrust and madness; • BiH-I disorder, an psychic disorder, in which the patients are manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe Manic episodes and prevention of serious episodes in patients who have addressed in the past on the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is applied to fast control of aggravated anxiety or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases the solution can be applied or the melting pot in patients may be applied to which the swallowing of tablets are difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be disassembled, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ario praises probably works above all as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Ario praises like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than neurotransmitters affects the receptors to activate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in order to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manical symptoms, and their re-occur will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, the reoccur of symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in matured anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been compared to 347 patients with Halopidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to avoid re-perform, to 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered in matured anxiety, with which by Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours compared.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the changes in symptoms experienced by the patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients referred to in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting pot and the solution to the disposable.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injecting solution showed patients who were Abilify in doses from 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger decrease in the symptoms untreated anxiety than patients who were a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">The application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term studies of more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo over the re-occur Manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo over the symptoms untreated unrest and were similarly effective like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for disposable (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyrmidical disorders (uncontrollable), pathogens, nausea (maleness), vases, nausea (vomation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, inferodity, inferno (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee of Human pharma (CHMP) included that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes spoke on the treatment with Ario praises, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injecting solution in the rapid control of aggravated anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in BioseI disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 informed the European Commission of the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the approval of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is recommended for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bibance and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes expressed in the treatment with Ariel praises (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day during a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficiency with dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combinatory therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and BiH disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdosis should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripile-le dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide-law behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Ario prays (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased southernmost risk associated with Ariel ethylbenzene in comparison with other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ario praises should be applied with caution in patients with well known cardio diseases (Myokardinfarinsect or ischic coronary heart disease, condition disorders, hypovolaemia, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood-pressure cutting drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spatidyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less digest, there were occasional reports over during the treatment with Aripipelzole dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in one with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dynasty should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient believes in a mns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be set, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripylbenzene in patients with coronary cases in the anamnese or at states that are related to coronary cases related to caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Ariel practice in patients with psychosis patients with psychosis patients had to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who have been treated with Ario praises, an increased mortality rate compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study involving Fixer Dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the anus for unwanted torn events with Ario praises treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with cetoacia or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who have been treated with atypical antipsychotic active ingredients, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment of hyperglycaemia-related incidents with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic active agents treated to be direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripile to the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Ario prays in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines will be taken with rebracing side effects as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric blocker, reduces the reset rate of Ariel praises, whereby this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy promoters increased a high-effective CYP2D6-Ininhibitor (Chinidin) the AUC von Aripile to 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly-effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor ") Metabolisierern, the joint use with high-effective inhibitors can result from CYP3A4 in higher plasma-concentrations compared to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should predominate the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-proteinors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After insertion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors should be raised the dosage of ABILIFY to the dosage level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escanopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the arias - concentrations calculated.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripihtar per day have no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omegen) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ariel prays.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for security during the human being and due to the concerns about the reproduction of reproduction, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotic patients, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including fuel vehicles, until they are certain that Ario praises have no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) on than placebo or were considered as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled-scale study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who have been treated with Ariel praises, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyjinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Halopidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was treated in patients with Aripile-le treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients who have been treated with Ario praises, and 15,1% in patients under olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Biosi-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripil treatment - treatment and 53.3% in patients under Halopidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In a different study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients with Arijethylbenzene treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiquance - treatment and 15.7% for patients with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patients groups under Aripiethylbenzene and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters revealed not a medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the CPK (Kreatin-Phospace), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of the patients treated with Ario praises patients, compared to 2.9% of patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects which can occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and above their appearance also in the treatment with Ariel praises, Spatidyskinesis and coronary cases, unwanted incidents and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch have been unintentional or intentional overdose with Ario prays only for adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a tick-encoded in the treatment of overdose with Ariel praises; it is unlikely, however, that hemialysis is used in the treatment of overdose because Aripile presents a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Arijethylbenzene in Schizophrenia and BiH-disorder regarding the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ario praises showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor and 5HT2a - to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrenergen and to the Histamine-H1Receiver.</seg>
<seg id="76">With gift of Ariel holl in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks on healthy subjects, the Positcrowns-Emissions-tomography showed a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripile in comparison to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Halopidol-controlled trial was 52 of the share of the Responder patients, who held a response to the study medication, in both groups (Aripile 77% and Halopidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement-scales, which were defined as secondary study-destinations, including PANSS and the Montgomery, anti-depressants, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Halopidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of the residual rate was found at 34% in the Aripile-group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational twin-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary Studienzio 'weight gain' was found at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of minimum 5 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with an manic or mixed episode of the BiH-I disorder, Aripikes showed a opposite placebo over 3 weeks in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with Fixer Dosage with patients with an manic or mixed episode of the BiH-I-disorder showed Aripikes compared to placebo inaccurate effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monootherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with an manic or mixed episode of a BiH-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripikes showed a opposite placebo over week 3 and a lasting effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Halopidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition Ario praises also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of mania, such as lithium or Halopidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with an manic or mixed episode of a BiH-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly mirror over 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy in therapeutic Serumbers, revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks, followed by a long-time extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripile to placebo over a stabilisation phase in view of the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in preventing a back into the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydride and hydroxyprofiling of Aripile-drums, the N-Dealkydy is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elliptical half-minute is approximate approximately 75 hours for Ario praises with more extensively metabolites on CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisierors via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Ario praises there are no differences in the Pharmakokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well showed themselves in a pharmacoinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no more gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A particular-specific evaluation of the Pharmakokinetics yielded no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the Pharmakokinetics of Ariel prays.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic properties of Ario praises and Dehydro-arias were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose-study by proxy-cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function to the pharma function of the class C, which consists only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repetitive generosity, reproduction, reproductionalism, genotoxicity and to the canogenic potential, the preclinical data could not recognize any special dangers to the human being.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only with dosages or excpositions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have limited for clinical use only limited or no meaning.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects introduced a dosisal gland-toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-pigment and / or Parenchant cell dosage (AUC) at the recommended maxaldosis in humans) and an increase by side-kidney cancer (AUC) with female rats and female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the central steady State) (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholera base was determined as a result of the exhaust of sulphur cites of hydroxycyle in the Gall of monkey from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16- to 81times the recommended maxaldosis in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, those in the human Gall have found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripietle not more than 6% of concentrations found in the study about 39 weeks in the Gall of apes, and lie far below the bordervalues (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages which resulted in expositions of 3 and 11ely the mid steady-State AUC in the recommended clinical maxaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg risedronat once daily during 2 months was shown in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">During the combined results, a similar withdrawal of pain and pain management was observed in comparison to the output value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder on the end of six months (on the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronat treated patients who participated in the postoperative study, the therapeutic approach could be maintained at 141 with Aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedrona, treated with a middle duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One unique and multi-time 5 and 15 minutes lasting Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of customs acid at 64 patients acquired the following pharmacoinetic data which proved to be dosisindependently.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plastic pipe quickly took up on &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid disappearance of the large circulation of half-time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ hour 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with an terminology time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above and ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretion of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h you find 39 to 16% of the administered dose in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall body-clearing is independently of the dose of 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains uninfluenced by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes lead to decrease the Zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmakonzentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of by Cytochrom P450-Enzymatic substances is unlikely, because Zoledronic acid is not yet metabolized while they are a faint or not a direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronc acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the credit-in-Clearance, and was under 64 examined patients on average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This arises that an easy (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney failure to down to a creatinin clearing until 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Zoledronic acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for heavy kidney failure (Kreatin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are possible for this population, no statements are possible.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-commercial intravenous single dose amounted to mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials in dogs, individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure) administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronological toxicity in studies with intravenous application were determined in intervals of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-minute infusion which amounts to approximately 15 mg / kg, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7mal of the human therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repetitive application in cumulated exposure, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure sufficiently exceeded the toxicological effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common lack of studies with repeated application was a multiplicity of long bones in the metaphyse of long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a report which reflects the pharmacological, anti-corrosive effect of substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats we watched a teratoconity at dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public the present document is a summary of the European Public Security Reporting Report (EPAR) which is explained how the Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) has been analysed, in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type-2-diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diocesmedidrug) can not be applied. • It can be applied together with another demining drug (duck therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylharnants or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylharnants or insulin may be maintained at the beginning of the Actos-treatment, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfoni harness or islanders can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-physical insulin is better to be enhanced and the blood sugar is reduced, allowing for type 2-diabetes to be better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonic acid, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible that the blood sugar has lowered when applying the dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study the effect of the extra Gabe of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylharnants showed in a lowering of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the extra Gabe resulted from placebo to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined by 289 patients who were investigating Actos in addition to insulin, a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who were additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesiologist (decreased sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who might be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazon or one of the other ingredients, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketoaziales (high ketone level - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos are intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 launched the European Commission of Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited permit permission for the integration of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, curved and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other hand the title "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar has been inadequate and are incompatible with insulin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">Currently using Pioglitazon for patients under 18 years of age are not available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart disease or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or eyelash, particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and odems are observed if pioglitazon is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">An cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovasculan illness was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of the liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range), or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased up to 3-times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver damages are to be checked as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms developed to refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomnia, fatigue, appetitiveness and / or darker harn, the liver levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazon should be directed by the preliminary parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, a dosisdependent weight gain has been proven to stir in fat deposits, and in some cases linked to hydration of hydration.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hazel, the therapy with pioglitazon came a minor reduction of the middle hemostbinds (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.4%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of the hemoglobin by 3-4%) and to a lower extent also in patients under Sulfonylharnants and insulin (relative reduction of the hemoglobins by 1-2% and the hematocrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitiveness lays in patients, the pioglitazon as oral or triple treatment therapy with insulin, the risk of dosisdependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch has been reported under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including pioglitazon, on a appearance or deterioration of a diabetic macular decadems with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of Makulaödemen, but depressing physicians should be aware of the possibility of a macular decadems, when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of notifications of announcements from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the women of pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study about 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events, questionnaires occurred with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Frations per 100 patient-years) in patients were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is canceled (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the Pharmakokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment of pioglitazon that decreases in pregnancy, hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance to the maternal and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the foetus growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (out of this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turmoors and the refraction of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon the three-fold of the upper limit of the standard range often appear on how to placebo, however more rarely than in comparison with metformin or sulfonic acid.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovasculosis disease, the incidence of a severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazon was below 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch has been reported rarely about heart insufficiency under Pioglitazon, however, when pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summary analysis of announcements from randomised events in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative-mediated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, questionnaires occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%) which were treated with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on a activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome Prosperator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)) which leads to an increased insulin sensitiveness of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazon reduces the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosm in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as Monotherapy was continued over two years to examine the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy a bloodsugar (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebocontrolled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate despite three-month optimisation phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c - worth 0.45%, compared to the patients, which continue to only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pioglitazon treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant removal of the Albumin / Kreatinin Quoticker compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks for inspection of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and of free fatty acids, and a rise in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as little bit, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterols.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, under Pioglitazon was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while in metformin and gliclazide diminished values observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postpdial increased triglyceride levels, this both over an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, an cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomised with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascularular condition in batches which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, whereby the leading concentration of the unchanging pioglitazon is usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV contributes to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interactionstudies could be proven that Pioglitazone could not exercise any relevant effect on the Pharmakokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Ininhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) or reduces the plasma-concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive pioglitazon in human beings, the marker was found mainly in the foe (55%) and a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The medium plasma-elimination half-time period of unchanging pioglitazon amounts to people 5-6 hours, and the total active Metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma-concentrations of pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy proportions, but also resemble the orates of the orical Clearance of the native substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration of plasma magnification with hamodifying hereditary, anaemia and irreversible echypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon which diminishes the hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance to the maternal and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the foetus growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were inducing during the rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal-model of the family-based polyposis (FAP) the treatment performed with two other Thiazolition indicators to an increased frequency of colonization.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "30" and on the other hand the title "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the women of pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study about 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events, questionnaires occurred with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Frations per 100 patient-years) in patients were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each of Pioglitazon or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant removal of the Albumin / Kreatinin Quoticker compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postpdial increased triglyceride levels, this both over an effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic Trygomerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to their primary final point, stroke, acute coryokardinfarts, stroke, acute coryoarization and Revvascularization and Revaskularisation of leg-arteries, put the results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with the intake of Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "45" and on the other hand the title "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of notifications of announcements from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with pioglitazon and received over 7,400 patients that showed a higher incidence of bone loss in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study about 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events, questionnaires occurred with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Frations per 100 patient-years) in patients were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="866">Actraphane has led to a decrease in the HbA1c spy, which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced to with another humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who might be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphans may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may impact blood sugar (the full list is the package fee).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of acetaphan in the treatment of diabetes compared to risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission distributed Novo Nordisk A / S granted approval for the integration of Actraphane within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injecting needle must be suspended under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly due to intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycaemia symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast real, biphany, long-active insulin, insulin or insulin analogon) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA against insulin origin) can cause that a change in dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If switching to Actraphane in the patient can be a dosage adjustment, these can be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients whose hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change of animal into human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia is less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling, taking over several periods of time, the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor, as such trips can lead to that insulin and meals are applied at other times or must be taken.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and to consult his patients with other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycaemia which can occur in a non-controlled trial therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycaemia can lead to awareness and / or coronary cases and with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system occasionally - peripheral neuropathy A rapid increase of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with a corrupt improvement in blood sugar, however, can be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Disorders of the skin and the hauled web site occasionally - Lipodystrophy An der injecting location may arise an lipodystrophy if failed to change the chestal inside the injecting area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and conditions on initial conditions occasionally - Local Oversensitivity reaction at the injecting location During the insulin therapy can occur local oversensitive actions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematom at the injecting location).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system occasionally - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions of generalizingly, itating, witting, gastrointestinal disturbances, respiratory disorders, low blood pressure and impotence, low blood pressure and impotence.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can be gradually developed: • Lighting hypoglycemic can be treated by the oral state of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics therefore should always have trauma pieces, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice in themselves. • Heavy hypoglycaemia is treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven associate or by glucose which intravenously been given by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the active max will be reached within 2 to 8 hours, and the entire lifetime is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorpancy profile is due to the fact that this product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A series of governance (hydrolyse-) places were taken into consideration; none of them were actively involved in the split of metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repetitive generosity, genital-toxicity, to carcinogenic potential and reproductionalism, the preclinical data will not recognize any special dangers to the human being.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane breakout is taken from the fridge - the temperature of insulin is taken to room temperature (not over 25 ° C) to rise before it is used under the manual for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1173">In both studies Allopurinol was applied at a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose urinary bricks in the blood has over the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study we had 48% (126 of 262) of patients, the Adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of patients who once daily use 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was with 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and on none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver levels.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with coronary heart disease, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in the lowering of the urinary tract in the blood as Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuritic leukaemia, which have already led to urine deposits (including one out of the medical history known or currently present Gichtknoting and / or a toxins).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum-sop stand after 2-4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), can be considered a dosage increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function, the effectiveness and safety has not been fully examined (Kreatin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and young people are not experienced in children and young people, the use of Febuxostat is not recommended in this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="1184">There are no experiences in organ-grafts because there are no experiences in transplants, the application of Febuxostat in this patient group is not recommended (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular diseases in patients with adult cardiac disease or decompression cardiac insufficiency is not recommended in the treatment with Febuxostat (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnsecular drugs, it can occur during the treatment start to become a acute case, because by lowering the serum harbular pile, initially can be mobilized in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. for malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-Syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a deposition in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver infections During the clinical trials of phase 3 were observed slight conclusions of the liver livable in patients with Febuxostat treated in patients (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore advised to perform before the start of the Febuxostattreatment and in the further course depending on the clinical report a liver work test (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylin Zwas no exchange studies carried out to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibition can lead to an increase in the theophylline of the theophylline (inhibiting of the metabolic inhibitor was also reported for other XO-Hemmer).</seg>
<seg id="1191">Probanden was the simultaneous gift of Febuxostat and Naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the Febuxostacy (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and T1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of Naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2-Hemp is not related to a clinically significant increase of undesirable events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be applied together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or at the same time a compound of other substance.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving proxy 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily an average 22% increase in AUC by Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate which points to the CYP2D6 enzyme enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be demonstrated that the simultaneous intake of an antacid hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide contains the intake of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) delays and a decline of the Cmax by 32%, but not significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of expired pregnancies can not be close to side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies cannot be close to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when paying a vehicle, use of machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities until they can be sure that ADENURIC can not be detrimental to their performance.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in terms of percentage of serum acid-acid concentration by proxy, regardless of their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney function).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary Endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum harnacid-concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40% of patients (APEX- and Fact study) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of data collected in the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum secular bricks refers to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) that needed less than 3% of patients needed in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment against a glove).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was also associated with a reduction in the ginal junction, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the plaster mark up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- Values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Febuxostat (5,0%) and also in patients who received the Allopurinol (5.6%) in the open long-term studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also led a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to detect the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing the vitamin D spy.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who have been treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than with those who exclusively posts Alendronat income (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data in front of the data contained in ADROVANCE, exactly the dose which is required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscle, bones, or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system (diarrhoea), constipation (diarrhoea), constipation (diarrhoea), condensation (slips), condensation (slip belly) as well as acid-encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with ettenant hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronat, vitamin D3 or any of the other components may not be applied ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be applied in case of disorders of infants, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following hints are to be followed just to reduce the risk of solution-hageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed after the day of the day with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not break the tablet or the tablet in the mouth, since a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera consists of. • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day, which shall take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic Ulkus, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgical interventions in the upper Gastrointestinal inaltrakt, except Pyloroplasty, only be given under special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Eco-hageale reactions, such as Öhagigitis, ösophageal Ulcera and ösophageal erosion, rarely followed by solution-hageal strotures, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partly were these severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that should be pointed to possible solution-hageal reactions, and the patients should be pointed out to the occurrence of menophageal irritation, pain in swallowing or retrospeculating sodburn the medicine and get medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of heavy-sharpenal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or to point it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a solution-hageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage transfers to the patient will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large scale clinical studies with Alendronat no elevated risk was established, were rarely (after market introduction) stomach and duodenalulcera, including some severe, and associated with complications, reports (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonekta of the jaw, usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including Osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime primarily dashed bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the insertion of a bisphosphonattherapy in patients who need a orthotic surgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteonekta of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment of the treating doctor is binding for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take them during the failure of taking a dose of ADROVANCE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their omiting.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets on the same day but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned at the intended weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D lack and hypoparathyreoidism), should also be treated before starting the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplement, antacid and some oral drugs can impair the resorption of alendronage when they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait after the intake of Alendronat at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific Interactionstudies have not been carried out, Alendronat was taken together with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines, without that clinically relevant interdependencies occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for applying postmenopausal women and therefore does not apply to nursing women during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronat leave no indication of directly damaging effects in regard to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1532">Patients with Hämophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell, in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced to the formation of the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advance is similar to another in the European Union approved medicines called Rephate, but it is made differently, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate Hämophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was examined by prevention of bleeding and in surgical interventions.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial use of the data, the CHMP has continued to assess the benefits risk-risk assessment, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore the CHMP is based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the eligibility in 5 years should apply for another reference procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited hosted the Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) that the company takes its request for approval for the Incorporation of Advance for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and relies) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advocin is a "AdenoScan" that has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger any infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancerous cells to make the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made from the non-broken in the human body existing p53-gene usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53-gene is broken, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study with a patient, at the Li-Fraumeni-cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP answers the answers of the company to the questions asked were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of initial submitted documents, the CHMP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After view of the CHMP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advance in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings advantages for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine by means of the body, the type of administration, and the security of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not been sufficiently demonstrated that Advance can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won the CHMP not about whether the withdrawal consequences for patients has currently participating in clinical studies or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advocin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug policy" "" "means that the tablets are so assembled, that one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other slowly will be released over several hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze will be applied to treating the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hypocrisy, by an allergy to pollen protruined inflammation of the nose-paths) in patients with nasal smal swelling (dusty nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aeropaze is to be taken twice a day, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (dusty nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes of the heavegrades of the hypotheupfymptomome that were reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients received their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When contemplating all hay congestion the patients reported Aerinaze, over a decrease of symptoms at 46.9%, compared with 35.9% in patients, pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed under Aerinaze a relief of symptoms at 26.7% compared to 26.7% in patients, the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tiachykarmic (Nichlaureation), slum, psychomotor hyperactivity (appetite), congestion, fatigue, insomnia (sleeability), sleep-dysfunctions and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenal agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a Engangle glaucoma (higher intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthydisosis (overvolatibleeding stroke) or had a risk for a hemorical stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe to approve the launch of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is contrary to swallow (i.e. without them to be smashed, to break or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied due to the lack of data to invalidity and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) not used for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use duration on 10 days because in long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper breaths, treatment can be continued when needed with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine, Pergolid, Lisurid, Ergokaitamin, phenylephrine, ephylephrine, ephedrine, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combinatory therapy were not examined for this patient collective and the data are not enough to utterance relevant recommendations on the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunctions and the data are not enough to utterance relevant recommendations on the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment at appearance of a hypertension or a tachykarst or by Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (like headaches or a strengthening of the headache) must be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups will be taken care of: • patients with cardiac arrhythmia are patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hyperyokardinfarts in Anamnese, Diabetes mellitus, Blasenhalsobstruction or bronchipasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to degenerate a minimum of 48 hours before performing dermatological testing, since antihistaminika can prevent other positive reactions to indicators for doorways or reduce to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine where erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, were not clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma-concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1680">During the results of the psychomotor tests, there could be no significant differences between the patients with desloratadine and the patients with placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This has not yet been identified for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsibly, so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycist.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The invalidity of the application of aeropaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictory properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, it may come to a workper, which may result in a impairment or ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart circulatory collagen) and a ZNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor) with possible lettering processes.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both the imitation of the release of proopic cytods like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastering cells / Basophiles as well as the induction of the expression of the Adhesion molecule P-selection on endothelcells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose-study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg have no influence on standard measurement sizes of the fluidity of the fluid or the tasks connected with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg was found daily no higher frequency of beats compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of Pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykarmic or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It participated in 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall concept for the symptom (except nasal smal swelling), significantly higher than below a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the declining effect, determined by the nose-out swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation groups.</seg>

<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic pritikaria was investigating for further forms of urtisharia, since the underlying pathphysiological ology of the etiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be marginalized more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histaminmates are a fundamental factor in all urinary diseases, is expected that desloratadin except for the chronically idiopathic pritikaria also results in other forms of urism to an improvement in symptoms; this is corroborated by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic pritikaria was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the descent of size and number of quaddling at the end of the first dose-intervalls.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic pritikaria and the profile of desloratadine are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadine can be exiled in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple disabilities in adults and adolescents, used in desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day over 14 days, no statistical or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1889">In terms of treatment duration your doctor will determine the kind of allergic rhinitis, under which you suffer and will determine how long you are taking Aerius solution to take.</seg>
<seg id="1890">However, in children under 2 years of diarrhoea, fever and sleeplessful side effects while in adults fatigue, mouth-dry and headache were often reported as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1891">97 Aerius solution for insertion is available in bottles with child-safe connection cap with 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 225, 225 and 300 ml.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) officially relieved that the company takes its request for approval for the inflow of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly for protection against flu, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 des influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a future pandea, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the Grippetion emerges, which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine the immune system recognises the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine being called "physical virus" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a flu virus that Stamms quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface anti-solids" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes human body as physical), unrified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the" good clinical practice "" "" (GCP). "" "</seg>
<seg id="1901">This resulted from the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the EMEA for preventive vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment please contact your treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also component of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are causing the acquired immune virus from type 1 (HIV-1) which is causing the acquired immune disease (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, axial is not available as a solution to inclusion, but this cannot be taken together with konavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Axiase should only be enumerated if the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines has been taken before, and the likelihood has given that the virus will appeal to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of konavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenerase according to body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase is reduced in combination with other antiviral medicines that keeps HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at low levels.</seg>
<seg id="1910">To do not cure AIDS, however, may delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of HIV related infections and disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without konavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adult, which had previously been treated with protesters numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This compared with low dosified Ritonavir increased medicine Agenerase was taken in 206 adults, which had previously been previously protesters, compared with other protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the share of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viral last) or the change of Viral last after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protesters previously, they had for 48 weeks under Aesthetic more patients an Viral last under 400 copies / ml as below placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In the case of children reduced, Agenerase has also been the Viruslast but by the children who had been treated earlier with protesters, only very few of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, which had been treated earlier with protesters had been treated, the Viruslast for 16-week treatment was just as effective as other protesters:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resisted against four other protesters, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of Viruslast after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous protesters previously:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 agenera must not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against Ambelavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Axiase may also not be used in patients suffering from currants (an herbal supplement to treat depression) or drugs, which are just as such as atherosase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, amongst patients suffering degenerals, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), a Osteonekass (Abdie of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection which will be caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) included that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacoinetic amplifier of Ritonavir but the Committee presented that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no protesters, have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as at the time of approval for scientific reasons, limited information is limited." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000 launched the European Commission of Glaxo Group Limited by means of a permit for the integration of Agenerative in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protesters (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually aspirated capsules to pharmacoinetic boosters of Ambelavir will be administered along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambelavir should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambelavir as a solution for insertion is 14% less than from Ambelavir than a capsule; therefore, axial capsules and solution can not be interchangeable on a milligram per milligram base (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aspirated capsules is 600 mg of ammetavir twice daily along with 100 mg of konavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If axial capsules are applied without the intensifying additive of konavir (boosting), higher doses must be applied to axiom (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aspirated capsules is 20 mg of ammetavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines that should not be exceeded daily (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmakokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenera in combination with low doses of konavir or other protesters have been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aging is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data to invalidity and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacoinetic data the dose to agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is supposed to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate likeying with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aging must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements which contain currants (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma-concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ambelavir during the intake of Ambelavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that axial or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asgenerals does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Aesthetic capsules are to be applied with low doses of konavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combi therapy, have an elevated risk for heavy liver interactions with potentially deadly course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the related informations of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including a chronically-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other Glukokortikoids, which over CYP3A4 is not advised, unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic mitigosteroider effects including Morbus Csore and Suppression of the secondary function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reduction inhibitors and simvastatin strongly depends on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of Myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), are methods of determining the substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Aesthetic may be less effective because of reduced plasmasping bricks of Ambelavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ambelavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given simultaneously with Ambelavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentment symptoms, especially if even lower doses can be administered from Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity due to the high prostitution of the axial solution of the axial solution to the insertion, this formulation is contrasted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Axial should be dropped on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or are involved in the mucous membranes (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including demonstrators, has been reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglykemia or an Exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with medication-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">At hammophiles patients (type A and B) which were treated with protesters numbers, reports on an increase of bleeding, including spontaneous hematomas and hooks.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In case of HIV infected patients with heavy immundefective patients may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is adopted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass-index), were reported cases of osteonekta in particular in patients with advanced HIV illness and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with small therapeutical width astoase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6-substrates with low therapeutical width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are associated for increased plasma bricks with gravating and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that rifampicin a 82% reduction of the AUC of Ambelavir causes that lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">By trying to equip the lowest plasma bricks by a dosage increase of other protoness inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very frequently unwanted effects observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum) The Serummirror of Ambelavir can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already involved in currants, the Amannihilation levels and, if possible to review the Viral last and curate the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is administered along with Ambelavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax to 30% lower, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Ambelavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, dosages of 600 mg of Ambelavir was applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily that occupy the effectiveness and irreversibility of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliated if Ambelavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambelavir in plasma, which was achieved during the combination of Ambelavir (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ambelavir (600 mg twice daily) combined with 100 mg of konavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Ambelavir and Caletra can not be given, but it is recommended however a narrow monitoring, since the effectiveness and irreversibility of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacoinetic trial used to apply Agenera in combination with Didanosin, but is recommended due to the imaginative component of didanosin, that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least an hour apart (see Antazida downstairs).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, during the gift of Efavirenz in combination with Ambelavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ambelavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protesters would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Neviral apin to other protections and existing limited data suggests that Neviral apin the serum-concentration of Ambelavir possibly lowers.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased / possibly subtherapeutic plastic bar.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be made, since a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambelavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambelavir and Rifabutin led to a rise in plasma-concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin around 193% and thus a rise of associated with rifabuine associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer the rifabutin along with agenerase, will get to a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmakocinetic studies with agenerase in combination with Erythromycin were not carried out, but could be the plasmasping bricks of both medicines will be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamputavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole compared to the value, which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamputavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below including substrates, inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with agenerase, may result in interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteholdermer it is advisable that antacid is not taken at the same time as agenerase since it can come to resorpulation.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulsion, which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with Ambelavir, can lead to a humiliation of the plastic bags of Ambelavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium block, such as Amlodipin, Štiazem, Feldicpin, Nicotopin, Nigedipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by 10 through Ambelavir, whereby possibly the activity and toxicity of these drugs will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with inhibitor can increase their plasma-concentrations in connection with PDE5-inhibitors in relation of side effects including hypotting and prioriism (see Section 4.4) amplify.</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of propionate plastic (4 times daily), whereas the endogenous Kortisol rose by approximately 86% (90% -Confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of axiom with Ritonavir is not recommended along with this glucooids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic mitigosteroider effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA-Refracase inhibitors like Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4 are pronounced enhancements of plastic bags in simultaneous administration of athercases.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma cutting resistance from these HMG-CoA-Refracase inhibitors can lead to Myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines with ammetavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations as far as to stabilization the mirror, since the plasma-concentrations of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in the same time of Ambelavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, axial must not be applied together with oral inaggregate Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same application of asgenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parentalem Midazolam with other protesters inhibitors on a possible increase in the plastic bars of Midazolam around the 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered along with Ambelavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentment symptoms, especially if even lower doses can be administered from Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given, such as the Ambelavir- dose to adjust when Ambelavir is administered at the same time with methadon at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">While the gift of warfares or other oral anticoagulants, along with an overase, an increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a mitigation or reinforcement of antithroemtic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of konavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predicted, therefore also alternative methods of conception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the use of agenera (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">"" "" "" "this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful breakdown of potential usage for the mother compared with the possible risks to the fetus." ""</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated Ratten, Ambelavir-related substances were proven, however, it is not known if Ambelavir is overstepping into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on laminated rats, which was administered by embedding in the uterus until the end of the downtime Ambelavir, showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight in order.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring including fertilization and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Ambelavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The invalidity of agenerase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the effects associated with the agenerase treatment were slightly up to moderate, occurred early on and led to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events cannot be clarified whether in connection with the intake of agenera or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protesters were not previously treated patients 1200 mg of ogenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4) published by the investigator doctors as linked to the study drug and were performed at more than 1% of patients, as well as in the treatment performed surgery (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy has been associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faunneal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominals and visceral fatty tissue, hypertropy of breasts and dorsocervikaler fat collection (stalks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretrospective, non-treated persons, which had been treated with Ambelavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium term of 36 weeks, was observed only (stalks) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, more than 27 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in combination with different NGOs over a medium term of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin attacks were usually slightly up to moderate, erythemed or makuypapulfs nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment to be broken with Ambelavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of Osteonekta were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV illness or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV infected patients with heavy immundefective patients may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of ogenerals twice daily along with low dosified Ritonavir (degrees 3 and 4) of those who were observed among all the symptom increases of triglycerid- and CPK values, which were obtained in patients whose agenerase together with low dosified Ritonavir received very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambelavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protrusion and thereby prevents the process of viral viral and gag-pol- Polyproteinsteps with the result of formation unconcealed, non infectious viral virus.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambelavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined in both acute and chronically infected cell line (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood-ymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Generating concentration (IC50) of Ambelavir is located in the range 0.012 to 0.08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.41 µm in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambelavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in human beings is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretrospective, untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamputavir / Ritonavir dosages were observed - as in other Ritonavir gebooed treatment schemas with proteasants - the described mutations only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretrospective, not previously treated patients, the 700mg Fosamputavir with 100mg of Ritonavir got twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure to be tested up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be investigated.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Genotype-based analyses of genotype interpretations such can be applied to the estimation of the activity of Ambelavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protesters-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamputavir / Ritonavir, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, M54A / C / F / M, I84A / C / F / M, I84A / C / F / M, I84V and L90M, with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological contact.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data, and it is recommended always to attract the current interpretations to the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Attributable to phenomenal resistance-based analyses Klincally valiant interpreting systems can be applied in connection with the genotype data for estimating the activity of Ambelavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir for patients with protesters-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that expel diagnostic resistance tests, have developed clinically-phenomenal Cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against Ambelavir Associated pattern creates a certain crosresistence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelsavir and Saquinavir remains generally received.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Ambelavir and other protesters for all 4 Fosamputavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2033">Conversely, Ambelavir retains its activity against some other protesters-resistant insulators; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders that can impact on the following treatment effects.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the effectiveness of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (Viruslast ≥ 1000 copies / ml) either with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidangling (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, soC) with a PI, primarily associated with low-dosified Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threesthreessixty (n = 163) patients with a weighted virus-sensitivity to agenerase, at least another PI and at least an NRTI have been included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-submission of APV / Ritonavir in relation to the SoC-PI group in the Viruslast (AAUCMB) in the Viruslast (AAUCMB) in the Viruslast (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-understatement shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of unsuroostered Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies asgenerase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonavir given at the same time; the majority of patients with PI pre-treated patients had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the patients received with agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the included patients included a plasma-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basics to these data should be considered in treatment optimization with PI pre-treated children who are expected to be considered to be expected from "" "" rugged "" "" agenerase. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum Serum concentration of Ambelavir takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases for Cmax to 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Ambelavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambelavir with a meal results in a 25% off of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambelavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) influenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and leaves on a large distribution volume, as well as an unhindered penetration of Ambelavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in plasma, whereby the amount of undispensed Ambelavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of non-class Ambelavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosage interdependence during the dosage interdependence in the steady State on the area of Cmax, ss up to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce CYP3A4 or inhiate or a substrate of CYP3A4 may be administered if they are given simultaneously with agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambelavir exposure to adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambelavir is made of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, axial solution and agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is neglected, therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low in the elimination of Ambelavir and Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2060">Until now in clinical studies no significant liver toxicity in patients have been observed, neither during the administration of atheroma still at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in juveniles, who have been treated with an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both at the control and with Ambelavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">With a systemic plasma exposure, which lay significantly under (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure among human beings, however, have been observed a number of minor changes including thyself-ongation and slow skeleton, which refer to a delayed development.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Ambelavir in plasma, which was achieved during the combination of Ambelavir (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ambelavir (600 mg twice daily) combined with 100 mg of konavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Ambelavir and Caletra can not be given, but it is recommended however a narrow monitoring, since the effectiveness and irreversibility of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ambelavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protesters would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be made, since a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambelavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer the rifabutin along with agenerase, will get to a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The Serum concentrations of calcium block, such as Amlodipin, xenoazem, Feldicpin, Nicotopin, Nigedipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by Ambelavir, whereby possibly the activity and toxicity of these drugs will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of propionate plastic (4 times daily), whereas the endogenous Kortisol rose by approximately 86% (90% -Confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>

<seg id="2185">If follow-up examinations 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesions are only incomplete, another therapy should be started (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">If a dose has been omitted, the patient should charge the cream once he / she has noticed this and then proceed to the usual treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod-Cream is applied in a thin layer and in the purified, with barrels to propel the cream, until the cream is completely moved.</seg>
<seg id="2188">It should be disputed in these patients between the use of a treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">It should take place in these patients a dispensation between the use of an treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible organ-repulsion or GRAFT-versus-host- reaction</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies, in which no daily pre-authygiene has been performed, two cases of severe phimosis were observed and one case with a trimming edge strokes were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">In an application of imiquimod-cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an elevated risk for heavy local skin irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases, were observed among facrestrained applications severe local skin irritation, which made a treatment required and / or to have led to a temporary bodily impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions at the output of the urethra came up, some women had trouble passing urine, requiring an emergency relief and treatment of the affected area.</seg>

<seg id="2197">If it is necessary because of the complaints of the patient or due to severity of local hood actions, a treatment course may be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical results of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since currently no data is available for long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment should be considered supervisous basins or other appropriate therapy forms.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs do not lie clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tumors.</seg>

<seg id="2202">Imiquimiodine was not examined for the treatment of acute keratoses, inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of imiquimiodine for the treatment of actinic keratants in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The data available via the acute keratose on the sub-arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application. therefore, such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local treads appear frequently, but these reactions tend to take back in the course of therapy or go back after the therapy with Imiquimod-cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">When the local pathways to the patient cause great discomfort or are very strong, treatment can be exposed to a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">The data of an open clinical study suggests that patients with more than 8 AK- lesions have a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>

<seg id="2216">The assessment of clinical signs included in these placebo-controlled clinical trials often result in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod-Creme frequently to local bonders including Erythem (61%), erosion / fading (23%) and Ödem (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This according to test procedures presented by clinical signs shows that in these studies with Imiquimod-cream very frequently came to severe Erythemes (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and too heavy scarring and salestion (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">For clinical trials researching the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinent keratose, alogezie was found with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental-time recording of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could cause nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgias and fever.</seg>

<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-time ranged approximately 10times higher than the 2hour half-hour after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retention of medicine by means of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimeters to topical application was low from patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with acute keratose or superviscosal cell cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to dermal toxicity for the rat led toxicity in the rat led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg led to significantly down-weight body weight and increased Milz weight; one also four months long-run study to the derpainting application surrendered in the mouse no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinoma in mice with dermaler administration at least three days a week induces no tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption out of human skin and is not muting, is a risk to the human being due to systemic exposure than very small to look.</seg>

<seg id="2284">June 2003 informed the European Commission of Genzyme Europe B.V. the approval for the transport of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of humanly α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by means of recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal-cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is used for long-term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mukopolysaccharide I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who possesses the experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been identified and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver sufferinsufficiency was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as each in connection with side-effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be supervised even closer, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment where replacements are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, expected to form almost all patients IgG-antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction, must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because little experience is due to resumption the treatment after a longer break, must be cautious cautious due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after a interruption of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamine and paracetate / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or reduction of infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion, in which the reaction occurred to be resumed.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquine or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of laronidle is made.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that have been exponentially over the mother's milk, it is recommended to not satisfy during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were derived mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drugs in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>

<seg id="2307">Children invitations drugs in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phas- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with overwhelmingly severe delay form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a seroconversion, with the patients aged under 5 years of age with a heavy expiration (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days at patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature payout of the study) cuts in 13 / 45 patients not by radioimmunopmodifying agitation (RIP) Assay provocable antibodies before, including 3 patients, where it never came to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-antibody mirror reported a robust reduction in the GAG spy in the resin, while in patients with high antibodies to ascertain a variable reduction in GAG in the resin.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2-2 study) showed a marginal and minor neutral effect on enzymatic Laronidastics activity in vitro, which seemed to not impair the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in the resin.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be in connection with the incidence of undesirable medicine actions, even though the occurrence of unwanted medication actions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the acute substrate and the prevention of another accumulation of formal restoration of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidle is quickly removed from the circulatory and absorbed by cells into the lakosomes, most likely about Mannose-6-Phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase-3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the entire disease spectrum reported was the majority of patients from the average phenotype and only one patient pointed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forcized explicit volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters to walk.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the prematurely FEV and the absolute walkway in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension, where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treatment to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the oconductivity that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in deraldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period of time and the absolute lung-volume increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) by the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was fixed, which remained consistent until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease balance between the patients, which summarizes through the use of a combined final version (to the expected percentage of AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was undertaken a one-year-year-2 study conducted by Aldurazyme of Aldurazyme at 20 patients, which were dated at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy clamp form and 4 with the middle chamber).</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active shape goes more easily in cancerous cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of medication by means of a longer lifetime in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelian Alimta was examined in a main study at 456 patients who previously did not receive chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-wise lung cancer the effects of Alimta were treated in a study to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, which previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), and both in combination with cisplatin in a study on 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the notes in tables 1, 2 and 3 which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients non-hematological toxicity enhance level 3 (except for neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIZTA must be interrupted by the patient the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be cancelled, if in patients after 2 tin-reduction, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- due to the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have given no indication that in patients aged 65 years old, or in comparison to patients aged 65 years, an elevated risk of employment exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age based on non-sufficient data to invalidity and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinin Clearance from ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary that go beyond the dosage recommended dose for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base for patients with a Kreatinin Clearance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients were examined with a liver-functioning of &gt; the 1.5-edge of the upper Bilirubin- Borvalue and / or Transamh values of &gt; to the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver hepatitis), not specifically examined in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must not be monitored with regard to the buttonic markers and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutralization number is again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thropod speed has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutron-number, Thropod speed and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as neutrropenie, flintsiie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neutropenie was sworn when a pre-treatment had taken place with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients must be instructed to be treated with pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for reduction treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous non-steroid medicines (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylsic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and minde- Tens 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a therapy with Pemetrexed is foreseen, the intake of NSAIDs have to avoid treatment for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occurred, had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid supply - accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the ergometer in front of the Pemetrexed treatment should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myokardinfarts, and cerebral calendar events have been reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of the attenuary circumstances (except yellowing-fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible shafts is diplated by pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the treatment advance to obtain advice regarding the sperm production.</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses can be applied by NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylacid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, in the day of therapy and minde- Tens 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs, with a long semi-term potential like Piroxxicam or Rofecanob, the simultaneous application with pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the scent status during the illness and the possibility of interdependencies between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio), if the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in swangers, but as with ande- antiminites are expected to be expected in pregnancy severe birth-defective.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary and after thorough completion of the utility for the mother and of the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group did not appear enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemotherapies received, which are strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi, in which 24 hours after chemotherapy was not omiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of the patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (126 out of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi, treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron's patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron the values of 63% for alxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005 established the European Commission of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for approval by Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicted: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strong emetogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderate-etogenic chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is inducing through a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding one prior to the corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon-pionage, patients should be monitored with anamnestling obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however caution is advisable for the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with drugs which extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt- interval is extended or that tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemical therapeutics, aloxi is to not be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In prehistoric studies hemmed Palonosetron does not inhibit the activity of the five examined chemical therapeutics (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamid, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacoinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady quiz concentration, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one on a population based pharmacoinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Ininhibitors (Amiodaron, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluonavir, Ritonavir, Sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies do not lie, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is deemed necessary by the treating doctor than necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly with aloxi related to, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of survival actions and reactions to the deadline (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies showed themselves from unwanted events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, there is probably no effective therapy with an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blinded studies have received a total of 1,132 patients, which had a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphate and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron (half-time 7,3 hours) received, which was given to day 1 without dexethasason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients, which received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cycloarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron received, with patients who were given 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-based chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc-Intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of Palonosetron, Palonosetron has the ability to block the involved in ventricular de- and repolymerization involved and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Probanden study was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous Gabe performs a slow elimination of the plasma-concentrations on a slow elimination of the body with an average terminous half-time period of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma-concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-) are generally proportional to the whole dosage range of 0.3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous generation of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacoinetic simulations forth, that once a daily intravenous generation of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron ended in 3 consecutive days reached overall texposition (AUC0-) with the value of 0.75 mg measured value, however, the Cmax after the introduction of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and roughly another 50% are converted into two primary metabolic ites which have compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolic process have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent that Isoenzme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 have participated in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron have been recovered about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered substance made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolusinev, the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Though, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions, the terminale eliminations and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical trials effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From the preclinical trials, references that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionenchannels which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the lifetime memory lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose expressed in about the 30th of the therapeutic exposure to humans) that were given every day over two years, resulted in a more multiply frequency of liver tumours, pituitary, pancreas, pannial mark and skin tumors at rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high dosages and da Aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results as for the human being is very low.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this permit has to inform the European Commission about the plans for the market entry in the framework of this decision approved.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the prediction of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injecting solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is similar to a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same pharma-efficient component, which is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Frame").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-standing) hepatitis C (one through a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">With a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue is indicated, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Amino ransferase (ALT) increases in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data prior to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medication by means of efficacy, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 consisting of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the preparation of the treatment to the drug (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed in detail that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug must not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment of Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After hiring the treatment with Alpheon flammates the disease in more patients than in the reference medium; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the assessment methodology included in the study was to determine what extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) does not validate sufficient validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with Krustenance-related skin infection) and small infected lafics (Riss- or Schnittwunden), slitting and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not supposed to be used to treat infections, or probably caused by methicillinresistant staccoccus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo against these types of infections may not affect these types of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied with patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface must not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient speaks not to the treatment two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial reef (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby hemmed the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was receded after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo were applied to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin, Altargo and Cefalonia showed similar contact persons, when the results of both studies were gathered together at Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups attached to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was caused in the treatment of abdominal cavity (failed cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA, or probably due to MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which has been observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee of Human pharma (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during the short-scale treatment of the following superficial skin infections over the risks are exaggerating: • Impetigo, • infected little Lazerations, slogans or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission adopted the Glaxo Group Company Ltd. for approval in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which within two or three days no bettering shows, should be investigated once and be considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of an awareness or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment broke off, the obe carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will commence.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retriapamulin is intended to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary open wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant staccoccus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- to 3-day treatment no bettering or worsening of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retriapamulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which has been reached by humans for topical application on shiped skin or infected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2-times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the mean reapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin pbe on a meager skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be kept required when topical retriapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a re-production-toxicity according to oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the foetus / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied only during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the stituting has continued / ended or the therapy with altargo continues / ended, between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infants and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied, the most common reported side-effect on the agreement, which looked about 1% of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active ingredient Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivate of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passive seckery (formerly Pleurotus passive seckery).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain bonds of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the ties of other rigenomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bonds of the Bosnian protein L3 involve and lies in the region of the rigenomal P-bonds and the Peptidyltransferasal centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment to this binding station hemuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of the resistance, the application of Retapamulin may appear in at least some infection forms, should be pursued through expert advice.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aurens, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-reference to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virus factors (such as PVL = PolovValentine leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study involving healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion and applied to girded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma maple were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic shot at the person after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 abdicated skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP's inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolic ism of retapamulin in human lives microsummer has been primored by CYP3A4, among the reduced participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed more than 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of two doses existing vaccine, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine can be brought to an end for two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is required against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another hepatitis A- or -B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it may be against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twinrix adults since 1996 and since 1997 approved the vaccine Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines will be used for protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered into a vaccine administered by three cans.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix contain rix and Twinrix adults, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of the vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection on the development of protected antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix had a similar gap between the injections and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headache, appetitions, pain on the injecting location, redness, Mateness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic) do not apply.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission distributed the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. inter alia, a permit for the induction of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardisation plan for the Grundimmation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose dates back to date and the second dose administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refrescoworker is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalous vaccines or with a combination of combinable.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis-A-virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A-virus (anti-HAV) anti-antibodies are in the same scale as after vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet entirely backed whether immunoous individuals who have addressed on a hepatitis vaccine as a protection, since it may also be protected by immeasurable antibodies possibly by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gross of vaccine, adequate opportunities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the Standardisation scheme is recommended with the Combinationary recommendation, the 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In heretic patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, after the pridimmation, there is no adequate anti-natal and anti-hbs anti-antibody, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intra-muscular administration might lead to a suboptimum reflective success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Throsycytopenie or bleeding disorders, Ambirix may be injected in subtracted substitution as it can occur in these cases by intra-muscular gift of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix had been administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellulae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective need to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vaccinants of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, Maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thiomery and preservatives.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccination ambitions have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the 3-doses compressor.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher prevalence of ache and matrix on a basis of calculation per vaccination, but not on a basis basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of ambirix at 50,7% of the probanden, compared with 39,1% at the proportion of a dose of 3-cans compression.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccine-cycle reported 66.4% of the Probanden, the Ambirix had received, about pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects, which had been vaccinated with the 3-Dosage compressor.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The incidence of maternity was however comparable per prosag (i.e. over the whole vaccine at 39.6% of the Probanden, the Ambirix were compared with 36.2% in the probes which received the 3-cans combination.).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of predefined pain and mat was low and comparable that was observed after the filing of the Combinationary accept. it has been observed with the 3-doses vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccine, the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the Ambience class was comparable to that in administration with the 3-doses formalininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- until 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix had a common appearance of pain (on the injecting location) per dose, not reported per prosl.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that were reported about severe side effects during the 2-cans vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B- surface-surface, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were performed at influenza in the age of 1 to 15 years, the seroconversions for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 given dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversions for anti-hbs were 74.3% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 given dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2764">At the 289 individuals whose immune homogeneity was worthless, the Seroprotekeepers (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-Dosage imp were significantly higher than with ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response that were reached in a clinical comparison study at 1- to 11-year-old a month after completion of the full vaccine (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-cans vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of pridimmation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that, made after vaccination by 3 doses with a combination of combinant hepatitis, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivation hepatitis hepatitis B-surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- up including 15-year-old could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunisation in 0-6- months vaccination scheme is to be compared to the 0-12-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose ambitions in the second year at the same time coincide with the refresher mitigation, tetanus-, azellulae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles vaccine vaccine was sufficient, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">An clinical trial, which was carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar to similar Seroprotekee- and Seroconversions as for the earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective components per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated carbon-A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced content to effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and may give you a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is suffering from people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle tissues. • If you / your child are weakened with your child due to illness or treatment in your body's body, or if you / your child can pull out a tick bite.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix cannot be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on the vaccine can not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction is to the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient to the vaccine and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">When another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as many limbs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulinen, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without the needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has been known since issuing the first approval for the market entry, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk-relationship for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix had only been placed in traffic from a Member State (the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security dates are limited to this medicine due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defective or with hyperammonious bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonk is divided - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed under food or via a gastrochaz (through the abdomen in the stomach of leading hose) or a Nasensonde (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps could not be compared with any other treatment or with placebo (a headquarter drug, i.e. without any substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to appetite loss, a abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, irritability, abomiting, vomiting, vomiting, rash, impurifying, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human pharma (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps was effective in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle to high ammonium levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because due to the rarity of the illness at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicative in all patients where a complete enzyme is already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late maniffixed form (incomplete Enzymdefect, who manifests itself after the first life of life) there is an indication for use when in Anamnese a hyperammony encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing is AMMONAPS also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually according to the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of natriumphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with an body weight over 20 kg as well as for high-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from a earliest lack of carbylphosphate synthetase or ornithinchicarbamylase is the substitution of Citquirlin or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine-synthatase deficiency need arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered by patients with sip disorders, since a risk exists for the emergence of Ösophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Any tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium butybutyat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium and demnification of clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolic and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate takes place over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied with patients with liver or kidney failure solely with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous generosity of phenylacetate at young racks in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came into a slowing of neuronal recovery and to become an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nervous system in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noticed whether phenylacetate retired in the mother's milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients occurred at least an undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 year old abomax patient who developed a metabolic disease in conjunction with Laktatazide, severe hypokalemia, Pancytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred with a 5 month old small child with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosshlimiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection that is controlled by acetone with glutamine to phenylacetate glutamine, which is deposited over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atomas); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the excretion of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle may be thought to be produced for each gram soulated monosodium butyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetate glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment immediately is started to improve survival chances and the clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of early manifests form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in newborn period was almost always infaust, and the disease led even when dealing with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their sticky free analogue within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through Hämodialysis, the utilisation of alternative paths of nitrogen-phenylbutyrate, sodium and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival-rate newborrowed at postpartal (but within the first period of life) diagnosed diseases on 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonmish encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifests form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of ornithinchicarbamylase-deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperammonmish encephalopathy and then were permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinous diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is contaminated in liver and kidney enzymes with glutamine, whereby phenylacetate glutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and of its Metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by virtue of a single dose of 5 g sodium bisphenyl and with liver cirrhosis after indices as well as repetitive gifts from oral cans of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disease was also examined with cancer patients after intravenous generation of sodium butybutyat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oralen single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrate in tablet form were established 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma-concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycosis or hamoglobinopathies, after different doses phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after night-consuming fire was not phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">For three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium butybutyat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylactic acid concentration in plasma tiles on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours of about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugate of phenylacetate glutamine about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus-testing, Natriumphenylbutyrat with with toxic and non toxic doses treated non-stogenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h for oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who are not able to swallow no tablets or patients with difficulty disorders) or via a gastrochaieschlauch or a nasal sonic.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteiny in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from a earliest lack of carbylphosphate synthetase or ornithinchicarbamylase is the substitution of Citquirlin or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram Natriumphenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium butybutyat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox will be applied to the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood vessels to the heart), for example in instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myokardinfarinfarts (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomaltibility in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Becomes Angiox on preventing blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximate 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effects of angiox at all-types or in connection with a glycarotein-IIb / IIIa-Ininhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding, especially if Bivalirudinal is administered in combination with another antioagulans (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in case of PCI patients under Bivalirudding, most bleeding may occur at arterial points of points, patients who undergo a persecutaneous coronartery (PCI) while treating principle anywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated warfarin and treated with Bivalirudinal, should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudinal treatment should be achieved before the treatment of existing levels.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from knowledge about the efficacy mechanism of antioagulants (Heat, warfarin, Thrombolytic or Throotzygemmer) can be assumed that these substances increase the blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudinal, with Throsycycations or antioagulants, the clinical and biological hemostal parameters are regularly monitored on a regular basis.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bivalirudinal, alone significantly less often than in groups with Heat plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidation, plus GPIIb / IIIa- Ininhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events: intraction, retromental bleeding, or blood circulation in a point of point, which a radiological or surgical intervention required of ≥ 4 g / dl with a known bloodstream, reoperation due to blood pressure, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations that appeared in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points, retrospecitoneal, hospitable, ear, nose or neck.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects which are not listed above have been reported after an extensive use in practice and are summarized in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudinal treatment is to be removed immediately and the patient to monitor with regard to signs of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox includes Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombine inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the animonenbindings region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The liaison of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin, on the one hand regenerates the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby generates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by Bivalirudin with serum of patients, in which it had come into the past to heasinduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), does not induce a Throotcyte Aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudinal is shown in a dosis- and concentration dependent anti-dependent effect caused by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was done in the case of the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg is given as infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable sine or Enea was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronarsyndrome (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / non-ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients supplied limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacoinetic properties of Bivalirudinal were evaluated in patients suffering from a persecutaneous Coronarinterventions (PCI), as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptid expects a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reuse of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolit, resulting from the division of the Arg3-Pro4 attachment of N-terminalen Sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombine.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm injected or as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to the control of glucose rails (sugar) in the blood or the insulin may not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulinglulisin differs very little from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter lifetime is considered a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin cannot be effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glycosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.1% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes, lowering of the HbA1c-concentration 0.46% after six months with Apidra, compared to 0.30% in human normal-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin anisin or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood-glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Avatar Deutschland GmbH for approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal cloth, to apply or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal cloth.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and the diminished insulin installation, the insulin may be put down in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (origin), the insulin (normal, nPH, galvanization etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or the breakage of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoaziosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another incur type or a insulin of another manufacturer should be under strict physician supervision and may make a change in dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the efficacy profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in the switch of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemia, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (MAO) -Hemmer, Fluoxettin, monogameyllabyllable, Propoxys, Salizylates and Sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics like Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserves the symptoms of adrenergen counterregulation be shiped or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductionalism showed no differences between Insuelinglulisin and humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic development, birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether Insulinglulose enters into the human breast milk, but in general insulin occurs neither into the mother's milk, nor becomes it resorated after orting application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical trials known from clinical trials, grouped according to system subclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their appearance (very often: ≥ 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of the availability information is not hidden).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird failed to change the injecting location within the injection pane, can result in the result of a list podystrophy at the injecting location.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with consciousnesses can be treated by means of an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a correspondant person or treated by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glow object the patient should be monitored in a hospital to ascertain the Ur- thing for the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous ga- be made by Insulinglulisin the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hubrmanem Reginsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1-diabetes, TUS shown Insulinglulisin in therapeutically relevant metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, a disproportionate increase of the microcosal effect, just as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulinglulisin has a twice as fast impact, such as normality humaninsulin, and achieves the complete glucose effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandial glycemic control is achieved as with human normal timinsulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Became insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal, was achieved a better postprandiale control than with human normal timinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Will Insulinglulisin 15 minutes after commencement of the meal - turns a comparable glycemic control as with human normal timinsulin, which is given 2 mixes before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal regulinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (normal - previously) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
